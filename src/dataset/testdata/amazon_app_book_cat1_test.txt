story moved smoothly and had enough twists and turns to work the brain . a pleasant read for a rainy day .

this superb book makes mythology real ! beautifully written . forgive the cliche , but it was hard to put down , ... pure and simple .
this had to be thought up by someone in the medical profession . very interesting subject keep in mind this could happen to us some day
this is the first book i ever read by this author . i have to say that i really enjoyed it . i look forward to reading more of her books .
well written . i got caught up and am now wondering what will happen in the next book ... there has to be one !
i would never have thought of combining some of the foods she combines in these recipes . gave me some great ideas and expanded my range of choices to make .
this is a delightfully clever book ! this provides a wonderful opportunity for children to discover the good news after getting the bad news ... can a child see good coming from bad ? a great read aloud book !
suzanne collins is one of the most amazing authors i have ever read ! great book ! this book brings together the entire story from the first two books in the trilogy !
little disjointed at the start but a good ending . clever plot line even though spoiled rich kids is a little cliche .
i enjoyed the story but compared to other good books that are also series , the price is high . i feel like each series could be a bit longer for the price .
once you read the first book , you will want to read the other 2 books , it is a heart breaking story but with hope alive .
sometimes i just like a good romance book and this was one of them . some parts were a little corny but it was still one of my favorite reads .
great book ! i read it all in a day ! i wished the ending would have been a little longer because i really did n't want it to end ! ! !

ann hood deals with grief in such . a beautiful way . i have not lost a child and hope it never happens but she has turned a tragedy into an art form .
i have been reading her books for many years and have never been disappointed . every time a new one comes out i order it and have never been disappointed .
i love these pictures . they are great to see day after day . every time i look at it there is something new inside of it .
this book really makes you think . the author did a great job building a world that is believable . this book will scare the hell out of you .
just as good or better than ethan . read the book in one day and immediately started the next one in the series .
if you like historical romance i will like this book . i would like to have a bit more drama but the plot does have a few turns even if predictable
this book will keep you reading ! some little twist here and there and off in another direction before you know it .
great book ! i was so worried i would n't like it when i started it , but it was well thought out and extremely entertaining
i understand all of these young people have had or still has problems . i just felt like i was reading the same story over and over .
martin is simply an incredible author . this story just keeps getting better and better and i cant wait to read more .
not the kind of book i would normally read but the story kept me intrigued and by the last half i could n't put it down . wonderfully written
not my style of book . did not get very far before i quit reading . really did not remember choosing this one .
started i little slower than the other one , but did not take long for it to get interesting . you could almost feel as if you were a part of the mystery and you could solve it yourself .
i hated this book . i found it to be nothing more than a soft porn mystery novel . it is my 1st experience reading this author 's books , i do n't think i 'll read any more .
enjoyed the remarkable , but equally flawed characters in this story . the basic understanding of southern culture and how we are formed from generations before us was sympathetic . a beautiful setting for any story .
this book is so awesome that i have read it twice . i would recommend it to all ladies ... there 's something in there for all of us : - )
everything he writes makes me feel like i am in the middle east with him . thought provoking . very good read , could n't put it down .
this book is wonderful ! i love to draw and it has been easy to do with the help of this book
the book is definetly a good read . the book focuses on love , betrayal , and redemption . after you read the first couple of chapters , you will not put it down .
. . . there never was one . . . and never will be . . . the book is totally pointless . . . i have deleted it from my kindle
then you ca n't go wrong here . i love follett and this book delivers . looking forward to book three in the trilogy .
fun for kids , the pop up feature has my on reading on his own . great illustrations as well . will look for more from this author .

i have n't read this author before so i was really surprised with how good this book was . great read with a nice plot .
i was a little shocked at how enjoyable this was to read . i read it in one day and found it very enlightening .
it has several projects , this for beginners ... just to get idea on how and what to make . it can be a good reference book .
this was another great story . i took a day for myself and read this entire book within six hours , taking only a few breaks in between . it was great .
every book marie force writes is a 5 star for me . i love her style of writing and just have to keep reading the book to the end . i ca n't wait for her next book .
this book is wonderful for anyone who wants to garden in nature 's best interest .
too wordy , too much unnecessary info . it goes on and on about nothing . i finished it only because i wanted to see what happened at the end but most of the book i skimmed through
i enjoyed reading this book . it definitely kept me on my toes and in complete suspense . i recommend this to anyone that loves a great murder mystery .
everyone needs to get a book like this to understand our economic state and how it got to where it is now .
this book is for the `` new knitter '' who has not been around much and has not seen many of these ideas in the original for . some cute patterns .

page turning entertainment ! enjoyed each book as much as the one before ! would recommend this trilogy to everyone who wants to be entertained !
this book was fun to read . made me laugh out loud at several points . i 'd recommend it to a friend
this book is great along with the rest of her series . the author is able to keep me engaged in this series , even after all this time .
it makes sense in it 's basic premise , and uses examples to back it up . if you want to fix the country , this book needs to be your guide .
it was fine , but the leads are all too perfect , the plot is predictable and it 's all too formulaic . well enough written but not a keeper .
i have a thing for cops and i like how this story is played out , if only there was a deeper ending to it like they get married or the separate and meet again or something like that .
this was a good read and i 'm really happy to have read the next in this series . well worth the read .
short stories can make or break a book . in this case it broke the book . the stories were n't very mind blowing .
i agree with others , this is the only book you need on the subject , i highly recommend it . this book answered all my questions and gave me a lot of helpful information , great book !
no matter how far apart or how long apart that one true love never dies it always stays with you

really enjoy the novels by richard castle , both the storm and castle series . good story structure , good characters , plenty of suspense and action .
amazing gory book . fantastic mystery that answers all your questions by the end of the book and puts everything together . you are wondering who really is the bad guy .
this is the perfect book to keep you safe in the garden and elsewhere . the information is detailed enough to help write any mystery thriller .

loved the series but really did n't like the ending . i understand why it happened but could there have been another way ?

loved , loved , loved this book ! and to think it was a true story made it even better . so sweet !
good read ... scary ... more so since it comes from the author 's personal experience . makes the reader think ... and worry . i recommend `` eyes '' to mystery buffs .
the period of time this story takes place explains why it is such a dark story . you will hate some characters but you will enjoy others and you will enjoy the book .
a really a great love story , you 'll enjoy the whole series . well written you wont want to put it down and say oh man at the end because you want more
super fast shipping . very helpful instead of looking everything up online . takes you step-by-step through many different things . i found it very useful and helpful . i would highly recommend !
nice easy read with her usual sense of humour and a nice little double plot and also with an unusual twist at the end .
i ca n't tell you how much i enjoyed this book ! ! ! i read it most of the night ... into the early morning , and just finished it now ! ! ! read this book !
i like the way this woman writes . engaging story and likeable main character . i am looking forward to reading more of her books .
nicely written , but these days it 's a very typical romance story . the call girl part was a but of a twist tho ; )
ok , story sad but true . i 'm sure many teens could identify . the young mans devotion was amazing
it just did n't appeal to me in content or writing style . i would n't buy it and probably would n't read anything else by this author
wow ! i laughed , i cried , i got mad , and most of all intrigued . just when you thought you figured it all out ... ... you had n't .
no plot just one night of hot sex , that 's all there is to this short story . not sure why this story was necessary . maybe i 'll know in the novels that i will read next .

i read the first and second books in this series in two days ... i could n't put them down ! off to read the third book now ... those dishes can wait anyway right ? !
such a great prequel to caught up in us . it sets the story line before you get into the real story . i just wish kat and bryan 's story was a series ...
i loved getting a little bit of background from each one of the steel brothers . i love each and everyone of them and ca n't wait to read the next book in this series .
i just could n't get into any of these stories , nothing pulled me in . i said that i was going to give it another try some time later and leave another review .
i read this book with my kids . we enjoyed quite a few of the jokes . some were really corny , but for the most part it was good fun .
i liked the fact that this book kept moving and the characters kept changing who was in charge . he was quite a good character so was she . hard to put down .

my daughter sort of liked this story but there were n't many pictures to keep her interested in the book so much .
not to pleasant a subject with too much off putting language ( for a girl ) setting bad example for younger readers ? could have had some lighter aspects ?
this book was all worth the read . i could n't put it down . the story had my attention from start to finish .
you can easily get caught up in the emotion of each page . enjoyable with laughs , suspense , anger and the heart felt grief of loss .

id love to read more by this author . the writing is nice and easy to relate to , fun content , very interesting
the only thing i 'd like is a bundle offer for it . and an editor that does n't sequel it to death .
it was more interesting than the first one although the first one was more believable . but it you read the first one you might as well have read this one too .
this was imaginative and had me involved in the story . i really wanted to know what was going to happen to the present and past character . would like to read more of this persons work .

i love all the alex cross novels . this one was riveting and intense . loved it ! ! i could not read it fast enough ... ... .
simple but sweet set if books about this family of bears . good read aloud books but maybe not enough to interest a beginning reader
this book was free so i started reading it . could n't get into it . did n't finish . it was boring and i could n't find an interesting plot .
a somewhat predictable read but i what i loved about it was the honestly and not your typical ending . this book touches on real life .

really liked this book , however it took me little time to really get into the plot of the story . once that i got on into the story i really enjoyed it . love stories with babies .
started and finished same night . not too much of the pass not really detail to the story . maybe all of the books should have been combined .
good sci-fi but have read better just did n't keep me interested . sometimes boring lack of appeal will not finish the series
nothing too great but not the worst thing i have ever read , needed more about the characters and so on
this is the best book i have come across to explain what has gone on in our government and why it is so dysfunctional . it really is a must read .

a silly plot and boring characters , i just could n't be bothered reading beyond a few chapters which is a big call as i usually stick with a book once i start it .
i enjoyed the book very much . it was well written and the characters believable for a christian romance . could n't put it down once the story really got rolling .

werewolf dreams is an alright read , not one of my favorites although it was refreshing that it didnt follow the same predictable pattern of most paranormal romances .
i think this one has less action than some of the others but its a good addition to the series .
my ex was a big james bond fan , so i thought that i would read it . i thought that it was an easy read and easy to follow .
because it is so small that i ca n't read the words and it is too condensed . i 've given it to a younger person .

i had a hard time getting through this book . it failed to hold me at the interest level i found in his other books .
this is a good introduction to the series . a little hard to follow until you dive in and get going . then you feel more like you are getting to understand the character you are following .
twist and turns that i was n't expecting . the end was interesting , and i thought it to be kind of lame

very well laid out . easy to read and the maps are fantastic . ca n't imagine planning my trip without it ! ! a must have .
i really liked this book . it should be required reading for all students in middle school . it tells about life and the -- -- that can happen , but it ended up being very uplifting .
dean koontz is a master storyteller . this book kept me reading from cover to cover , i did n't want to stop , but at the same time i did n't want it to end .
just as good as good as the first one in the series . now i will be going to get the next one .
i really enjoyed reading this book . the author did a good job of keeping things moving and interesting . it just hurts your heart to think that things like this truly happen even more than we know .
i absolutely love this product . my daughter asks me to read it to her everyday . i had one of their products years ago do i 'm glad they have stuff for toddlers .
number three is the best yet . summer and her quirky family are a hoot . the story is suspenseful and read well . lots of romance too . recommended read .
i loved this book and it 's characters , ca n't wait for the next installment in the series !
this is a hilarious novel . feisty characters and funny situations make this a fun read . age is definitely just a state of mind !
i got this book for free and absolutely loved it . i would recommend it to anybody ! it kept you on your toes and intrigued to see what would happen next the entire book !
a cute story for teenagers and also has the sad part to it that does not make it a typical happy ending but life is n't always like that
another good read . jodi always has a way to keep my attention . my daughter and i share interest in her novels .
this actually made me laugh could n't put it down ! ! ca n't wait to read the rest of the series and find out more about the characters : )
loved this book . the plot kept moving and characters were well developed . the ending was a shock and the perfect end to get the reader begging for the next book .

donna has done it once again , her books are very interesting , easy to read . enjoyable . she makes you feel like you are right there with her characters . you want to continue reading .
it 's a cute book about differences but it is definately for older children and probably does n't need to be sold as a board book for younger ones .
ok this was a good book but it was way too short . i think it had the ability to be an awesome book with its great storyline but it felt like it just ended .
i loved this book . it contains a great message of love . this book could be used as a reference for anyone with personal issues - that , of course would mean everyone .
i chose the book instead of the movie . whether you believe it or not it 's a very entertaining story . the imagination of the author is excellent . now i want to see the movie .
this is a good book i was not expecting the book to end that way . need part 3 in a hurry !
great story line . the good guys and action . this is a great series . hope there is another book in the works .
i liked the depth of characters the author created , along with the how advanced the era is in which the story is told . it is well written and has good humor as well .
the book started a little slow but was getting interesting when it ended ! more to come , i want it now .
i think this is a very good book . it 's a good romance novel and has quite a bit of very sensual content . i like the author a lot . a good , smooth read .
i have been sewing for years but will enjoy going through this book as a refresher course . i thought the price was right .
i really enjoyed this book . although i figured out most of the ending , i liked finding out how she tied it all together .
but written in a way that an adult will enjoy it . nick 's story grabs you and makes you feel for him .
do n't waste your money . this book is juvenile and boring . i 'm sorry i purchased it . i ca n't seem to find any good westerns .
this was a book that you did not want to put down , a very enjoyable read and i would recommend it to anyone .
this was a very cute story that ended very well . i really enjoyed a nice ending for a change without having to wonder about the what if 's or heart breaks ...
this book gets your attention from the & # 34 ; get go & # 34 ; . if you like excitement in every chapter this is it ! i would recommend this read to anyone .
i really think that the books are getting shorter and shorter , but you just have to have it when you start with the first one . great books , very addictive .
great story , great character 's , great action , great plot , just one fast moving ride . a real great ending ! ! this author will get another read from me , very well written .
the series is a long one and well suited for me . i travel and read alot and this series by nick thomas is a good read . at time improbable but interesting .
excellent book , it had a lot of good lessons on how not to live . always make god first and family second and then work .
i ca n't believe i read any part of this book . it is nothing but depressing and i want my money back . i was trying to read it for the sexy parts , but they even sucked .
cute book for a little girl . my 7 year old enjoyed reading it before bed time . it may have been a bit too easy though .
interesting ! a totally different concept , and it worked . a well told story , give it a try .
here is a book that helps children understand that being first is n't always what they might expect it to be . cute and my students love this book .
my second harlequin book . it was a great story and i loved the characters . i definitely recommend this great book .
not a bad book , but i think it got a little silly toward the end . i do n't think i 'll order the next in the series . there are a lot better series out there .
i do n't usually read zombie stories but this one has me hooked . the characters are well developed and well rounded . some parts were sort of predictable , but i still loved the story .
i love the entire series ! each and every one of these books are well worth the read ! the stories are great !
great book . can be used in a day to day life situations . might not work in europe due to cultural differences
this book literally reached into my mind and did things with my imagination i could never do myself . i want to go back and read it again .
i thoroughly enjoyed reading this book . if i can apply these principles maybe i can improve my life ! fantastic book !
by far , not what i expected at the end of the story , but it ended with a happily ever after . i ca n't wait to too see what happens in the last book .
once again , a great story ! the book kept you wanting more . i love the characters and the growth of the feelings between them . i highly recommend reading this story .
book is great . loved the book , it was a good second book of the series . i thought it was just as good as the first
awesome book you can learn alot from this book even if you are a beginner
i do n't want to give anything away . it was fascinating looking through the killer 's eyes . not saying who the killer was ...
this is a different story line . interesting , lots of twists and turns . i keep thinking about it , even after i finished it . definitely recommend it .
well worth getting , let 's hope that the future is n't anything like what is portrayed ! will make in interesting movie . people have to wake up !
this is another addition to the book series . it is wonderful . great for the young ones who are just starting to learn about other cultures . this really holds a child 's interest . very highly recommended .
this is the best one yet . even though i do n't think it is possible , craig johnson 's books just keep on getting better all the time .
this book is so much fun to read . for something easy and enjoyable . the characters are fun and sexy . it will make you laugh .
ca n't put the book down ; fascinating read , as good as the move , a book all americans should read , the information is invaluable .
i really enjoyed this book . i liked how the story was told from early in their childhood to present day . the book kept me engaged and moved at a quick pace .
harlan coben is one of my favorite authors . this was another of his fast-paced , you 'll never figure it out thrillers . super enjoyable read .
overall it was a pretty good read . ending could have been a little more & # 34 ; fleshed out & # 34 ; . would have liked it more with more detail and length .
opens up the business world in a new way to allow us to think out side the box and achieve our goals and dreams .
enjoyed it so much ! the story changed on almost every page , and the author was lol funny ! ! going to order more of his thrillers !
i enjoyed this book as much as the first two . the story line flowed all of the way through but this book had a new story with a new direction .
loved this book ! i really felt the connection between the 2 characters . it was a heart warming story and smoking hot ! ! a definite must read .
i have n't tried knitting these hats yet , but the instructions look fairly easy to follow & the designs are very cute .
very well done . i think rick riordan did an amazing job . i really enjoyed reading it and i know my kids will too !
i love this writer . he takes me far away from new york into another way of life and makes me love everyone in it .
a thoroughly good read . i look forward to reading the next in the series . the writing is crisp and the logic is good . nicely told !
it was funny and romantic , i loved it so much . already read the next book in the series , just as awesome
this is a compelling read . what kept me going was the wit . everything is good , the plot , characters , suspense , but the wit makes the book work .
thoroughly enjoyed this . had a nice mixture of science fiction , drama , and suspense . author does a nice job of keeping the story interesting and believable .
i like marie - but i have tried to get into this book - i must not be in the mood for it at the moment .
i enjoyed this book . the supernatural is something i 've always been interested in , and this book uses a different twist than most .
i thought it was one of her best books . i just read the white queen and it was an excellent continuation of the story . full of beautiful detail .
this was a good book . i found it a little predictable . that does n't keep me from recommending it . you may enjoy it more than i did .
great book . i would differently read another book by her . i could not put it down . will be getting another book by her .
this storyline is a little bit different but that 's why i liked it . you never knew what was going to happen . ca n't wait for book 2 .
must read if you have ever been in love : ) i was able to relate to her character and heartbreak and was glad of the ending .
no edge of your seat moments . i read his first book and thought it was much better . not enough suspense .
i liked the story but once in a while it seemed to jump out of context of what was happening . it was interesting since i know something of the area described in seattle .
i really enjoyed the story . they could have made it a bit longer and still had plenty to happen . all in all tho it was a nice quick read .
it was interesting to follow along to see where it would lead , worth the time to read time well spent .
i have really enjoyed each book in this series . the characters keep developing and the story just keeps going . there are no long gaps of time between each book .
read this one , the first one and you will be craving the second one , then the third one , and so on ...
i enjoyed reading this book . it made me laugh a lot . i never could guess what was going to happen next .
out of focus was an enjoyable light mystery . i found myself not wanting to put it down and looking forward to the next chapter . upon finishing i purchased another book by the same author .
i enjoyed the stories and recipes . it was worth the money spent and met my expectations . i do recommend it .
ca n't wait for next book to be released this summer , not my favorite author of this genre but third ai n't bad ! anne rice then jr ward .
this is an enjoyable book with twists and a good story ! well written - i read it quickly , but it was hard not to !
i absolutely loved this story . the details were spot on . i like the love making parts were not skipped over . it truly was a realistic story . i will recommend it to all of my friends .
violent , violent , violent , lots of twists and new spin on apocalyptic stories . a must read for zombie lovers ... really good , full of action , one of the best i read ...
what inspiring stories these six people have . well written and reads easily . makes you understand that we all have strengths if we but look deep .
not what i had expected or my style of writing . did not keep my interest very slow and some what boring
interesting story but very dry and very long . with a little more editing it could have been better . but very unusual and interesting .
full of great recipes and stories . i really like this little book . it was a great business deal for me .
i have read all the books and i love i wish there were more ! ! ! `` hint this was a good one
the plot kept twisting and i love every second of it . i have to say i never saw that last chapter coming , but it made the book .
i just found the story kind of weird . it was endearing and i overall enjoyed the book , but just was n't one of my favorites .
this is a great book . it is a book that is a must have for any home library . it is a must read .
a bit wordy but worth the effort to receive inspiration from a biblical character . application is appropriate for our society .
i hope i 'm reviewing the right book . it 's been awhile since i read it but i really liked the characters and thought it was very funny and entertaining . meant to find the next one .
i found this bible to be very helpful to me , it was what i had expected . it showed a little wear but not bad at all ,
these are easy to use and give so much background and understanding to passages that are sometimes hard to figure out . well written and will eventually own all of them .
too predictable plot . the descriptions of the relationships were so-so . may try one more by author to see if he improved .
good read . a definite page turner . c j does a good job of capturing your interest and keeping you on the edge of your seat .
guess has created something great with this series but i fear he 's losing track . it 's weird to say , but he gets too preachy sometimes . just tell me about killing zombies !
quite a surprise as this is the first time i read a short story by michael connelly . but it left me wanting more ... too short
i enjoyed this book , action , adventure with a hero that has feelings but is focused . i would recommend this book
great heart warming story . loving pets is very real , no matter what our history is . young man with great ideas , loyal dad with painful memories and mom who loves them both .
i just do n't think the hot bunch ca n't get any hotter ! kristen ashley just keeps going ... ca n't wait to read the next and final rock chick book !
this book is original and super cute ! i really enjoyed reading this book with my child . it held her attention . the illustrations are beautiful . i highly recommend this book !
book came in perfect shape and in a very short period of time . very pleased with the book and the service .
i saw the movie and i really liked the book . i think that i need to try more of this author 's books .
the star of this novel is anything but lazy as he tries to help his neighbors with their wild problems ! ! ! highly entertaining if you want a `` light '' read .
reading the blue sword is what really got me into fantasy back in elementary school ! i love all her works & this is a great collection at a good price .
really enjoyed this one . highly recommend it to others . ca n't wait to get to the next book and see what 's gon na happen next .
a good story about 2 people who live next to each other , initially not liking each other , then falling in love .
terrific read , up to carter 's usual standards . he has blown open so many stories on tv personalities over hot e years it is hard to believe he gets the access that he does . very enjoyable .
this one brought tears to my eyes and appreciation to my heart . i believe anyone reading this can not come away without an appreciation of the love available from our pets .
easy to read ! i would recomend this book for anyone that want to find out about the use of herbs . informative and interesting to read .
i though that this is a great story . it is well written with interesting characters . i recommend reading the three books in this series in order . this is the third in the series .
i like reading the amish books ... very interesting and i 'm learning more and more about the amish community ... keep up the good writing
liked the book & am now reading the other books that go 's along with this series . you will enjoy it !
it is better to purchase the series instead of each individual book & cheaper . i fully enjoyed this series & look forward to reading the others .
this book was disjointed . had difficulty following which voice was writing . would not recommend , not even for a fun vacation read .
the book was a christmas gift and requested by the recipient , so was appreciated . a second individual is already planning to get a copy as they were intrigued by the title .
i enjoyed this book although i felt it left many questions at the end . i would have liked to know more about how their date went and if it worked out .
the story was entertaining . but a little predictable . would like to read to know a little about john story . look forward to reading .
i really loved this book , was a hard one to put down . i am now desperate for the next one to come out . would definitely recommend it !
interesting story , however , i felt it was drawn out a bit long . a lot of jumping around - difficult to read at times .
this book was a very enjoyable read . like her other books i really enjoyed this quick page turning intriguing book .
great book . not what i was expecting at all . very happily surprised .
this book has a different outlook on how vampires live among us and i loved it . once i started reading , it was hard to put it down .
rollins does it again . blood gospel offers a ride you wo n't soon forget . a new cast of characters to enjoy !
i had a hard time getting involved in this book . the style of writing is just not my favorite . i found it disjointed and wordy . and the end left me feeling a little cold .
love happy endings and i love christmas stories . this was both in one ! relax and read it yourself and enjoy !
interesting story , east to read , finished in one day . character conversations written in the way they talked , so was fun to read . the conclusion was a surprise .
i liked each book in the series a little bit less than the previous one . it is just ok in my opinion .
this cd set was very well presented . i saw the movie and this dvd added more details , quotes and inspirational ideas . overall it was nice to hear while driving . i give it 5 stars !
i think that if you read the first book , then you should be compelled to read the rest of them . i did .
it was suggested by one of our teachers in school for us to buy this book and am glad i did !
this book has helped me to understand the grace of god like never before . i will read it again to get the content into my spirit .
enjoyed reading this book and i would like to read the rest of the series . the characters were interesting to figure out .
it was a great read . i always enjoy reading an exciting book . really action packed and always keeps you guessing .
this is one of my all time favorite book ! ! love it ! great story ! ! ! : ) : ) : ) : ) : ) : ) : )
i did n't really like this first book as it reminded me too much of the other nora roberts trilogy that i read the key trilogy . i liked the characters and the setting though .
like the short stories . very creative . i do n't have a lot of time to read so this is perfect for me .
this is a really good read that should be made into a movie ! the story is heartbreaking , romantic , steamy & leaves you wanting more !
alittle tough getting into the book initially , interest wise , but now it is getting more to the point of interest and providing the meat of the title .
it 's amazing what a person will do for money , and the guy ended up with nothing but the shame of what he did .
too sexual for me . very disappointed . i bought the whole series and they all have too much sex in them .
i could n't finish it , it just was n't able to hold my interest , and i generally like thrillers . maybe the action picks up later in the book .
the characters are so rich and well developed . it was so easy to get caught up in their lives and in their world . wonderful story beginning to end .
bit far-fetched . not the usual quality from baldacci . hopefully his next novel will be what we have become used to from him .
this book grabbed me at the first page and i could n't put it down until i was finished . well written and exciting - i would definitely recommend this book to anyone !
this is a fun series good fast mystery story quirky characters all blend into a story that continues into each book
i have read all of her books and i love them ! ! ! ! she has a way with words that makes you laugh ...
i love my five levels . i listen to it on my way to and from work for inspiration and guidance .
the size is right and the written portion is good , but not enough birds ; the book should include more birds .
my daughter likes reading classics . this book was exactly the classic she asked for and it has pleased her tremendously !
once again leonard has put together a storyline that gets you the reader involved . this is a fast read that is hard to put down .
i liked this one as much as the other and ca n't wait until the next one . this is definitely a great series !
this book was very interesting and enjoyable . i ca n't wait to read the remaining books in the series , just started book 2 .
a perfect follow up the previous instalment , full of twist and turn , as expected . now we must wait for the conclusion . hurry up already !
i love this book is it just me or does drew have a career in writing 2 good great book
i downloaded exactly one app from this book , but if you figure the book was 99 cents & app was free , it 's not too bad . other 's might find more things of interest .
i really enjoyed the love that she has for him . really like the story and ca n't wait to read the rest of the series .
although the story line was good the editing was terrible . i 've read suzanne wright 's later book which i enjoyed immensely , this book was far from decent .
exciting , entertaining and very informative . no matter what books you typically read you will enjoy this one .
it 's an okay book but not all that helpful , the cover says more then whats on the pages , little bit boring .
a terrific book that took me somewhere new . i had never heard of the orphan train before and it was quite a journey ! good read .
book started out kind of slow but pretty quickly got better . i would buy again , very entertaining with some rather unusual concepts . very good book .
it began about as sad as a story can , but then becomes wrapped in fun , adventure , and the limited hope of fulfilling last wishes . he wraps up nicely , in an encouraging , hopeful conclusion .
started out slow . as i read further into second & third book it became hard to set down . sad it is over , definitely recommend this trilogy !
it was a really fun book to read and sexy too . just wish it was one of a series . samantha young is a great writer
i was n't impressed with this book although it was a quick read . very vague . i did n't learn one new feature or thought .
great book with a wonderful ending . it always keeps you guessing . even though i read it before i enjoyed it a second time .
this book brought smiles and a little sadness . it was a page turner . i love how vivid the writing was and his way of story teller . josh green is very talented !
another excellent lost lord novel . wonderful to see the minor characters in other of the series get their day in the sun .
this is a wonderful book . the piece was an inspirational tribute to the father . some times life makes us think about who were our heroes . this book speaks volumes of the hero dad the author had .
initially i did n't think i 'd enjoy this book as much as i did . job well done john green . you deserve all 5 stars !
loved it i ca n't wait to finish the series . big girls do it better then a stick figure . go read this book
a sweet story to be enjoyed . i enjoyed reading this book . touching , sweet and a unbelievable ending . if you enjoy nicholas sparks , you will enjoy this story .
as with all authors , given time , they come up with reads that hold interest and prompt you to continue reading . i liked the flow and the characters fit well together .
i wanted more and more . this book has somehow kept me connected even though i was no teenager or in high school . the story can relate to anyone at any age .
i enjoyed reading this book ! i absolutely love all of your books ! i ca n't wait to read the next book !
very enjoyable ! a funny side of the boys you do n't often see . very nice to hear some positive comments about the & # 34 ; girls & # 34 ; from the men in their lives .
not sure why i am being asked to give another review on this book , but it is a very good story with very good characters .
ca n't wait for the next volume ! it just gets better as we go could n't put it down this time around
all 3 books were good , every book was about different character and different story but all of them where connected . i was hooked from book 1. very good story line , writing .
loved this book ! i passed it on to two other family members who also loved it !
all the recipes in this book cake mixes cookies are easy to follow and come out delicious . i would highly recommend anyone to purchase this book .
i have n't started it yet , may have read it but i wo n't figure that out until i decide to go ahead and finish it anyway .
this was a really good book , the kind that when you finish you instantly look up the author to see what other works they 've done . interesting story , good writing , solid character building .
now the only thing i can say about this book is it was too short , just when your started to really read the book ends . i just hope the second book comes out soon
this book was fast paced and intense . it was dark and gritty . it was a great read . i am anxiously awaiting the next one !
well written as always . now we wait for the next in the series . hopefully it is on the way , and continues in the same excellent manner as the previous books in the series !
good book- i really enjoyed it ! i have read all 3 books in this series , and this was my favorite .
i loved this book . i could not put it down . highly recommend this to anyone . i love her style of writing .
ok when will the sequel be out ? i read the book non-stop . the formatting was a little off but overall very enjoyable read .
i wish it was longer than this it was great though i liked it though it was also interesting from beginning to the end
i was n't surprised , this like all of debbie macomber 's books have me hooked from the beginning . great stories & great characters ! ! !
one of the worst books ever . way too many words used to describe things i could care less about . would never , ever read this author again ! !

this novel gives the reader a lot to think about . well written , captivating , thought provoking . some parts a little predictable but definitely worth reading .
these books are thought provoking . this is one of the best series i have read in a very long time .
my little ones had a hoot because they enjoyed the adorable illustrations . you can see the look in their eyes when this little monster gets told the same things they do .

this is a great series . the books have a quick pace and plenty of twists to keep you guessing . ca n't wait for the next one ! !
this was a good read i read it while working out and i was never bored . it would make me work out longer because i could not stop
why in the world did i download this weird little short story ? do n't do it ! buy a real book , instead !
also started reading this book , not doing anything for me , but i 'll continue reading and see what happens , give it my best shot
great read . angst , sweet , sexy , hot , emotional ... this one has it all . katie ashley writes yet another fabulous book . loved it ,
my grandchildren are not a fan of the box books as i thought but of course stories are great to read all time
good story telling . history as it might have been in a period of great transition in actual history . interesting idea throughout the book .
i loved the story line and how it all played out . everyone has a dream , and i like how hers came true .
i bought the book on kindle to take on a trip right after the movie came out . i really enjoyed the book , it was a great read .
this book has been invaluable in my personal study of the bible . i have purchased another to keep at the church for the use of others .
great book ! he expressed himself well . we have truly lost a wonderful talent ! he worked very hard to get where he was . died to young .
great book , very hard to put down at night . plenty of action and a good story . i look forward to reading the entire series of books .
i enjoyed reading both these books . probably would n't read a third is she writes one . good quick read if you want one that is easy , funny and requires little thinking .
this is not what i expected . it was more . i look forward to reading more of ms. white 's work . when does the next one come out ?
i liked the book . sometimes it was too detailed , sometimes it just dropped off in never never land . however if you could ignore those parts the book itself was enjoyable .
historically interesting though the stories are immature in their development . perhaps a bit too much on the technology side and far too little on the personal ( character ) side .
wow , a nice guy with a big heart and sexy as hell . my type of book . this is a book you will want to read , over , and over again .
really interesting . it was the new translation that i bought . i 'd read the old translation years ago . this one was great !
i ca n't wait for the next book to come out . this was too short a read to satisfy me . please hurry !
the different writing styles and genre variations are fantastic , lovely collection , great price and i have n't even gotten to the piece written by my favorite author !
this book was much better and held my attention more than gone girl . i believe i will read dark places right away !
what can i say ! ? two hot looking men struggling with life and the love they share ... i 'm glad i gave this book a try !
loved this book from the moment i opened it . could n't put it down from the moment i opened it . it arrived on time and not damaged at all
i think this is the worst book i 've read in a long time . the entire plot is dumb . would not recommend at all .
one of the best reads in a long time . highly recommended to anyone who likes a very different well written story
enjoyed the book . would consider reading another by this author . characters were everyday people . a little slow at times but overall a good read .
i gave several as gifts to 5 year old girls & they loved them . lots of fun to do with them .
had a hard time putting it down . as usual dan brown has kept me on my toes and held my attention .
loved it part too is a must read . i love to read about a female who not only street smart but book smart and she was able to find love ! ! ! !
this is a great off the wall writer . stories make a weird kind of sense . i would like to have more of these , love the way this guys mind works .
i cried , smiled , laughed . this is a wonderful second book . loved it just as much as the first and cant wait for the third
this is a fun summer read . light and humorous . i always need a good beach book and carol snow books fit this bill every time .

a great voice , written as a diary , a page turner ! the first in the series , i have reread them all twice in two years

very involved but very interesting . i enjoyed the time spent with these characters . that part of our history is fascinating .
pretty good book , it could have been longer though sometimes smaller is bigger . the story captured many scenes but the one that it should have been more descriptive in was probably the most vague .

the story was a good read i enjoyed it and found it held my attention will read the next book
the first book is really good , but the other two do n't have as much new insights . he does love god though and you can not help but be inspired by them all .

this book is a great book . it is a mix of divergent and the hunger games . some things are a little intense though . overall its an excellent book !
another great book in the series . wo n't go into detail , but i was hooked from book 1 and have read all 6 .
this book had a great emotional storyline . definitely a good romance to read ! ! i really love all of abbi glines books !
but then it all went down hill . hated the female lead , selfish woman who did not deserve either of the men . dont bother , no really dont .
very entertaining and well written . i wish i had simply bought the trilogy right from the beginning ... once i got started i just had to read all three of the books .
good book . i liked the characters and the way the story unfolded . it was a simple love story . i have read other books by this author . i will be reading more .
well written , extremely interesting story line , love the past life references and historical accuracy . i found it hard to set this book down !
i liked this book it just took a while for it to pick up , i 'm glad there was more about the family members on both sides in this book . it helped to explain things a little better
each book was very well woven into the one before so you just want to keep reading . want to get books 4 and 5 now !

i bought this audiobook for my mom for mother 's day . after she listened to it , she love it & i am so glad that i bought it for her .
i read this book decades ago and was so pleased to find it on kindle . the short stories are timeless and still ring true today .
i do n't know why i chose this book months ago . it was a beautiful story about the author 's childhood , faith and the tragedy of losing her beloved daughter . a very moving story .
i read this book from beginning to the end and it held my interest somewhat . it is not one that i would highly recommend to anyone though .

really enjoyed the whole series , author kept me interested until the very end ... i was just sad to reach the end of the series !
i give this a 3 maybe 4 stars i liked it it kind of dragged in the beginning . i enjoyed it for the most part
the plot was to mixed going in to many directions with no finish to most of the plot . just not well written .
i enjoyed the book nothing special jumps out at me but the characters were well developed as in the past .
i loved of jake 's books so far . i also liked how some characters show up in the different series she writes . she shows how her characters overcome issues and fall in love . erin .

had a great story , i love the way she finished the book and how there was the one last struggle to over come
romantic mystery loved every word kept me going to the end would recommend highly to all who enjoy reading this type of book
a little too pat . characters are flat and uninteresting . felt i could skip whole chapters and not miss a thing .
an engaging read , with characters that i cared about . a wonderful beach read of a book , light enough for the beach , but satisfying enough for any time , any place .
it was fine , but i did n't seem to love like the rest of the world . i am truly disappointed that i did n't enjoy this novel as everyone else did .
i love the brain that can come up with stories of other places and people to entertain the rest of the world .
a story of what is wrong in the world ! i 'm sure this book is fictional but i would believe it may be closer to the truth then we are comfortable .
i love epic fantasy stories and have found this to be a great one . i will be reading the whole series and enjoying every minute of it .

great book , i also have read the whole series and would recommend it highly for those in to zombies and that type of reading
wow , this was so much better than i thought it would be ? i am trying to catch up with the rest of what she has written .
better than i expected & a little frustrating at times ( how can she not see what 's right in front of her ? ! ) . just be warned ... the author leaves you hanging at the end .
in reading the book , you know right away the other side of the story so maybe i would have made the same decision . i really enjoyed this book . it made you think and feel .

very enjoyable story to read . the author kept the reader engrossed in the story right to the end . thank you
i absolutely loved this book . there was plenty of suspense which i like wished the ending would of been different but still a great book
read it really quickly but it was not as funny as i thought it would be by reading the summary in the back . do n't think i will be reading it again .
this was n't a bad book , the plot was thin in places , and in others it dragged . all in all it was an ok book and it was free .
i did like it , what street was here , and what street was there , i just think it was dragged out to long
being a connelly fan of most of his work , but especially the harry bosch series , and after that character , the lincoln lawyer guy ,
nice escape reading and seemed to me to be well written . i have read other stephen king works as well .
great book . this is the first one that i 've read from this other . i 'm going to be reading more from them very soon !
good plot , lots of action . liked how the relationship between grace and ray evolved and changed as the story developed and the truth came out .
a fairly good story . had some suspense wrapped around a love story . i did have trouble with keeping track of the names of the different sub characters . their parts were too many and not well defined .
i really enjoyed this book . i liked how crazy jesse was . i thought it was funny : ) . ca n't wait for the next one !

not the most in-depth or detailed , given the book length , i enjoyed the book , will read more by this author .
i was n't expecting it to be about a baby , but that is probably because my kids are older . it is a sweet book to read with any child , and my whole family enjoyed it .
great book - good story , great characters , pretty well researched on the historical storyline - great book . . . .
cute fun story ! ! ! this was a light clean refreshing christian romance with a sweet story and likable characters !
absolutely loved this book ! ! it was a captivating story . exciting from the beginning and continued right through to the end ! ! truly a great idea for a plot .
loved the beginning of this series but hated the ending . what a waste of my time . if you want a happy ending do n't read the end
a really sweet book both for children and adults . a good book to start with after the loss of your pet . a great comfort to give as a gift to a child and adult .
very interesting pictures & stories on the characters ... helps me understand the story and the era that this television series is about !
another great taylor series but very disappointed that because i did not buy the boxed set that i will not be able to read the finale .
it 's a surprise right from the beginning . at times i had to figure out who it was they were talking about . for the most part it was an interesting story and unexpected outcome .
this was a short story but a good one . a follow up would be nice to see how it all plays out .
was interesting a lot is going on but still was n't as good as the description sounded but it was okay reading
interesting read . i would have liked to have more of a backstory on the bad guys , but i thought the author did a good job of keeping a fast pace .
this was my first time reading a book by india but i must say it is far from the last ! looking for all her others titles now ... . starting with part 2

kept my attention from chapter to chapter and is fun to share with the kids i come in contact with .
nothing new . i was looking for some good tips that would help me pass difficult levels . not very much information .
no deep thought needed for this book . a bit more detail about how to kill people than i needed . over all an entertaining adventure .
i was really hoping for some dramatic new ideas and concepts . the book is good , but the concepts are not unique . the cover art is by far the most exciting part of the book .
loved this book ! great chemistry between the two main characters . looking forward to reading more books from this author . she is new to me .
three short tales to keep you guessing . harry is the main character and he is the constant in each story . well written and worth your time .
i enjoyed finishing the series . it was a sweet love story . the plot was not expected and yet it was .
i 'm hanging by dear life here . the action , the suspense , the love triangle , in loving it . still rooting for drake ! ! !
it is a good story . better than the first . the intimate scenes in both books have been a little repetitious ... the storyline is exciting . i love a good romance novel .
i really enjoyed each of these stories . they were very exciting and fun to read . forgot all about my intended projects and read the whole set . thanks for an enjoyable afternoon !
this is a bit expensive for a small book , but has some good detail . they should have added additional order of battles for the various years of the war .

this was such a great way to complete this story ! ! was on the edge through the whole story and i liked how their story was completed ! ! a definite must read ! ! !
good writer , but a little too much bad things happening . no rest for the dead 's author , sandra brown , is always a good choice for a satisfying read .
this was an excellent book . i found it hard to put down . ca n't wait to read the next book and the one 's to follow .
this is a really nice book . i enjoyed reading it very much . i read it several years ago and i still use some of the ideas from it .
while it 's true that i like to be surprised by the ending of a mystery novel , this ending was so out of left field as to be unbelievable .
seemed to drag on and on . did not even attempt to finish . i am no help at all . good luck
very well written , this is the second book in the series - i ca n't wait for the third book to come out ! !
i love this recipe book . it has a lot of recipes that will be easy to try . i like the layout and the design . worth the purchase .
the truth . thanks for serving your country with honor . we all appreciate your pain and determination and remain free because of you and yours .
i was just getting started when this story ended . it was an interesting beginning . it could be developed into a longer story -- or not .
you ca n't get any better than this . such wonderful characters come to life in your minds eye . great storyline that kept me spellbound .
this book is a great read for adults but some editing is needed when telling the tales to kids .
if you read this book , you might as well plan to buy the remaining 11 books terri has released in the mary o'reilly series . they are very addictive .
i am not generally into short stories , i prefer full length novels . but i did enjoy this book , the stories were fun and sexy .
my 6 year old was laughing through the whole book . she thought it was great ! even i enjoyed listening to her read it and laugh . good book for kids !

very good love story i felt sad for david cause of his brother and father i will tell all my friends
night of the assassin is a great opening to the series . it draws you into continuing the series . the best part , it was free !
an easy read . too few characters developed to any depth to leave a lasting impression . maybe there will be more depth in the sequel ?
gave to my son and he was so excited he had been wanting this it is heavy and well made worth every penny .

sometimes you get lucky . this series was excellent in character development and storyline . once i read the first book i had to read the others . i will watch for any new books by shane gregory .
while some of the book is a riveting read , unfortunately other sections seem to drag on and on . the best sections are his ww2 and vietnam flying ... the rest is just okay .

one of my favorite books of the year . do not miss out on mia & ben ! ! you wo n't be sorry !

easy reading . interesting and entertaining story . fairly well written . good characters in a good setting and context . ending is a little flat , but apart from that , enjoyable on the whole .

this book was crazy ! it 's too real ! ! so many twists and they kept me hooked from the beginning ! you did the damn thing ! great job ! !

i was caught up in the book immediately and it held my interest to the end . i have enjoyed all of david baldacci 's books .
not a lot of excitement to this story , but a sweet romance book . could be g rated as there is not a lot of steam in this book .
this was a short story that was a quick read . when you want to read something short , this one is for you .
good theory , but a little too technical . its difficult to study something in detail and then write about it to the general public in an interesting and teaching way .

some good information but not enough for a whole book . use you good sense when taking money advice from a non professional .

wonderful book ca n't wait to read more is there another in this series ? i am really into historical fiction twisted with time travel .
i love all romantic novels especially historical . most of them tell how people lived in the times before we were born .
this is a really cute book for kids . it 's easy to read and so enjoyable with the rhymes . the illustrations are perfect and really add to the story . your kids will love this book !
i found this book to be close to useless -- extremely hard to figure out how it 's supposed to be organized , close to impossible to find anything .
excellent as always . i was a little disappointed that alex stone , ended up a killer in any sense even though the victim was a killer also .
fast paced with interesting characters , this book keeps you up reading later than you may like .
poorly written , lots of spelling mistakes that often makes it hard to understand what the author means . there are much better books out there .
not the greatest , dont particularly engage with the characters , but i am finishing it . the author has potential if he can bring the characters to life more
it was an enjoyable read . the characters were surprisingly well written for this genre which was a nice change . also , one of the better free books i 've gotten on amazon !
this was a great book i ca n't wait to read the rest of the series ! i believe i experienced every emotion capable with this book . it was very suspenseful at times .

i love parker 's books , and was expecting this to be as exciting as his novels . ca n't say it was , but the history about the author and his ideas for his books was worth reading .
love karen white and all her books . just ordered her new one which is in hardback but have n't read it yet . i know it will be wonderful . they all are .
having come across this concept am now wanting to learn more and believe me this book has opened my eyes to new ways of eating .
this is great book . it combines a historical perspective of the world 's fair in chicago and a murder mystery all in one !
this was a good book but the problem of one of the main characters is n't resolved at the end of the book .
this book was such a good book about friends , and how both these girls survived a terrible tragedy . how they became best friends and how god worked in their lives .
this author does not develop or describe characters or the setting . it is difficult to picture the character or setting . the plot moves quickly to the ending but does not take the reader there smoothly .
if you are out for a literary masterpiece , then you should probably pass on this one . a quick read with little depth , go for it .
short read but believable plot and characters . life is hard sometimes but happy endings still can happen . erotic romance with a plot .
the idea was very creative . i did n't love the way it was written though . it felt a little disjointed . still a good book

book 2 of the the series is just as good as the first . loved the characters , the storyline , and pacing . very well written and edited so it 's worth the money .

a legal thriller that i could n't put down . characters and story line were very real with an unexpected ending . i highly recommend this book .
an excellent tale . it was so good that i could not put it down and was through it in two days .
could n't put it down ! i love to read and this author was new to me but was happy to find someone who could write so well with out all the sex and back language .
i found this book to be a boring read . the characters were likable enough but i did n't feel any chemistry or passion . i wish i had liked it more but it was just so so ...
great novel . takes you from wwii to present day . historical fiction adventure are the first words i can think of to describe this work .
i really enjoyed this book . it stayed exciting throughout and the character descriptions were on the money . i highly recommend it .

a story about the one that got away , the brother , not the fish .
a good read . more patience than i would have , but loved th ed background story . will read other books by this author .

my husband and i both enjoyed this book . i read it for book group . it was well received by all .
i enjoyed the book and the way the story line led into the problems that both of the kids had .
this book was fairly good . it is unique in that its told by a male narrator . interesting characters . good set up for the next book .
this book was not all that and it was a bit slow , seems to me should have been more intriguing but all in all an ok novel
i enjoyed this book . i was well written and i liked the characters , which is important to any book . i enjoyed the journey to the main character as well as the storyline and it 's progression .
this one took me a couple of weeks to suffer through . the story was not realistic , neither was the dialog of the characters .
as my honest opinion i thought it was easy to many point of views i was getting confused but i liked it
my book club decided to go with this book . it was ok but not a page turner . a bit sad for me

if you are not dark and open minded this book is not for you . i loved it and i think it should have been longer !
i enjoyed the characters . the story dragged in several places . i will read more written by mr walker . i look forward to the next .
this book had no climax . it stayed at the same pace throughout and that got old . i finished it just to see how it ended . not interested in the sequel .
was shorter than it should have been . i liked the little i got of the characters personalities . needed more writing .
john sandford does not disappoint readers who like a story that moves along . lucas davenport is a smart tough cop who thinks and acts fast . i love the `` prey '' books .
was a fun fantasy story . you can enjoy the main character and how she tries to overcome her problems while helping others . the ghost 's involvement just made the story even more fun .
well , once i started the series i had a lost 4 days . i really enjoyed each character and am looking forward to reading other books by this author .
i loved this book . it had me from the beginning . i ca n't wait to read logan 's story next . you need to read this .
too graphic for me and language use was over the top or bottom if you like . story line was very good and i enjoyed the characters .
these books have every aspect for what i consider great reading . they had wit , sadness , happy times , and good plots that held my interest until the end
it was amazing . the suspense , the action , the intriguing story was a great combination for a powerful message . get this book , you wo n't regret it .

not what i expected . the story took me very much by surprise . the ending is not the typical ending . bravo for cheryl taylor
i really like the simplicity of some of the recipes . delicious recipes and user friendly , what more could you ask for ?

what a great story . i laughed until it hurt . i have read several books by this author and believe this one is the best . please read this book .
i learned so much from this novel . i had no idea about the involvement of women in wwii -- women doing dangerous jobs . i found it fascinating and intriguing . loved it !
keep an open mind when reading this book . it is really good . chance is a strong , likeable character ; his journey to correct some of history 's events is very interesting .
the writer did an excellent job of pulling me into the story . it is well written . i am looking very much forward to the next book in the series .
mom , 10 year old , and 12 year old really enjoyed the story and have begun wanting to read every book in the series .

great book . would recommend it to any one who likes suspense novels . ca n't wait to start another of her books .
this was actually a very good read . it could use more editing and english is probably not the author 's first language . i am always trying to find books like this .
awesome side story to bring the main story to light . not many times are answers given to why was it there or what happened to them ... .a mystery to a mystery sort of way
this book is a hit . i thoroughly enjoyed it . the plot was riveting and the characters very interesting as well as varied on personally . i will definitely read more by this is author if possible .

a good love story a good read for adults who are in to the series recommend highly so much is true it happens ever day
bravo ! ! ! what a great follow up to the first book ! ! ! i loved to watch how all the characters played out and how it all affected them ! !
this was just adding a bit to the first story line , and intersting from another point of view and no porn ,
a very beautifully done guide . like all such guides it is a touch hit or miss in some aspects , but it is very beautifully done . good information on the walk though .
the story was very good . it was about friendship , slightly about romance , and had a bit of suspense . the typos and lack of editing was extremely annoying on an otherwise good book .
loved it , not what i 've expected after two friends recommended me to read , it 's funny , sad , heartbreaking and romantic . with the rest .
this is a great start to an awesome book , but i want an ending ! ! ! ! ! ! are all the other books in this series the same way ? ? ? : (
get to know the cast of characters in this small town through the colorful narrative of ms. good . the drama unfolds into an unexpected climax , overall an entertaining read .
this one was not as funny as his other books . i would almost skip this one .
a wonderful love story that keeps you guessing right up to the end . ca n't wait for the next in the series . read it and you 'll love it too !
action packed from the beginning - well written with a great plot easy to follow - a book i could n't put down .
strange but funny book , they sure got into trouble with their walking dead it was so much fun to read it on kindle .
another alex cross detective novel . not bad , but not as good as some of the other books with this main character .
people who have read el james series , sylvia day series will like this book . it was ok for the most part .
book is interesting but seems to me to try to sell her other stuff rather than just providing information . i would read this book again just for the detail i want .
have not read this one yet either , but really love the series , the author , and the characters . so much fun .
i love steve martin , but this book was not especially funny or clever , like i have come to expect from him .
a relaxing and inspiring read with a mystery & some human drama mixed in . keeps you reading to the very end absolutely loved it !

this book was wonderful . i really got into the characters . the storyline kept me glued . i did n't want to put it down . i ca n't wait for the next book to come out : )
i did not like this book . i thought it was poorly written . it was to fast paced with the characters falling in love after one scene together . i will not read any more from this author .

omg i can not put the book down its so good . black ice really is a evil man the stuff he do and the way he think is really crazy glad it 's only a book .
i had high hopes for this , but all it gives is general guidelines that i could have just as easily gotten anywhere else for free .
the book to me was sort of like it was then and now . i skip a lot of pages but it ended right hope the next book is better
this book has a great cast of characters , and a story line with a little different twist to the zombie genre !
the pictures in this book are wonderful . they really bring the poem to life . my children are older , 8 and 11 , so i bought the book for me , but my kids loved it too .
this book has many if not all sherlock holmes stories in one place and it is free , what is there not to like ?
although some parts are difficult to read , a picture is painted of broken people with strength that few ever see . so much better than shades of grey !
if you are a parent , you need this book ! ! ! you will not regret it and you will never need another parenting book ever .
i enjoyed this book . so many romance novels fall short by being only a romance with very little story . this was a pleasant surprise with some mystery and many twists and turns .
great book . a must read could not wait for the next installment . love is worth it no matter the age .
everything you want to know and more . it is full of details a person needs to know . this book is very informative .
all of these books in this series are a quick easy read and if you read them and get hooked
loved it even though is was not what i thought it was going to be . but it went with the series .
what a great christian fiction book that deals with everyday things we go through and serious things ! i ca n't wait to read the rest of the series !
i liked the story line but would have rather it been drawn out and more detailed . i think it would have been better in several books .
this book was boring and weird and it did not keep my attention . i kept putting it down and then finally gave up . i was bored
very good to carry with you on the go and waiting at an office , work , visiting or gift to a friend , or before you go to bed .
downloaded this to my kindle . would love to write a book and maybe will someday with this handy how to .

lots of grammatical errors in this story and choppy writing . it has the foundation for being a good book but it just is n't quite there yet .
i had difficulty getting into this book and found it a little tedious . maybe it was just the subject matter which i did n't find interesting .

i read all three and while the story line was well wrapped up with left me wanting little , i still want to continue reading about these characters .
in just a short sentence this book makes you think of things you never thought of before or look at things in a different light .

a fast paced book that allows the reader to be part of the story as the main character finds the answers to her own problems while catching the `` bad guy '' .

like to have a strong heroine and sharing that something still needed to be overcome . i will read the next book .
you might not forget , but forgive because if you do n't it will eat at you . so to move pass that always forgive .
waste of money , did n't like it at all and did n't help me either . not at all worth the money or time .

i am a fan of a number of jillian hart 's serial works and look forward to the next installment of this series .
each book in this series draws the reader into the story . i recommend all books in this series . it does n't get any hotter !
usually a big fan of the author but felt this book needed a kick . yes , it was a romance and thriller but a lite version of each .
great stuff ! it left me wanting more . i hope there is a sequel in the future , because it left me wanting more . there is so much more to be written on this subject .
this is a well written book but i was truly looking for more illustrations to give me the desire to try this craft .

a bunch of naughty short modern twist on fairy tales . what else could be better ? nothing in my book . i hope there will be more of them .

as usual david baldacci keeps you turning the pages , since he builds up so much suspense . i love the way he writes , and the king and maxwell series is to me the best if his books .
i have read and enjoyed all seven books of the evans family series , but this one was by far my favorite .
very unique story with a very solid foundation . . . i can not wait to start the next book putting a unique spin in the fantasy genre is not easily done

i am not much for writing reviews let alone writing more then a few words so i liked it . love my p & p books
i got this to support a local professor . it was a pretty good read . it was a little graphic but i dig it
this is a great start to the series . it 's an easy read and a good story that keeps your attention . some of the story line was a little long , but overall pretty decent .
the storyline held my attention from start to finish which shows it was not only exciting but thoroughly enjoyable . i recommend this to all sandra brown 's fans .
sweet love story about a man women can only dream about . maybe a man exist like this . point is its a story about love and acceptance and i enjoyed it .
very engaging and the characters are rich in personality . the mystery is full of twists and holds you till the end . i loved it !
easy to see where this was going . gross ! not up to the quality of scare i have come to respect from my boy .
well written book ! great story line ! cant wait for part 2. one of the 1st books in months that did n't have a million typos .
the brothers are great ! wish i had my very own . ca n't wait for the next one to see what happens next
many years ago i fell in love at first sight . it did n't work out and i married someone else . this story had parts that took me back to that time . how sad .

like returning to an old friend . this is the kind of stories we enjoy from mr. smith .
once again , these series of magic books were absolutely delightful . i am so glad i bought them all and enjoyed every one of them .
continuation of a very good series that was hard to put down . my husband also enjoyed reading it . very good
i read about 2 chapters and was bored out of my mind . i do n't think it is hilarious at all .
was very interesting with a lot of good points . good historical novel . enjoyed the relationship between the two main characters and how it grew .
i love how the story is seen from the dog 's point of view and includes the funny quirky attitude of a clever dog brain .
very good at describing the oregon and a great mystery with a lot of surprises and a different kind of ending
this is a nice deck , although some of the changes made were a little odd . i 'd recommend it to a tarot collector or somebody interested in manga .
it 's simple enough to understand as a beginner but has lots of good advise for long practice ! thanks for writing this !
it a good book . only draw back is it is based on a vision of a person . i thought it was factual . but still very readable material .
i wish it did not take them so long to get together . i will read more of her books this is a first for me .
i really enjoyed this book , and the series itself . i recommended this to a avid reader friend and she enjoyed as well .
another useless book . these patterns are awful . the pictures show the finished project but the projects look like they were done by someone new to crochet .
great book but ending spoiled the whole thing . read it all eagerly and was very disappointed in what the author did , almost as if he got tired of writing and just wanted to end it
i enjoyed this book but would n't put it high on my list . really hard to believe that this guy could let his girlfriend try and kill herself without actually trying to help her .
this book was very interesting . not that my life or your life would ever go like this ( unrealistic ) , but the growth of the real relationship and the sex were definitely worth the read !
interesting book . the way it is written makes reading about history fun and certainly is educational . well done by the author .
very suspenseful , but some of the plot seemed less credible than his earlier books in the series . it kept my attention and the ending was a surprise . great dialogue .
this was a good book . i liked the heroine . she was sassy , smart , and funny . i am looking forward to reading more of this authors work .
christopher smith never disappoints . this was another incredible read ! he is truly an incredible writer . once again , i could n't put the book down .
i cant get enough of gabriel he is hot sexy smart . i love this story i 've read it 3 times
i love this series all the books are great have continued story of love . and lost . ca n't wait to read the final book .
these books were pretty good . i 'm interested to see what happens in the next book of the series . each book was a little short but that was my only big complaint .
been a great deal of time since i finished this book , but it was a good one , just a shame it was n't a great deal longer .
i found this book very hard to take . but , at the same time i could not stop reading to see what happened .
my granddaughters love this book . they are always looking for something to read when they visit and this book is very entertaining to them
just as i expected ... .this was an awesome book . i could n't put it down and hated to see it end . just awesome !
i am reading the other book first , but this one seems very interesting too . i will write another review when i finish this book .
some great stories . short and to the point . makes you think . what 's nice is they 're short and easy to read .
a humorous romp ! i 'm a little too old for all the details , but could recommend this to those 40 and younger . and it gives a little food for thought by the end .
i am using this bible as my devotional scripture each morning and having the verse explanations on each chapter is very helpful .
a must read to any one who liked the titanic movie . well written and a good story . well documented story
this series continues to get hotter with every book . the characters and story develop as you continue the series . on to book 7 .
read the whole series . enjoyed the characters . enjoyed the story . wanted to see how it would all end . would recommend to anyone
all i can say is i enjoyed this book . although i did n't like the back and forth chapters it is still a great book .
nothing too special about this one . ok if you just want something to read that is n't going to get you hooked . predictable with not much of a plot .
this is a dark heavy novel . but i did love it . you are never sure exactly where it is going with lots of twist and changes .
good book , enjoyed reading it . easy read book . great story line . it was a long time coming for her sometime you have to protect that heart .
a gift for my sister . she seems to really like it and has pulled a lot of recipes from it .
i kind of liked the plot of the story and it seemed to come together at the end . however the punctuation and dialogue really bothered me . let 's just say that this book needs one more editor .
great book ! loved story - and military plot intertwined - would recommend to anyone ! great story & suspense in book
i liked this author and the characters a lot . it 's similar to the dark hunter series except its set in the past .
i have very much enjoyed ready this series . i 'll be sure to check out more from this author . these books would make very good movies .
i really enjoyed this collection of books . you will laugh and cry . they show that love happens when you do n't expect it . they are short stories , but they all build on each other .
this book is easy to read and contains easy step-by-step project with pictures as well as written directions . the variety of projects goes from very easy to more difficult .

this book started off great & i really enjoyed it the first few chapters . i did n't like the monster storyline & almost stopped reading but i wanted to see what happened at the end .
oh my gosh ! definitely as good as the first one . a few twists and turns that i was n't expecting . and the best part is there is no cliffhanger ! excellent story .
loved the story . gripping right to the end . now looking for next episode and more books by the author .
the book is better than the last two volumes but too many questions still exists . mr. blake has definitely left his options opened for further volumes .
this is an interesting account of a major scientific problem and its solution , which is almost all but forgotten today . if you enjoy the history of science , you will probably like this book .
good story and very well written . grabbed my attention and held it . i would recommend this book to anyone who likes mysteries .
this series blew me away ! once i started reading i couldnt put it down . i read all three books in 3 days ! if you love vampire type books give this one a shot !
really good book , i loved the topic ... it really leaves you thinking ... & # 34 ; what if ... & # 34 ; great book , do n't hesitate to buy it and read it !
this book is great for any one that has kids or works with children of any age . a wonderful resource .
i 'm sorry i wasted my time reading this . it 's like a bad short story written by a junior high kid . took everything ok had to finish it to write a review .
this is a book for young girls to read . i think they would really enjoy it but it was n't for me .
i found many apps that i did n't know about through this book and i 've bought several books and this one is definitely the best one .
always enjoyed nora robert 's books , so this one by ava miles was really good . i think she named about all the characters from nora ' s books . will read more of her books .
i have just finish reading this book and it had its moments but i most say i really enjoy the book now about to look for innocence
this is a very cute story . definitely a different kind of cinderella story . i would like to read more by this author .
such a sweet story . i was n't expecting the outcome to be bittersweet but i 'm glad it ended the way it did . what a roller coaster of emotions . great read !
slow start but when it finally got to the meat of the story , i really enjoyed it . love the characters and looking forward to the next story .
this book draws you in quickly and does not let go . i am now addicted to anything this author writes and have yet to be let down .
you 'll enjoy watching these women grow as they come to understand themselves . seemingly lost , they all come to understand themselves and move forward .
all of these books in this series have enjoyable characters and are fast reads . i always wish it was n't over -- ca n't wait until the next one comes out .
i got these books for my grandchildren , but have looked at them myself and learned things i did n't know . an excellent series .
lots of twists and turns . was not at all what i was expecting but still a great read . would recommend to others !
a very easy to read book with realistic characters , the contents of the story are about love , marriage , anger and divorce , but also about understanding yourself .
great story line but there are way too many words to get to point . just lost interest and skimmed through it .
i love romance novels that end as this one does . i like the characters also . a good read ! a good ending .
this is another in the series , the book was good i would recommend it . you should get the whole series at once & save .
this book is so intriguing you ca n't put it down . i did n't want to finish reading this as it was was good . got to read this .
omg i can not get enough of these too i can not wait until the next one comes out it is amazing
i like this book because it has lots of good recipes that are wonderful ! it is fun to make them as well ! ; )
wonderful help . this is a great reference book for everyone to have on their shelf .
good plot , nice premise ... but main character a bit over done therefore gets a bit tedious at times . other characters well defined .
i 'm not sure my teen is going to get into this ... but it would be good for him ! hope i can get him to try it .
great story line . i really enjoyed this book . the author pulls you into the characters . scary thing , this could happen .
from the description of what she wrote it sound good until i read it all . i will at this time give it a 3
i did not like this book it was too convoluted s storyline and had too many subplots . it was totally unbelievable .
i loved the book even though it broke me . she writes real life situations and the affects . it is definitely worth reading !
unbelievable story line , characters were childish , & the book not well written . i wo n't be reading another book by this author for awhile .
i really like the way she has with words . i laugh , cry , get scared and want more loving . when is the next book out ?
love that it so descriptive and seemingly accurate for as much as i know . the characters are developed and mature amazingly well
i could read this book over and over , its amazing ! it made cry , laugh , oh , it was brilliant ! ill never forget it .
good book , enjoyed reading . this was not her greatest , but i always like her writing as she always has a great ending
okay book worth looking at . i do n't think it was the best to purchase , although it did offer some good ideas .
great old pictures . makes a good gift . really good book to sat at the table and read with someone else
my brother actually went to the same school she went to , witch is actually really different than described in the book , but it 's so so good ! and so is the movie .
it was a little depressing and not enough resolution of the problem the plot was weaving ... but it was good enough to want to read more by todd
if you are a looking for a satisfying , light mystery that will keep you guessing , this is the book . very enjoyable , looking forward to other garwood books .
as with all victoria books , this one is attention getting and keeping . plan to re-read in the future . it 's a keeper for my library .
all of these seals coming out have the same feel . i would have loved it if i had n't already read the same thing 3 times .
this is the fifth novel that i 've read from this author . however , this is the first book in a new series . i 'm looking forward to the next release .
a very compelling and excellent conclusion to the series . there 's a nasty event at the end that even surprised me .
love this author . i ca n't wait for the next book in the series . i love the story and the characters , both are so well developed and captivating .
loved this book , worth a read especially for you native american romance lovers out there like myself . you wo n't be disappointed .
great book . just wish it was longer ( i know not really something to review about this book ) . very entertaining .

i have seriously enjoyed this series . the writing really holds your interest . i usually read these books in a day or two because they are so interesting .
this novel was a well written book . it keeps you in suspense until the end . it was hard to put down .
i really enjoyed the suspense of this book . the characters were believable as was the plot . i would suggest anyone who likes crime novels to give this a read .
this was a gift given to someone else . the person . to be very happy with this and has recommended it to others to read .
a good read with easy to like characters , the only down side is that with any shorter story , there is not a lot of time for too much detail . enjoyable .
i purchased three bird books and this is my favorite . i would highly recommend it . it gives great pictures and a lot of information .
this book was well written and very funny . i had a hard time putting my ipad down after i started reading it because it kept me interested at every turn of the page .
the relationship between erin and mate is hot hot hot . a great sequel to the previous books . i am waiting for the last installment .
i loved this book ! i ca n't wait to read the next three ! it kept me reading into to the wee hours of the morning .
there is not enough words to say how much i love kristen ashley and all of her books . i need her in my life
great story still trying to figure out who what when good or bad guy can not wait for the next book in series
i liked & # 34 ; and she was & # 34 ; because the twists and turns just kept coming ! it was very hard to put down !
i actually enjoy these as quick reads . what i miss is making the characters more than they were last time . maybe next time .
i had trouble finishing it . just the troubled times was too depressing for me .
it was a little too bloody for me . i was n't happy with the main character he was way out there
my 2 year old grandson enjoys the this and other curious george stories . he would like to have them all .
i really enjoyed reading this book . very interesting and found it hard to put down . i would pass it along to a friend .
loved how the characters were developed and book unfolded . a great read about some very caring people . i 'll definitely read more by this author .
i love the virgin river series books . i hope that robyn carr continues writing more on this series ! i definitely suggest reading all the virgin river books .
real friends to the end no matter what . most have not learned what it is to be real . i 've read this book 3 times . keep doing what you do .
the book was good , but you are really left with the feeling there is more to come , not sure when that will be but anytime will be most welcome : - )
this is the best book of this genre i 've read in ages ! the story and characters make me want to be there ! enjoy !
i read this on spring break and laughed the whole time . my kids thought i was crazy . i really enjoyed seeing that i was not alone . : )
do n't know what it was but this book was very difficult to get into . i returned it right away . perhaps i missed something ...
david baldacci just ca n't write these fast enough for me ! what a great read ! ! i could put it down ... again !
good read you did a good job on t his story ... i love the fact that it always something going on ...
this book was exceptional , i could n't put it down and i never laughed so hard , i ca n't wait for the next one .
loved the characters and a very touching story . i would definitely recommend this book to anyone who likes a sweet story and a quick read .
i really enjoy this author 's writing style . i have read several of her books , and they never disappoint me ! ca n't wait to read her next book !
i loved this book and the whole series . it was a beautiful story an kept my attention and interest through every page . it would make an wonderful movie .
loved this book ; would recommend it to everyone ! just as other books are still excellent , this book is just as much a pleasure .
read this before you see any of the movies made . i feel like it 's much better and more informative than what they show in the movies .
great book . good buy for any sales professional who has to use the phone at work .
as always i love a fool 's gold story . this one was n't the best but was still a fun read . i enjoyed it .
not a fan of this one ... storyline just was n't very believeable , seemed like the author just threw in dramatic things to try and shock people . did n't buy it .
i was intrigued by the subject matter . the book was so interesting i could not stop reading it until i found out what happened to this family .
info was up to date . format was very good , which made the subject matter easy to understand . i would recommend this book .
it was interesting to go back to a style of writing not used today . it is a side of dickens i had not read before .
great book she always has great recipes and easy to prepare , my favorite chef , she never disappoints . i have several of her cook books and recipes always come out as planned
i was sad when i was done reading this trilogy . i 'm thinking we need more strong woman in today 's stories .
a good read and a lot of details to keep up with . particularly as the characters that lead change frequently . fairly difficult to keep up with .
this one was a little different and loved it . i am reading all of her alphabet books but none of the others
i read this book first by accident , and then rushed to read the others in the series ! loved them all !
interesting ideas , written rather well ; to me , more horror than science fiction , but it had both . a dystopian future , indeed .
this book was a page turner . i did not want it to end . i thought the description of life before and during wwii was excellent . highly recommend it for lovers of novels set in this era .
loved the book hope there are more , it is funny and exciting . the only problem is it is to short i really get into it and it us over .
this is great ! i was looking for all the things you can do with a chicken . this book has it all .
i really enjoyed the hunger games trilogy . do not get to read as much as i would like . looking forward to more by suzanne collins .
i really can not decide which book i love the most they were all so well written ! there is no way for me to pick and i mean that of all marie books
i liked this story very much , it has lots of suspense , it is original and keeps you interested on the reading . the characters are well chosen and balanced
a decent book but incomplete . i ca n't help but notice the book is incomplete , which is disappointing at best but what was there was a okay enough book
it was hard to put this one down . i caught myself cheering and getting mad all at once . ready for the next book .
this book presents a challenge to those of us who write things of as `` new age '' and ignore it . maybe science and extraordinary knowing can go together .
it was so good , i could n't put it down . it reminds me of my husband and i. read it one day .
formatting is bad . the pictures are very small and text is set outside of pictures . this is a picture book originally , but it does n't feel like one in this format .
great book and especially so for the horse lover ! will buy any new books in the series . well written and entertaining .
i got the first book free on my kindle , and had to read the rest of the series ! they were terrific ! best books i 've read in a long time !
ca n't wait for the third book to come out . really sad about the fire and the awake . but everything worked out .
the story started almost as two different plots but they came together nicely . by the end i could not put down the book . looking forward to next book .
i only regret that they do not have the word origins of each word , yet other than that it is great .
love the series and could n't wait for this book to come out . did not end how i had expected , but i was unable to put it down .
like the title says typical john locke and that 's a good thing . he still knows how to make an addictive book . its hard to stop reading once you start .
really enjoyed this book , going to start the next one right away . i would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good mystery or adventure with a little supernatural thrown in .
i did n't really like the main character and felt the plot was contrived , but it did keep you hanging until the end of the book .
i love the genre and chris is a master of it . this is a page-turner that will keep you up all night long !
this is not a kind of book that you can not put down but okay if you are looking for some entertainment .
very entertaining book to read . well written and thought out . i would recommend this to anyone interested in mystery and suspence novels .
have not read this book for years . nice christmas story that brings back the feeling of christmas and what it so all about .
it was a little drawn out . but it once again will have me buying the next book to see what happens
i got caught up in this book quickly and enjoyed it very much . looked forward to each book of the series .
it was good but jumped around from one plot to another . it was hard to keep track of at times .
very well written , very touching . it 's a story you can get lost in . every thing does have a purpose in life , this story will touch you .
there are many great erotic books written . but sadly this is not one of them . enough to put you to sleep counting the spelling and grammar errors .
i loved this book and thought it was an amazing sequel to the first book and i ca n't write anymore i have to read then act one
this one was ok , not my favorite . the ones set in more modern seem to give the author greater scope to be amusing .
i love , love , love this series . i ca n't wait until the other book comes out soon . hard to put down .
i enjoyed this book which i purchased through amazon so much that i have bought it for others . for myself i always get the used copies and have never been disappointed but , i buy new for gifts .
i could not complain . this book kept me 24 hours awake . i am glad that i gave it a chance . unusual plot . looking forward for next one .
i found it an easy read , if not a little predictable . not sure if i would go for something else by the same author .
as i mentioned on & # 34 ; no two alike & # 34 ; , the author definitely knows her subject but it overly wordy and impressed with herself as something of a mystery writer .
in this book the author covers nine common fears and show how through faith in god one can overcome their fears .
like 80 % of the recipes . looking forward to trying a lot of different recipes . i hope i can cook as well as my mom did .
it is well writen for the lay person , as myself . i bought it for research in developing fiction characters mind sets and found it very interesting reading
sweet , entertaining , short and easy to read . found it by chance and now have to read the next one and the first one .
i love this series ! ! they are super short but still a great a read ! i hope the series is finished quickly
have read the majority of her books . i await the release of her new books so that i can review and purchase them .
cute book for kids . teaches them a lesson on listening to their parents and when to trust someone . recommended for various ages .
in my opinion this is the best study bible available . i understand the translation is very good and i like the layout of this bible better than any of the other ones i 've seen .
i thought this was a well-written book , but i found it disappointing that the characters did not interest me very much . i could n't really relate to them ... they were just not very likable in general .
i have never read a jack reacher story i did n't like . i wish lee could write faster . i am anxious for the next one .
it was not a book that i could not put down . however , it was a book i looked forward to getting back to and i could really picture all the characters in the book .
this is one of those books where the author actually manages to go beyond the level of his original book and drag the reader in even deeper . an awesome zombie novel by a talented author .
almost wish i needed this bar but definitely need a drink after reading this ! loved this book and felt like i was a part of the story ... wished i had been .
great and funny , cute book . it 's a fast read really holds your attention something on the light side books.i would recommend this book to anyone who loves a fast read
very good ; funny ; enjoyed it . brenda is a very good writer ; i would recommend her book to all my friends
love , abuse , time , and courage all wrapped up in this friendship story that still leaves you waiting for a happily ever after in the second book !
if your into vampire short novels . great read and had twist and turns in them . hot and sexy all around .
i have been disappoint ed in many of patterson 's recent books but not this one . it was up to his old standards . it was a good read .
i certainly enjoyed this book . this is my first book by this author and i ca n't wait to start the next . always looking for someone new to read .
i could not put this book down even if i tried . it was so intense and kept me wanting to know what happens .
i liked it and this is what i have come to expect from a grisham novel . fast paced , fun , exciting and great read for the beach or train .
i enjoyed it very much . it 's from my era and i could identify with a lot of it . characters were very well drawn .
riveting . two good story lines . a classic patterson thriller in every sense of the word . makes alex cross more human .
this is a great book that moves quickly and has excellent dialogue . i do n't know what those other folks are seeing , but this is a great read .
cowboy dad was a amazing read ! this story was so romantic it made me feel like i was actually in the story
if we all had values and looked at each other as these two soldiers did , we would n't have any wars .
i bought 2 of this book for each of my son 's grandma 's . these stories definitely make you laugh and cry . i am big fan of chicken soup books and own several myself .
i liked the ending . not a big twist but the ending was dark . easy read . i got it when it was on sale for 99 cents . perfect at that price .
suzanne has an exceptional imagination to come up with a story as intriguing as the hunger games . all 3 books were incredible , but the last was perhaps my favorite . the ending : exceptional !
3rd in sequel ... now i am hooked on the story and it is sad and wonderful . highly recommend it for entertaining reading .
could not put it down ! amazing read ! i love the characters and ca n't wait for the next one ! ! as always an enjoy to read !
great story , keep me reading and i finished in two days ! this book was better then some that i 've paid for !

i have this book in paperback , hard cover & it only made sense to have it on may kindle i have read it three times so far
love this rowling is a writer with a lot to say . i look forward to seeing what she does next .
this book is an easy read . it 's premise is interesting , however , some of it 's content is predictable and far fetched .
great book , filled with different age groups of heads and hands and clear instructions on many things concerning these body parts ! ! it was my christmas present to myself ! ! ! ! ! ! !
good but too short finished in half a day , but i 'm looking forward to the next book - which i 'm starting right now . sure hope it 's longer
just loving all of the percy jackson series ! such fun & entertainment & learning about greek mythology is a bonus !
honestly this book keeps you connected all the time , you ca n't stop reading , wow with the imagination of this author
this book was great and i hope they write a sequel . this is a book for people who like magic . i highly reccomend it to anyone .
without pictures i could n't imagine what she was saying . most hints sounded like junk . i guess if you were very creative you could make them work .
this book was just ok for me . not a big fan of how it ended , but enjoyed the majority of the book until that point . this was a book club selection .
enjoyed the book . could relate to her stories since i also lived in a country in africa when i had small children .
this was a great book . a dystopian fiction that is a lot like hunger games . i great read . i definitely recommend it .
another cross novel that did not disappoint . fast moving and easy reading . i will continue to read his books in the future .
this was a great book . the story line was excellent and the writing style made the story fun to read . this is one i did not want to put down
the wolf within was a good read but it was n't the kind of book that i like to read at the moment
another great book about this family . enjoy nora roberts novels and she does n't disappoint with this one . fast , easy read .
it was a good book . characters and editing were good . wish it was a little longer . otherwise a good book .
if you like a good read , you 've got it . love the dog she drags around . if you like an amusing read you 've got it .
i liked this book . great story and good writing . i just wish the author did n't rush the ending . i think she could have drawn it out a little bit longer . but sexy read nevertheless .
i liked sometimes never but i loved before now . park was nothing to me in the first book but i fell in love with him and lucy in this one . they are beautiful .
this book series is good and entertaining for children and adults alike . if you like history or your kids do this series can be great for them .
read all of them just because once i start a book i read them all . never do it again ever
another excellent read by sandra brown . very good story line and exciting finish ! ! mrs. brown is such a good writer , always entertaining .
lost a few nights of sleep on this one . koontz does it again .
i thought this would be a good book but i was disappointed . it was slow and didnt pull the story together . it always seems to be confused . i finished it , but would not recommend it .
enjoyed all of the last chance series . do n't believe that this held up to the standard of prior one but is still a good read .
awesome book ! i also bought one for my husband who is in afghanistan right now . we both loved the book .
found it very helpful and interesting , informative . good read . contains information about apps that is helpful in making a decision on whether or not to choose the app .
a friend gave me this book and i loved it . loaned it to several people and never got it back so had to order my own copy to keep .
nice alternate to the typical plot . a different mr. darcy but i liked his style . the book kept me interested
liked the book . very good character and setting description and moved along at a good pace . had not read grisham in awhile and enjoyed reading one of his books again .
this book kept my interest enough to finish it , but probably would n't re-read . may try other books by same author though .
this book is a little corny , but we could definitely all use a little corny in our lives . worth the time to read !
the book arrived in standard time and in new condition . i have n't started reading it yet but i did take a peek and it seems to have what i was looking for .
wonderful writing style , felt the pull of desire to make it work and the difficulty of commitment . loved reading about the cooking !
i could not put this book down . very exciting , suspenseful , always keeping you guessing . the hot attraction between anne an michael is amazing . loved it ! ! ! !
if your the fantasy reader this is the book for you . daniel keeps you wanting more . thank you for giving us more
i have only read the first couple of chapters of this book and it is very uplifting and positive . would definitely recommend if you need a pick me up . this is great .
i loved the story . it was little too short for me though . i am looking forward to others in thus series . i just hope they will be longer .
i have read all the other books in this series , and i am not impressed with this book . it was too rushed and unbelievable .
i enjoyed the book it kept me busy for the whole time i read it look forward to the next one
i use this devotional daily and it always speaks to my current need . now , how does it do that ? ? ? ? i love it .
if you are a fan of vince flynn then you must read this one , actually very hard to put down
okay for a light read , especially if historical settings are your thing . decent plotting , scene construction and fairly strong characters .
one of the best books i 've read all year . ms. gross pulled me into the story , and i could n't let go until i finished the last word .
i have no argument with the information in the book but it was difficult to read because it was very poorly written .
i have read this book several times . and it 's still a good story . every body this is a good way to think before jumping in bed with a new person .
i love all of james lee burke books ok im done and i will order other books if i am ever giving a final on this stupid review
i have always enjoyed max brand 's work . this book was very well written and kept me interested . i plan to read all of max brand 's work .
really enjoyable scifi romp . great first attempt - much better than some scifi authors writing for years ! looking forward to the sequels .
as i usually read period romances , this was a good switch over . i enjoyed it and it was a fun read .
good story . it had me on the edge through out the book . not completely predictable which i like . a good read !
the directions are clear and easy to follow and the patterns are a delightful challenge to knit , children love them .
enjoyable read , kept my interest throughout the story . memorable characters and a good plot left me wanting more of the story .
it 's been a while since i read this , but i could not put it down . good character descriptions and fast moving plot .
i am sure that when this book came out , it was probably mind blowing . i did find it entertaining , but not enough to recommend to others .
i enjoyed all of the train through time books and look forward to reading more by this author . love time travel books .
this is a wonderful book . i have german blood and wanted to know more about germany . i found this book very informative and very readable . i would highly recommend this book to anyone .
it 's okay for a short read i did expect a lot more from it though the story line was n't that great and there did n't seem to have much substance , but all in all not real bad
nothing really great about this book but nothing really bad either . short and a bit of a twist at the end .
this was a gift for a new , first time mother , and i hope she uses this as a reference book --
i loved this one just as much as the first one i ca n't wait for the third book . absolutely amazing 5 stars .
this book kept you on the edge of your seat . it is a good read and worth the time to buy it and read it . it is great .
very very good i enjoyed and ca n't wait for part two ! keeps you pulled in the who time ... great great
this book is the bomb . i needed to learn how to make my own products fast and i love this book . i would recommend it to anyone .
i loved getting into ethan 's head . definitely a series worth reading and this is a real treat . go read them now !
the best western series i 've read in a long time . it 's almost like being there . i often refer to the maps and imagine what they must have gone thru .
only offers advice if you are interested in getting into internet marketing . i dropped it about half way through . not for everybody .
the plot is good and well me and my husband have had alot more sex and trying new things in bed
great writing and good twists along the way . character building was not as good as some others but still kept the interest
i really have enjoyed this series and even own all the books ! while this was a very interesting story , it was n't my favorite . still , totally worth reading : )
there was n't enough storyline to get me invested in the characters or care what happened . this would be the perfect script for a porn through , just everybody having sex and no depth .
this book is interesting from beginning to the end . a female president and her husband a private i. i am now reading the second book in the series .
this latest john sandford was a great read . it was fast paced & interesting . i can not wait for his next book !
a good read ! it kept me engage from beginning to end . i know it better be a part two . definitely a page turner .
i am looking forward to reading another it is a summer read that does not need a lot of brain power
i really enjoyed all of it ... . ready to read the next book ... hoping brooke and elizabeth will become mates ! !
a short story with love and trust issues . if you 're able to get past the past and move forward life can be like it should be . it 's too the point and well written .
very well written . great & # 34 ; word pictures & # 34 ; . reader feels involved in the action . creates a real feeling of the situations of all the characters .
i was surprised that i enjoyed this as much as i did . it had a nice flow and good plotting and was quite a believable take on the ancient aliens theme .
this was a short story with little excitement . i would like to see a longer story made out of it
received this order in a timely fashion . ca n't wait to start reading the book .
this book was kind of immature to me . i dont think the characters were developed well . wish i would have borrowed this one ...
this novel was a page turner . highly recommend reading as it kept your interest . would like to read more of author 's novels
i got this to take a break in my heavy reading . it 's got some action and it well research like all of brown 's works . it does get a little boring .
sweet book just what i expect from this author . follows the series well and good at introducing the new characters love it
very exciting . this fighter pilot gave his all for what he believed in , as a product of that time . it was his call to do so .
a very good book . this is a series i can get into and am be looking forward to reading more of this series .
i loved it . wondering what is going on , watching and waiting . you always feel emotion with her characters . i was left wishing there was more to it .
very readable . story line was well thought out . the main character is very likable . over all i enjoyed it .
i can always count on bella to provide a sexy and heartwarming read and this book is no exception . i ca n't wait to read the next sullivan book .
i could n't out it down ! i pray that the women of all countries will be free and equal in my lifetime !
this book was awesome . dark and hot ! ! loved it . i would like to read more by this author . i could n't put it down .
i absolutely love this song book . easy to play and has many contemporary christian songs that i adore .
very good story plot . i did not want to put the book down once i started reading . mr. patterson you are great at keeping the suspense level high . keep up the wonderful story telling
did n't really hold my attention . i need more words for this , i do n't know . i did n't care for it , it 's free so give it a shot .
this book is such a good read . it speaks to the hearts of each of us and brings out in us the desire to do more for each other and to listen more to god .
this book had me turning pages . great california history overview , drama , romance . i am eager to start other books by this author .
it was a good book but i like to know what happens to the end of the end of the book
i loved this short erotica . it 's steamy hot . i will definitely be checking back in to see what happens with the couple .
very good , concise discussion . very interesting information if you 're using more than one version of the bible , which i 've done as a writer of religious education for children .
i am a long time sherlock holmes fan ; it 's nice to hear it instead of reading it , and the reading was well done .
much darker than some of the other books in this series . i personally do not understand why this author is not more well known
the book is quick ; holds your interest ; it 's a page turner . also , you learn a little about the amish and their traditions .
i enjoyed it . kept my attention and could not wait to get to the end . i find his books easy to follow .
i think this story moved too slow . i just was n't into it . maybe i did n't read into it far enough , but i expected more .
the beginning started off slow to me but that is because i was already aware of most of the information he presented . it picks up in the middle .
this series does not disappoint . i liked the development of then characters and appreciated their struggles for life and freedom .
really cute and funny . great writing but wish there had been a little more conflict at the end . love this author
an excellent guide covering most of what you need to know . i certainly would be purchasing more guides from this author .
great resource . i love the way she presented her ideas regarding healthy living . and as always , the recipes are phenomenal .
i loved this book and look forward to reading about the other brothers . hopefully i find them before i forget this one .
i am building a home library and i thought this book would be an excellent addition . the book arrived in perfect condition .
this book was very cute and very relatable ! i think it would make a great father 's day gift for any star wars fan !
i was n't sure what i thought about this book once i realized what was going on . a surprising turn of events . a poignant personal story .
this is a gift for my son and he will not receive it until december so i have no idea how good it is .
suspense , all the way thru . had to keep reading , wanted to know what happens next . ca n't wait to start next book .
after reading the reviews , i was n't sure , but this was a really good book ! i could n't put it down . highly recommend .
i enjoyed this series more in the beginning and i am glad to have it end . i wanted to like this more but could n't get into it .
this book has a great lesson about the importance of moms but it is told in a funny way that kids will really understand . a winner of a kids book that comes highly recommended !

i really enjoyed both books in this series , ca n't wait for part 3. vampires meet dan brown . these books are not just for the ladies .
nice looking book but i did not care for any of the recipes in it.. big waste of money . don ; t buy this one .
i have a second grader who loves these books . he wants to read them to see what is going to happen next and i love that .
i loved this book . the story was a joy to read . i highly recommend it to all young adults and adults too . i shall pass on the word . perfect !
this book does n't even have an answer key ! what is the point of doing the exercises if you do n't even know if you 're right ? ? ?
brilliant . could n't put it down . the most enjoy read i 've had for a very long time . ca n't wait for the final instalment

kept me interested the whole book . did n't want to stop reading . all i can say us a definite zombie must read . great job mr . jake ! !
i can always count on evanovich 's novels as being a quick , entertaining read . lots of humor mixed in with stephanie plum 's unusual work .
bought this for a christmas present . i like it but i think there is better books out there . it was great that it came in a package of 4 .
the best i can say about any book is that i got invested in what happened with the characters . ca n't wait to read the next book .
wow i can hardly put it down . glad i 'm done so i can go to sleep instead of reading half the night .
i ca n't believe that i finished this book in one day i could not put it down i ca n't wait for the next one ! ! ! ! ! !
i got so lost in this story that it was hard to end it . the characters were so interesting that it was hard to stay away from my kindle .
stuart woods continues to amaze me in that he can keep our same loveable characters and continue to put them into new and interesting storylines . great read .
this book was incredible ! i loved it from the first page ! one of my top reads so far this year and i can not wait for the next one !
also found that the author talks mainly about plants he has personal experience with . he does suggest some other titles for different information and recipes .
there was some serious plot twists in this book that i was n't expecting ! i enjoyed it from start to finish !
wow this book kept me interesting from page one . i feel in love with the characters and felt their emotions i fell in love with cassie and jack and i felt a part of their life !
i liked it because it portrayed some christian values , i liked it because there was not explicit love scenes . it was not a page turner for me until the last two or three chapters

i 've just started reading military sf , and this seems a solid book ; enjoyed the characters and plot , and it kept me entertained throughout .
i really liked the story line . i like the way the story was crafted . it was real not fantasy or make believe . i could relate to the struggle the characters were facing .
nothing speaks romance better than pirates ! the pirate wolf series was very good and hope there are more books to follow in the future .
great book ! i do have to say that i enjoyed the others a bit more because they had at least a bit more going on and i would 've loved to see v what happened with leo ...
these books kept me on the edge of my seat at every page . the ending really surprised me , i could n't believe it .
love this book fell in love with the characters . from part 1. fell in love with them all over again in part 2 what can i say well done
i could read this series over and over . you fall in love with all the character as soon as you start reading . i did n't want the story to end .
entertaining , but not exceptionally good . one can easily guess the progression of the plot and the outcome . tension was average .
this series has me completely hooked and am waiting for the next book in the series as patient as i can
omg this book was wonderful . i cried so much . i could not put it down . so many ups and downs . now the second book needs to come out . read it in one day .

really enjoying the series . i really like to follow characters in mystery books and this is one to keep following .
loved this book . had no idea about this part of history . what a story ! what a part of american history !
if you just need a filler read until you next favorite book is published , this is it . the plot and characters need more development .
i loved the first one , i was hoping that the second would be just as good and it was . must read .
pretty much what you expect with a scottish romance but still fun and exciting drama with a twist at the end .
captures your interest with a good storyline . good characters . i 'll look for more from this author . was another page turner
this book was a bit slow for me but over all , it was a good read . was n't anything out of the ordinary .
this book was really hard to put down . it was full of suspense right to the end . i wish they could have caught the killer though .
there are too many characters . i ca n't keep track of all of them . the story moves fast , then seems to stop with again , too many characters .
this book held my attention all the way through . i wanted the book to continue . i can not wait to read the rest of the series .
more to the story than many romances . interesting secondary characters , as well as , main characters . i feel a sequel coming to this one .
my granddaughter loves books , and curious george is her absolute favorite ! these books are sturdy and colorful . the price is fair and the delivery prompt .
this is a wonderful book and such an inspiration for all beginning & # 34 ; fabric artists & # 34 ; . i highly recommend it to anyone interested in trying this .
the book was just fine . it was the sequel to the first book and i enjoyed it very much .
very sexy and romantic . very well written sex scenes and a great story line . i am going to miss the dynamics of these two characters .
this book held my interest . was a easy read . if i remember right it had no bad language . happy ending
i enjoyed this story very much ! it was sweet . it had sadness and trials but fun ! i killed . the it ended .

sometimes i read a series and then realize once i start the series i have to see it through , glad it is over

this diet book makes sense . it is written well . just follow their steps and the results will be there . it has worked for me .
i so enjoyed this series that i bought every book in the series . i just could not seem to get enough of the stories .
i have used this a lot , it is much more complete than the one i had before i would recommend it .
my son took this to camp with him two years ago . he actually still uses it . it 's sturdy and allows him to read in bed before falling asleep .
good story - especially if you are scared of vegetables ! cute story where vegetables are n't so scary in the end .
i enjoyed this book very much . i like to read a good mystery and this story held my attention to the very end .

i found some good ideas in this book . the details are helpful too . i recommend this to anybody wanting ideas .
the book is not for beginners . i know the game but wanted to improve my play . this book definitely helped .
i have read all 4 of & # 34 ; the witness & # 34 ; books and wish there were 10 more ! yes , she is that good !
this was a good novel and i would recommend it . i 'm looking forward to the next in the series . good effort and was glad to find editing and grammar were n't too bad .
funny and action packed . 5 stars , give it a read . and i am impressed by the creativity it took to make this book .
the story kept you going from the beginning to the end . a lot of interesting characters woven into the story .
interesting story line and it was a very nice slow romance that you hoped would happen . it does but also has a few surprises along the way .
enjoyable book that holds your interest right to the end . well written with good character development and plot . thought the ending would be predictable , but it was n't . somewhat strange twist .
you need to check this one out for the big ideas and the real people that this guy can weave .
a good mystery with a little bit of everything . action , romance , intrigue , adventure . not to keep you on the edge of your seat , but a quick read .
he has an interesting imagination and the plot twists and turns keep you on your toes . sometimes a bit graphic .
enjoyed this story about people and their relationships . this is the second book of hers i 've read and may read more
the story line was good , the characters not bad . the sex scenes were ok but not as good as i had hoped
i loved this book ! i actually think it was better than hopeless . the author did a great job telling his side of the story .
i read the first book and really liked it so bought the boxed set . a bit disappointed in the rest .
i am not finished with this book , but i always enjoy reading about famous historical people and events , this book has not disappointed me

this is not for the weak stomach but very insightful of what is happening in the world today . enjoyed the entire book .
i recently read loving frank and was glad i had or i would have been lost in this book . i learned a lot as i did not know anything of his personal life .
this book is awesome . i could n't put it down . it is the perfect love story . if you like lo e stories this should be at the top of your list to read .
i downloaded this book for free . it had a good story but the writing left a lot to be desired . very slow in places .
i found this to be a great book . when i first started to read i did not know where it was going to go . i was really pleased at how it developed and ended
i am really enjoying this series . i get to the end of the book and ca n't believe i have finished it . have to have the next one .
i could not put these books down . you feel like you are there . a wonderful love story . have read them over and over !
hoping for more detail . showed its age at times . yet still a classic w good timeless reminders of how best to spend one 's time .
could n't put it down , to good to even stop and eat until i devoured it all ! ca n't wait for the next one ! it ca n't come out any sooner !
get bargain and easy to use . i still listen to it even after passing the class . a wonderful resource and investment .
this was a lot of help for a lot of my questions but not all . the index is n't very helpful .
this was my favourite book as an eight or nine year old - it 's beautifully crafted . i was simply in heaven when my mother read this out loud ( much more exciting than reading it alone ) .
good story , a little slow , nothing real exciting happens , but it looks like the next one will have a hugh fight .
what an enjoyable romance ! the storyline is straightforward and at times a bit repetitive but the characters are strong so so easy to love and hate . i recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a nice romance .
this story was interesting enough to keep me reading . i was rooting for a happy ending for the heroine and was not disappointed ... .
i seem to write the same review for the same author . i like these characters and will continue to read them .
decent plot . i found it to be a little disjointed . nevertheless if you like lawyer and courtroom stories you will enjoy it .
well written . characters are well thought out . makes you wonder what you would want for both characters . be ready to cry
such a great series ! once i started the books i just could n't put them down . i read a book a day .
this is a very large book , and i just could n't put it down . i loved learning about her life . it was an amazing story .
this time we are off to another city for the newest mystery . we learn much more about the family and the era in which they lived . an interesting and fun read .
i really enjoyed rough man so was looking forward to brad taylor 's second book . unfortunately not as good but still decent read . drags at times . but still enjoy following the character line .
this book has so much helpful information . a wonderful resource to add to your book collection . great for the beginner or someone that 's been painting a long time .
i love christian fiction . this book shows how we can change once god becomes the front runner of our lives .
i thought the book was ok but the theme was very predictable . no surprises here but ok for a quick summer read .
i could n't finish it . slow moving , uninteresting . i have read many books on this subject matter that were fascinating . this one was n't .
this is great little story , with clever humor . perfect for readers aged 8 and up . family friendly and not scary .
what a delightful read . the characters are engaging and for a short story , the plot is well developed . i 'll be looking for other stories by this author .
well , it was pretty good but most of these things that this guy showed was in my survival house ... but hey ! the first thing was good . : )
packed full of multiple conflicts and solutions . some great ideas to think about with family and friends . we forget about what our country was built on .
mary 's done it ! put her beautiful , inspiring artwork together with her favorite `` reminders . '' great book to use as my own reminder about what 's truly important .
this book is awesome ! it truly teaches what it takes to be a real christian . i am a christian and recommended this book to one of my christian friends . read on ! ! ! !
i enjoyed this book . it was very well written & the story was interesting . i do n't like to give the book away with a book report , but it was a really good read .

if only this series could go on forever but i have to admit it was amazing so ca n't wait to read the next book
i have many debbie macomber books . this book did not disappoint me . she did just as good a job with this one as her previous books . excellent book .
kept you drawn into story wanting to get to the next page well written full of twists and turns good ending
i enjoyed the first two books . however , the third book is absolutely terrible , i still want my money back for that one ! ! !
the characters in this series mess together and the twists and turns keep you on your toes . ca n't wait to read number three .
this book brought new meaning to crazy lol . great cast of characters and loads of twists and turns to keep me engaged .
first book i got explaining a whole lot of things for me ... loved it & so informative . just opened up my eyes to the real word of god ! ! ! !
part of it were interesting and informative , but it seemed pretty disjointed . i was disappointed in it , overall .
another amazing book ... : d loved all the characters . i love all the books of lizzy . eagerly waiting for black god .
this was a good read and keep me very entertained . i ca n't wait for the full blood to come out and read .
love carl weber , he delivers every time . he does it again with his stories that keep your head in the book .
another great book by joseph flynn . great characters and quirky situations make this a fascinating read . just could n't put it down after i read the first 20 pages .
i am in love with the whole series , the female character , the love , the dog and the crazy family ! i love the rest of the series and definitely want more !
james patterson always turns out a good who done it . a great story and an excellent read . sit back and enjoy .
liked this book , characters were likable , lots of very hot sex & was a quick read . although not much of a solid storyline still worth reading . enjoy !
my daughter bought this book ... ... she like this author she was very happy with and enjoyed it very much and the price was good also .
i enjoyed this book , but eventually i got a bit tired of it . could have been a bit shorter . could have had more 3 dimensional characters . not great literature , but ultimately fun and satisfying .
i love this series it is amazing a very good read but warning once u start to read this series u will not be able to stop lol .
best self help book out there to help you overcome personal fear . easy to understand and implement exercises and words of wisdom .
this was a decent roman set series . i will probably read the next one . it was okay but not great .
i simply loved this book the length , characters , details ... . everything was perfect . it was the right mix of sweet and intense .
quick read and informative , do n't waste time wondering if you should buy it . change your life right now and just buy it already ! your moving in a positive direction !
i found the book okay but could not really picture the children in the story doing the things they were supposed to be doing at the ages given . it seemed a little unrealistic .
read all three , do n't know why got such great reviews . characters were annoying , basically skimmed all stories , could have been told in less than 3 books .
this book is that deal it 's different from everything thing you read this year it will keep you on the edge of your seat . you can tell this author took her time .
you really will not know the identity of the murderer unless you read the complete book . the story is quite involved , but still an outstanding mystery .
i was extremely disappointed with this book . the story had promise but it failed in the delivery . i am glad i only borrowed it because i would have been upset if i had paid for it .
i ca n't get enough of this book ! i got this book two nights ago , and i finished it the following morning . but i continue to read it over again !
good story line . if it was n't for the many typos , i would have given it five instead of four stars .
too dry ... had to force myself to continue reading it in my kindle to get on to something more exciting . would not recommend it to my friends to add to their library .
i absolutely adore these books ! i could not put it down ! ! ! you feel like you are the main character in the story .
deep and complex characters which were well developed . the plot stayed knit together through many twists and surprises . one of tales to read and notice new elements each read .
i rate this book with five stars really enjoyed story and cultural differences . it was wonderful getting the book immediately from amazon and so convenient .
i 've made a few of these meals now . i love how easy they are to make and they taste great !
i am a lover of true crime books , but i could have skipped this one . parts of it were interesting .
a very good read from this author . i hope more to come from this story . the author creates a very good world with great characters .
i absolutely loved this book ! i could not quit laughing and i link forward to the next 2 books in the series .
i loved this book i am waiting somewhat patiently for book 3 to drop . book 1 & 2 i could n't put down until it was over and hated when it did end
wow man this book is like really amazingly good . i could n't set it down at all it was that good
i would recommend this book to anyone who loved the hunger games . this is a great book . it is filled with suspense .
i could n't put this book down ! ! ca n't wait to start the second one . stayed up into the wee hours of the night to finish it .
i enjoyed this book because the story got going right from the beginning . i also enjoyed the characters and could n't predict the ending . good read .
this book has it all : romance , mystery and social commentary . easy to read and full of colorful characters . i enjoyed it immensely .
a little slow at first , but definitely picked up . has everything , love , revenge , family and pets . a different view of world war ii .
i enjoyed this book a lot . my only problem with it was problems were never resolved before the end of the book .
i enjoyed this book the characters worked and i could n't put it down until i had finished the story great
i love everything that ms. gregory has written and this series is no exception . if you 've never read her , start with her first book and go from there ! she is such an intelligent writer .
this novel had a nice story line but it did nothing for my imagination . it 's ok for the weak minded . these sisters were to desperate for me .
there are many women out there that can relate to these women in this book . some choose not to speak on it but it 's a good read .
i enjoyed the series fine , but this one just took it down a notch . characters are not as dynamic or likable as they were in the first three of the series .
i was surprised at how much i loved this series . very easy read and kept me coming back . i did not want to put the book down !
a wonderful conclusion to blood rush . this fast paced sequel takes you on an exciting roller coaster of a journey .
this was bought as a gift for a 9 year old boy . this story lets him know that not everyone is the same or should they be .
i enjoyed the fast pace and characters . will look forward to the next in the series . it was a good read .
but it wo n't stop me from continuing to read her books . i am hoping the next book will be better and up to her usual standards .
i was expecting a much longer book . this is a synopsis of lincoln 's life . it was accurate , just quite brief .
if you travel the world or have any interest in it , this is a great resource to have handy . lots of changes in the last 20 or so years .
when my group said i should read this series , i was very happy because i have a twin ... i read it so fast because my eyes were glued to my kindle ! read it !
i 've always love iris johansen books ! they were always good books to read & they are still good books to read !
this author never disappoints me . this was a very intriguing story . hard to stomach at times as the content was often very dark . still it is important to remember a dark piece of history .
if you like the recipe book , you will certainly like this . the simplicity of the amish life is great to know about .
this book was better than the first and made me very anxious to be able to read the next book in the series .
this was a good , romantic story with suspense . i liked it a lot . not too raunchy , either . interesting characters & plot .
this series is a fun read with laughed . you 'll enjoy the story , hard to put the book down at bed time .
it was one of the best books i have read in years . the book comes full circle . i would read this book over and over .
i worry that even though fiction a lot of this sort of thing goes on . the plot is a good one .
this book is good . i love all three novellas . they make you want to cry and laugh all at the same time !
it 's not as good as the other series , but it 's still a good book . it is n't like the other series at all .
after reading quite a few of debbie 's books , i must say that when i see her name i am biting at the bit to read .
good book but not great . connelly usually has more complex plots . i enjoyed it but not to the point that i liked his other books .
the setting is contemporary paris and the story line is intriguing and focuses on current themes . a good summer read .
what an amazing story . it kept me on my toes ! so many twists and turns . loved it ! kept me guessing !
i liked the action and adventure in this book . and the story is something that stays with you years after you 're finished reading it .
i really liked this book and the characters . i hate that it is a 2 part story line . i just hope the second part lives up to the expectations
need i say more ? you need this in your library to be able to get the picture of what is happening .
great book , i could not put this book down it was that great to read , i was eager to read it
well written , believable characters . i would read a sequel . interesting depiction of families on different sides of the civil war . i liked the florida history , not often included in civil war history .
this church series has been quite interesting and i have n't even read all of the books included in it . this book had me intrigued from the very beginning . definitely a page turner .
i liked the story it was a good mystery and did n't know what was going to happen next several times .
if you liked fifty shades you will love this series ! ! ! great plot great love story awesome characters . ca n't wait for the next one to come out ! ! !
what a roller coaster of a book . i was up and down , i could not put this one down . love gavin ! !
i enjoyed line the story . it is okay for the price , i did purchase the second book because the story is interesting .
once you start these books you will be hooked ! excellent writing and a fascinating plot . i am not so patiently waiting for the third in the series ! come on , kristen !
these two books , by graham carter on this subject was quite good in my opinion and i thoroughly enjoyed reading them
informative , entertaining and just what was needed for theology class . as a student ! , it is helpful and fun ! a plus .
once again i am hooked on a ferro ! sean and avery and all the twists ... does n't disappoint and i 'm craving more ! ! ca n't wait until the next installment !
i have every book in this series so i could n't not have max 's story as well . it was a great read and fell right in line with everything else
i liked this book it was a really good read im a fan of paranormal book and i bought all of these books
great mystery with a very interesting ending . very well-developed characters . although the beginning basically starts big , it is a little slow until later in the book . very well written .
this story is wonderful full of action , tears of sadness as well as laughter , very out there . i loved it ca n't wait to read more .
this was a very quick read . i liked the story line but i think the book should have been longer so the story could be more intricate .
this story is an ok read but i would n't recommend purchasing it . it starts off ok but the longer i read it the harder it was to keep my attention .
i enjoyed it but it was so filled with politics that i felt it dragged a little in the middle . i would however encourage anyone to complete it and not give up because it is worth it .
this is one of my favorite ashley books ! ! so much emotion you all most feel like you are the main character ! ashley takes you into her world in this book ! !
believable characters and plot . very sweet tender love story . i was sad to get to the end . anyone who likes romantic books would like this book
wow ! ! ! what a great disturbing book . it makes you wonder what people are capable of . we hear about serial killers , pray we never encounter one .
if you are a star trek fan this is a must read . it 's a good story well written . came as promised .
i really did not like this book . to me the story was all over the place . this book more read like some political story to make you feel a certain way than a good novel .
this story hit home for me ... and i did n't even realize it until i finished the book ! eye opener for sure
i loved the story . it was a real page turner . i know this is a story that i will likely re-read .
book is very dry and boring so been hard to read at times . info seems ok so far . after i take the test i 'll update this review
this set of books made a great gift for my young grandsons . they enjoyed having several different books to read .

i learned a lot about dogs by reading this book the training and help this dogs give is excellent thanks .
an o.k . book . this seems to contain a lot of common sense practices that people should be aware of naturally .
i quick paced story . i love the community , values and spirit within the stories of the amish . it is just an inspiring story of a spiritual people .
this was the first time i read one of his books . it was a great story . christian at its best .
excellent detail and a more original perspective on angels and demons . the best compliment i can give is to admit i will buy the next in series !
i was glad this book had a happy ending but ... ... i did n't like the way it was written .
great book and very well written . really opened my eyes about angels . i would recommend this book to everyone . great tool for believers .
it was nice to read about familiar characters of cedar cove and to get introduced to new ones from rose harbor inn .
i did n't receive this book , but i would have liked it . did i even order it ... i was interested in it when i looked @ it on line .
such a fun captivating read ! i really enjoyed this book and recommend it to those who love a good christian romance novel ! so good

loved the book and told my mother in law about it , so i ordered it on audio book.. she enjoyed it very much !
if you like sexy scenes , there are lots of them ! there is heroine we can care for , with an interesting plot and fun for all !
i think wow ! says it all ! this review says i have to put in 14 more words , but really , wow ! says it all !
i 've read all the other books so this was a review i just do n't like having to buy it since i have read the other s
i love the jack reacher novels i was disappointed that this was so short even though it was advertised as a novella
this book was not very amusing or even interesting . in fact , it was lame and predictable . if they are hoping to make a series out of this theme they will have to improve greatly .
i really enjoyed this book ! very emotional at times but also showed love and being there for each other ! great author !
it 's a fine background , quick read , but for a $ i 'm satisfied . it stays in the general style of the other books .
this book was the first that i have read by this author . i thought it was a good book with interesting characters and a good story line . it was a little predictable but worth reading .
the story really sucked me in the only thing i did n't like is it ends rather abruptly but still really liked it
not usually my type of book ... but this was gripping from page one ... now i am hooked . could not put it down ... enjoyed every page . searching for more like this .
i could not put it down ! when i was n't reading i found myself wondering what was happening inside ! ca n't wait to read the next series !
i thought this book was very chilling and had a good story line i look forward to reading more of these books
i totally loved this whole series . the stories are very humorous and a quick read . the last book left me wanting more . i recommended it to my friends who also loved it .
a short story that has so many elements to it . you 've got a great tale of adventure mixed with an erotic romance that leaves you wanting more after you 've finished the last page .
another good story in this series - am really enjoying this author and have purchased all the books available on kindle .
after watching the movie i thought i would like these but they were to hard to start . sorry ... not a fan
though i lost interest half way through ... .. it started as a very enticing story , but then it changed , in a way that lost me ... .
i read this book about a year ago . i 'm buying it on kindle so my niece can read it too .
love this book . i have loved all of them so for . i ca n't wait for the next one to come out ! !
with this scenario becoming more possible every day it makes you wonder if its possible . those book lays out the possibilities that are there . very enjoyable read .
i just loved this book and the 3 that followed it ! a great series ! there is mystery and a great love story in each book ! ! !
i enjoyed getting to know emily and to be able to watch her life change . i look forward to part 2 to find out what happens next . this was a real fun read for me .
i really enjoyed this book . the characters were likable and entertaining . i would reccomend to any elvis fan . makes a good beach book or a weekend read .
great ! reminded me of the great escape only without the escape . very moving .
this book started my love for the series and the characters . i could not get enough of them and read the whole series in a week , highly recommend .
i chose this rating because i enjoyed all three of the trilogy books . also kindle books were an easy fast download .
i have n't had a chance to read this yet ( hey , never enough hours in my day ) , but i know i will love it . thank you !
pretty tedious reading , though the idea is very good and it would make a far more interesting movie or on tv . the character would be really interesting to follow ... .
really enjoyed this book . up until the very end , you wonder just how it will turn out , a tragic end or a happy ever after end .
if your looking for a action pack page turner . this is your book . it 's hard to believe that it 's true events . could n't put it down .
there is more than enough reading in this one book at such a reasonable price . definitely the book for mystery readers .
this is an old classic that is just as relevant today as it was years ago when it was first written .
it was a really great book and i enjoyed it very much . a very good read and recommend it to lovers of ww2 .
save your money , its simplistic and formula driven . this is the first and last time i 'll read or by from this author . for the money paid it 's a rip off
chose because you can count on the author for an exciting story full of suspense and intrigue and interesting characters .
this is my favorite book so far ! its every young girls fantasy . i ca n't wait to read the rest of the series .
may plan to use this in a bible study group , but not sure about that yet ... we will have to see .
from the first chapter i was hooked . could n't put it down . leo n nora 's story is amazing . ca n't wait to see what 's next
upon reading her first novel , crazy ladies i was hooked . it is a good sign when you are sad to see a series end .
i loved this book ! awesome read ! i love the characters especially the hero and heroine . beautiful story of love , courage and trust , wonderfully written and intriguing . : ) )
this box set of books was a great combination of different story lines . romance , suspense and intrigue was great . a. must read
i love the author 's work and i love to start a new series . this book kept me wanting to read more chapters than i wanted to in a day . .
an author writes about war , a prince in the war a man & woman finding each other . the things people go through , and to find some kind of happiness .
i can not recommend this series enough ! i do n't know what i will do when i do n't have anymore of these books to read ! ! i am thoroughly enjoying this series .
the story is pure fantasy but does show how to respect one another 's differences . the illustrations are great for just looking at .
again jeff has another hit for his readers ! ! ca n't believe that this series could get any better but yes it really did . bring on book 3 ! !
this is a very moving account of a man 's relationship with his father , full of memorable scenes and powerful writing ...
yes just pick up and read this book . great , great , great , great , great , great , great , just like the others in this series
it was an okay book , not anything to talk about kind of corny in some ways i would not recommend
as always i enjoyed another book by these two authors . good characters and plot development . enough left unfinished to hint at what may take place in the next book .
like i said in the title , this book rocks . i loved the storyline and the characters . i loved everything about this book . kevin is a great writer . keep them coming man .
this is a very quick and fun read . i think it took me less then 10 minutes to read . there 's two short stories included and both will fill you with christmas cheer .
have n't had a lot of chance to use this book , but so far am very pleased with it . for being used , it was in excellent condition .
nicely made magazine , drawings are of a classic style . good but not outstanding .
the pages are very colorful and cute . i would be happier with a few more animals included , but that 's okay . i plan to get the other books in the series next .
it was really awesome , with a surprise ending , but i want to read the next one for free . man , do i wish i could .
these were a good mix of stories that were fun to read . started me to read the after series books . this was a great way to read books from various writers .
had never read any of her novels and found this novel compelling ! i laughed , i cried a great deal . difficult time in our history .
i like a good story line and something that keeps my interest and a love of adventure does just that .
this book was fantastic . it made me realize what i need to do in my life . things happen for a reason .
i found this book to be very creative . at the same time , i felt that it gave me some new insights into my relationship with god .
diana palmer has a way of making me feel as though i am in the story and know the characters personally .
easy light read . look forward to reading more books by this author . i am from the area this book is written about and loved every bit of it .
i liked this book but i felt it was missing something . it had suspense and intrigue but i missed jack , the owner of private , who was not in most of the book !
i learned about this book from my son . he went to school with the author and had it on his christmas list . i read it on my kindle in 4 days and really liked it .
this is an interesting read and gives some good advice . had this once in paperback but lost it during a move . now have it on kindle and am looking forward to finishing it .
a very strange but somewhat predictable story . how to pick yourself up and deal with the future . a cute book to read .
the book was absolutely amazing . lots of suspense , very well written , great storyline . very different from the usual and very good . i definitely recommend !

i have almost every book dr phil wrote ! i love this book most of all ! this book has helped me recognize the different signs that certain people show in their lives and how to avoid them .
this book was a surprise ! at first i was somewhat turned off by the content , then it took an interesting turn . i ended up really liking the unique twist that developed .
good read but why do the bad guy always have to win . really no one knew where she lived but three people and all three were dead just a little far fetched .
no real surprises , so it does n't get 5 stars , but it was a fun read , and i want to read the next one .
interesting book . kept my interest the entire time . would recommend it to anyone as long as they read all three in the series .

this was an excellent book . i enjoyed it so much , i went on to purchase two more of her books .
great book , really funny , actually kind of useful . great laughs ! ! i would absolutely recommend this to anyone with a sense of humor ...
i liked the idea for the story , but it was far too long and drawn out , boring in some spots , could have been either shorter or had other story lines in it .
i have had this book for a very long time and i just love coming back to it for a good laugh and lovely story .
i really like to read the box set of books because each book is a little different and each character is different and they are a faster reading group of books
this book had strong characters and background knowledge of relationships . i enjoyed this read , and would recommend it to others .
i purchased this book for my grandmother . it has many great ideas to make cards and has something for everyone !

one of the worst books i 've ever read ! having to write such a lengthy explanation as to why i enjoyed this book puts me off ever wanting to rate one again !
the story took a little time to get into with so many characters . however , these were women that you learned to care about . the best war stories are the ones about people
this book kept me i suspense from the moment i read it . it kept me awake until i finished the book .
this book is wonderful and gives an intimate perspective of what it was like to grow up in afghanistan , helping readers to see the humanity in all of us .

lately all the books i 've read in this category just leave me feeling ... blah ... ... . but not this book ! i loved it and i 'm now moving to the second book in the series .

i started this book on the way to the beach i did n't want to leave my room , i could not put it down !

for dragon story lovers this is great in fact the whole series is awesome ! ! where does the author get his ideas ! !
i really expected more from this read . it moved slow and left me wondering when the punch line would appear . none there .
i found this book to be somewhat complicated yet understandable . it was intriguing and kept me guessing on the `` who done it `` aspect . i would highly recommend it to anyone . especially ww ii buffs .
this book reminds me that it is better to lose on the right side than to win on the wrong one .
that was so funny and cool i could not stop reading ! i am going to read the second one i even funnier
i never miss reading an alex cross novel . mr. patterson brings in family dynamics in these novels which i like . this one met all of my expectations . continue writing alex cross novels .
funny writing . i liked the characters . good story and good writing . and most important ... a stand alone book !
easy to read , and can ' put it down ! ! ! the intrigue holds your attention from paragraph to paragraph and page to page .
this was a great mystery . aside from the mystery itself , i enjoyed the characters and hope the author does write more about these characters !
i really did n't see it ending like that . this is my first time reading something by this author . i will be reading her past & future books .

this book was perfect from beginning to end . if you love jack , you will love this . very riveting .
its a good classic , but you must be able to follow it , it is a hard read .
this book is . filled with pain and loss but also strong love and life . it 's like a danielle steele book .

this book has a lot of nice recipes , easy to follow instructions but some recipes do n't have pictures . i still would recommend it .
i enjoyed reading this book very much . it captured and captivated me to another time and place . reality and fantasy make for a very entertaining read .
card has a way of telling a story so as to make you wonder not if it will happen but when will it happen .

i have enjoyed all of these books . the first one took me a few chapters before i got caught up in it all , but after that , i could not read them fast enough .
a pretty good book for a surface view of the ultimate warrior , a navy seal ! a person ca n't really know all they do or have to do unless you are one .

a collection of short , somewhat twisted psychological stories , none of which were long enough to go anywhere or really pull me in .
jamie 's writing is so good and i loved this series i 've recommend to other people . i enjoyed reading all her books ,
looking for material by sophie as i write ... it turned out to be good read , you may find it worth the reading material too .
this was a fast paced , action thriller that i could hardly put down ! excellent characters , good plot , and throughly enjoyable . i would read more from this author !
this book is a help for one 's prayer life . it is a book with stories that help you relate to your god . a small book and can be used for meditation .
this is by far my favorite book in the series ... .a beautiful story of love , healing & trust ... read it ! you wo n't be disappointed !
this book brought out a lot of emotions , there was laughter , tears , and a whole lot of courage . i usually do not read a book twice but i can see myself reading this one again .
i just felt it was too raunchy . i kept reading , hoping i would find the book as much fun as i find the lady generally . but it just did n't happen .
i read a lot . sometimes i want to read a book that is short and spicy . these stories never let me down . keep them coming ...

disappointing , disjointed and dull . do n't waste your money on this one . there were passages of pure beauty but most of the novel was implausible and boring .

good read for when you need some quick inspiration . only took about 5 minutes to read the whole thing . 1

short stories almost always leave me feeling incomplete ; this one did n't . it 's just a sweet amish romance with some likable characters and good feelings .
this was a fun book to read , the main characters played off of each other well throughout the story , and the minor characters added side stories that kept moving forward with the main theme .

fell for it could not put it down and can not wait till next installment , hope they do a few more movies too
great characters . absolutely enjoyed the kids having a good time together . was hoping that somehow things would work out for them being friends .
this one did n't bite me as well as some of her books . i ca n't say i did n't like it , i just did n't like it as much . still worth a read though .
i thought this was a great book , helping me down a better path in life , and learning to just be happy .

i read this book based on a recommendation by rachel held evans ( whose books i love ) . the first few chapters were really good - then it became elementary and a little silly .
this reads like a science fiction book , but it is totally possible to be non-fiction and actual history . the presentation makes more sense than printed history books .
awesome book . i read it in no time . i 'm glad everything worked out in the end . i do love happy endings . great job .
an interesting angle on the life of elizabeth to anyone who is interested in history . the book is written in concise and easy to understand language and i enjoyed it very much

this product is brand new and in excellant condition . i bought it for my wife to use in her classroom . she is satisfied with it .
this was something of a page-turner . i liked some of the author 's vivid descriptions of characters . i prefer , however , a more challenging read .
i absolutely love everything that she writes especially everything regarding this particular man . you just dont know what is next . just love it
it thought it had a bit of a slow start , but it did not take long before the story took off . i was hooked from page to page . excited to start the next book .
to the family and child in this story . he ( 3 years old ) walks around looking for things that are brown like him .
i really enjoyed this super fast read and it had me mad , happy and smiling in many different parts . it ended nicely as well ...
do not buy this book if you are new to the vegan lifestyle . it is not helpful at all . too scientific .
very entertaining . light and easy to read . enjoyed it ! will read more by same author . also liked it was free on kindle
read half of the book thinking it would get better and it did n't so i gave up . ca n't believe they put this book in schools for kids to read .
i love these sweet romance stories ... the book is a little predictable , but an enjoyable read . i wish i had a spirit 's advice some days , too .
this is a great book , full of wonderful inventive ideas to use and pass along . i really enjoyed reading it with all the new ideas .
i did n't like the story line nor the author 's style of writing . please do not relate this author to daniel silva who seems to do more research .
great , loved it . the series continues to move forward in action filled adventure . i can not wait for the next book .
this book was amazing . i could n't put it down and immediately started this one as soon as i finished the first in the series . i love how it continues right where the other one left off .
i really enjoy the historical , romantic , inspirational novels . this has it all . i really only read at night before going to sleep and it is a perfect book to fit my needs .
imaginative , action packed , emotional , thought provoking and creepy . interesting characters and plot lines keep one guessing . nice to be surprised . plan to check out book 2 .
this was a good book from the beginning , would recommend it but i just like these kind of books . good !
this series just keeps getting better and better ! i thought book one was great but book two is amazing ! this author knows what she 's doing . moving on to book 3 ! !
loved it as a child when my teacher read it to the class . i loved it again when i read it myself and hope my children and grandchildren enjoy it too !
i read some of the reviews before i bought this book and almost did n't buy it . i 'm so glad that i took the chance . i am already to start reading the next book .
kept interest . loved the characters . pretty good book . only wish it could have been longer with more on their relationship
however , the end is predictable and long winded . he does , however , keep the reader on their toes .
this has to be the best new series i read in a long time . the author is great and i ca n't wait for cash and the other men 's book .

usually , books by jeffrey archer are hard to set down . the short stories make it much easier although i still had trouble putting the book down between stories . more good archer reading .

wow this is a great book . the author really did a lot of research in order to write such a great non-fiction book.the title is right on because this cop will not quit ! ! ! ! ! !
held my attention for the first few chapters and then i got bored . moves rather slowly to build character development , set scenes , but overall if you are not into suspense , pass over this book .
the author has a real talent for drawing you in to the story and making even flawed characters , both interesting and likable .

my little niece greatly enjoyed her story time with this book . we make sure time is spent everyday reading and doing crafts together .
i like the books more for their insight into italy and the scenes about venice , than anything else . the characters are interesting .

love the 1st virgil flowers 's book and have to read the remaining one . so far , so good . really , really , really .
this was a book in a series that i enjoyed . it really has me guessing who the murderer was ! i liked it !
the first book was actually a book . this was like a chapter of a book so it was n't as appealing as the other one
this is a really great book . i do n't know what else to say . i feel so bad for angel and what she went through
great book ! ! can not wait for the next one . loved the story and the characters . super excited to see where she goes with the next story
i bought the entire series . my grandchildren , just learning to read , love these books . and they want me to read them over and over again ... that 's good enough for me

first if you have n't read up to the sight you would n't understand this book , second it is a great book and i love the imagery .

excellent as it is every year ! the best in the market and no one can call themselves a writer without this book !
my first read of a book by ms. harris . she is quite gifted . most of the narrative was predictable . i 'll be interested in taking a look at some of her other writings .

a pleasant read . liked the characters . not something i 'd stay up all night reading but definitely kept my interest and i 'd pay to read another one .
a very heart warming tale . really makes you think of the power of god and how he is in all things great and small
as i rated it -- it 's okay . i will be careful of the sandra brown books i purchase in future .
my daughter needs her mind captivated . just the title was enough to get her started on reading this . she loved it , and i think any little girl could get into this book .
mysteries are a favorite and those that feature actual events are even more fascinating . i favor ann rules books for their content and her style of writing .
in the middle of reading this book and so far , so good . i look forward to seeing what the end is .
michael phillips makes all of stories the best ! this is one the reader ca n't put down . god makes it all work out in these character 's situation .

i did n't know if i would like this book a little or if it would be just ok , but i really like the story line . i can wait to read the next book in the series .
liked the fact i could get all of the series at once and read them one after the other . i like getting a whole series at once and often do that even when i get real books .

i really like this series i just wish it was longer . i felt like things could have gone further in depth but instead it was rushed even at the end
its a pretty easy read for a series . the plot gets to be the same after awhile and although i enjoyed reading it i thought that a bit more effort can go into character development and storyline

too long and boring . so far into the fiction that it loses all sense of any spiritual theme . too many strange names and titles that i could not keep track of most of them .

i bought this for my mom . she loved it . i have since passed it on to others who read danielle steele and finally to the public library . anyone who loves steele will enjoy this novel .
this book is truly funny . who knew cats could write poetry ? they did , apparently . a great gift for a first time cat owner .
while not as good as the first book , and a bit of a slow start , it is still worth reading , particularly if you enjoy the genre .
completely out of the realm of possibility but a good tale nonetheless . i looked for others in the series on amazon but could not find them : - (

i really enjoyed this installment of the body rock series . i am really rooting for these two to have their romance , love the sexual tension and the actual play . ca n't wait for book 4 .
this book was great all the way through , but in the story the characters point of view seems unrealistic and fake , which makes it hard to love the characters . even though you may love their story .
i saw the movie , now i am able to enjoy the book . it is just as exciting and intriguing as the movie .
great book ! i did n't want to put it down . i also did n't want it to end . ca n't wait to start the next one .

this is a book that should be required reading , especially for those in the medical profession . it is a beautiful story , and gives a wonderful perspective on life .
a flight of fantasy that carries you to a new world in your mind - it 's hard to out the book down until you have finished and then you 're ready for more .

good reading especially for those people trying to decide where they belong , where they fit it . interesting story line . enjoyed it but think that teenagers would like it even more .
i have always loved robert frost . this ebook is great for frost fans . and it has all the good ones .
just what every girl dreams of , a handsome prince to rescue her and fight for her and then win her heart . a wonderfully written christian book about seeking the lord and then waiting patiently for his answer .

lucas davenport has become so political and boring that i had to make myself finish this book . what a far cry from the original prey novels . just sad .

this is one of the best books i have read in a long time . the content was put together in ways to hold the readers interest . great book !

a fun , clean read ! thoroughly enjoyed the storyline , and anxious to read the next book ! loved the characters and the dynamic relationships .
bought this one and found it was a good read . someone else had mentioned this one so i decided to give it a try . i enjoyed it and may go back to by the sequels .
read this one twice and found some things i had missed on first read . ca n't wait for more from this author .
brain candy . that 's what this is . i chose this rating because i liked this book more than divergent . not typical of the second in a series usually , but true .
interesting concept and the story was well carried out . loved it very much and the emotional drama just made me care about the main character that much more .
i am always interested in a good story that is also christian based . i have not read other books by this arthur and look forward to more of her writings .

this one is good . have read her stories for years . ca n't get enough . great author and easy reading . highly recommend this book .
this book started out slow . the story seemed to repeat itself over and over again . the story was good just to drawn out for my taste .
i do like books by cassie edwards . some more so then others but this was a great book and it did hold my interest

i found this to be an entertaining , if somewhat hard to follow at first story .
i love this series and think that the idea for this world is very unique . i 'm sad it is only a trilogy .
the first of the series introduces you to the beginning of the end as you meet 3 characters who have seen the end of mankind as we know it
this was the second time i read this series and i loved it just as much the second time ! well done !
interesting story enjoyed reading it do n't want to give to much away to spoil the story line for everyone as that would n't be fair
the thing about a series and a certain character is that you hope there really is no last book in a series . i hope i am doing

this book really got started at the end . this book was confusing throughout , but gave me real hope at the end . let 's hope that this book begins to clear things up .
every book has been wonderful . i love his story , and the trials and challenges along the way . good clean books are what i love to read . this is it ! ! !
the writing is not the best - i would not read more from this author . it is not a smooth read .
solid through out but what really made it worth while was the ending . made me real interested in picking up the next one . would definitely recommend .
first bible purchase . this one is easy for a person who does n't understand the old testament . another plus this is the bible my pastor uses so i can follow with him .
interesting and scary . it 's amazing what powerful people get up to and have no thought for others , only their own selfish desires .
i read this ages ago it seems like now . i read it again recently and really enjoyed it . what a difference a few years of perspective will give an audience .
the characters are nicely drawn out and the story line is , sadly , very believable . i 'm going to go get the second book in the trilogy once i post this review .
i ca n't believe i did n't find this author sooner . he 's such a gifted author . i 'll read more of his books .
another easy read and great book . story flows and keeps the reader committed to continue without putting the book down .

good plot , some strong character development . interesting ideas to look beyond the book for answers and endings . well played , mr. grisham .
maeve binchy is one of my favorite authors . i read every book she writes . love her warm and fuzzy style .
this book well slow to start builds to good suspense makes you look at the dynamics of today in a new light . highly recommended
gabaldon is a great story teller . she keeps the reader engaged and brings out some interesting history . it is best to read the books in order but all here outlander books are excellent .
he was very graphic in this book , more so than any of his others . kept you reading until the end for sure ! !
grisham 's works always great . he holds your interest throughout and makes the impossible become possible and the most unusual plots .
this book caught me off guard there was romance excitement espionage enough to keep me interested . what a twist at the end . now i want to know what happened to the brother

fast paced exciting . nice twist and turns great combination of mystery and adventure i will follow this author with anticipation .
i saw this author on tv and he made the book out to be more interesting than it actually was to read . not a bad book , but i became bored after a few chapters .
it reads easy and well . not much depth or storyline . kept waiting for something to happen . certainly didnt care for the ending .

i appreciated the story but was looking for a little more to keep my attention . overall it is a good book , just the wrong one for me .
bought as gift . i bought my wife the whole series that was available at this time . this is the only book out of them that she read . so i guess this is the good one ?
it was a fun read , something different from what i usually read ; i like books that have the same characters in them that you can follow .
its ok im learning to navigate to the chapters and verses that i want to read , it 's taking longer than i expected
the content was very religious , a little more than i 'd like but it was still a positive book worth reading .
i love the titanic type stories . this one was similar in that she went to america for the chance of new life .
turning what could be a trashy novel ( which i love by the way ) into a story about the love of family and pack .
this is a solid 4. it wo n't change your life and i highly doubt it will be the best book you ever read , but it is definitely entertaining and had me hooked from the beginning .
read this ! you 'll like it . this was a little convoluted but it was worth the time to read . i suggest that you read the books in order . it is n't necessary but it helps .

i bought this book for my grandson . he is beginning to read . he really enjoyed this book !
very good for a short story . action , romance , danger all rolled into one . what 's not to like . good job . thanks .
excellent story line which is both inspiring and heart warming . this story brings up many thoughts and feelings regarding the years and people during this era .
gives the straight facts about what to expect , along with the much needed humor ! if you , or someone you know is expecting twins , i would highly recommend reading this book !
this was an excellent story that was not your typical western . an excellent plot with very good characters . a hard book to put down .

this was an amazing and exciting book to read . i loved all the interesting and suspenseful parts of it . i highly recommend this book ! ! !
do n't get me wrong i loved most of the book , until the end . the ending was too short like it had been thrown together quickly .
demon lovers is totally hot sexy and fun . a great twist in the alpha males and the female who fights with them every step of the way . great and amazing read
this book had some helpful tips and some dialogue that was a starting place . it did seem a little outdated though .
you eat up the characters who are strong , witty , intelligent and fun ... the story leads you into a drama you do n't expect and you want to find out what will happen in the end ...
i have not finished this book yet , but loving it so far . ca n't wait to finish and then go for the next in the series .
have n't really used it too much , but it 's a great way to find words you would never thing to rhyme with other words .
if you want some very short reads that are pretty much packed with vampires , werewolves and steamy writing then these are for you .
this was a great book . it was recommended to read to me . a real eye opener for me . i think everyone should read it .
i liked the book overall . some of the aspects were not real life . this was not one of my favorite 's but still good .
i think this series just keeps getting better as it goes . it is n't perfect by any means but the story and characters are so compelling that you just ca n't help but get sucked into it .
a wonderful heartwarming book . this is one of the few books that i will keep . i would definitely recommend it to readers who enjoy reading old fashion type love stories . jason wright is an excellent author .
i can read anything by zane and love it . this was nothing short of great . i cant wait for more zane novels to come out .
this is a good book has a nice story line that keeps you interested yes it needs a editor but all in all a good book and am looking forward to the next one
i really could not get into this story , because the bible tells us that we can get angry but to sin not and some of his actions were not those of a pastor ,
mary 's story is her journey that helps us to understand god 's love for us always . i would highly recommend her book for yourself and for a gift to those you love .
characters continue to develop in this series . a very enjoyable read , interesting plot line , lots of action . i look forward to the next installment .
all of these books were very good . i could hardly out them down . they 're great love stories with a very intriguing twist in them ,
i loved this book , because i believe everything i 've ever heard , and i think you should too . you do n't even need to check any of beck 's claims for accuracy -- why bother ?
i read this book and was n't sure if i wanted to try another . i do n't hate this book ; i just wo n't buy any more by this author .
just one season in london is a well-written witty historical . i loved the rich characters and was glued to the pages eager to see what would happen next .
wow this is a must read i completely immersed myself in the pages of this ladies life i recommend you to read it too
too much detail concerning the oil business in alaska . the plot could have been a bit stronger . good characters , as always , and an action filled conclusion save the story .
what an interesting concept for a story . this was a very different concept to think about . what an imagination the author has .
this book was ok but it did n't do it for me 100 % the concept was interesting but i just could n't get invested enough into the characters .
this book was really well written and her characters were very well written , and i ca n't wait to read more of her books..

this book was absolutely heart wrenching . lots of twists and turns . it was n't the best ending i. my opinion but i was good .
i liked this book at the start but find it is getting a bit like a soap opera , almost contrived . it 's an o.k . read if you go through it quickly

maggie writes a very good story . she paints a picture with her words . i could picture the scenes in my head while reading .

this was a fun take on the traditional sherlock holmes . if you enjoy sherlock holmes you should consider this book . i plan to watch for more .
great book of history stories i have not heard about before and was not introduced to in schools . if you enjoy finding out about new individuals in history and other culture 's stories this is an enlightening read .
once you start , hard to put it down ! ! ca n't wait to move on to the second book . definitely better than the movie , but books always are ...

a good read based on some recent truths about ireland . it is well written with engaging characters and a fine ending .

that is what i love about her writing , you never know where the tale will take you and her characters are real .
all of these books are a great read . but seriously , this is one of the most twisted love stories ever ! !
one of the best in the jack reacher series ! if you liked other reacher novels you will love this one .
too much unnecessary death . female character was silly and i had hoped for a better ending . i wo n't read any more from this author .
i hope that this author will continue to write this type of book . her heroine is wonderful and the characters are exceptionally good .
i expected a book full of true crime stories , but instead it was a few very short article length stories with very little details
an enjoyable book . i would read it again , but like to make sure all the related books are available first . i do not like books that do not really have a satisfying ending .
this book is ok. its very long so it takes a while to read . it does n't really pick up but stays at the same pace throughout the book
i had read on of his books previous . like this series because i could finish each one in one night .
this book was definitely different from most romance novels which made it interesting and hard to put down . i look forward to others by this author

i already knew i loved the book , was just trying to buy a third & # 34 ; gift & # 34 ; copy , for everyone loves it so !
my goal is to get to this level of perfection . most inspiring book i have seen . i will work out of this book one day soon .
limited but most folks do n't prepare anyway so it is good for a start or refresher . fairly repetitive and limited on new ideas .
decent legal thriller with a strong story line and well drawn characters . , one to read if you like legal and courtroom drama .
although i found the book quite entertaining , it was a tad far fetched . there did n't seem to be any conclusion to the adventure .
this is a very emotional story that grabs you right from the start . a roller coaster of emotions that will make you smile , laugh and cry .
i bought this for my intro to fiction class but have really come to enjoy it . anyone who likes to write or is interested in improving would benefit from this book .
interesting from the very first page . easy to read and keeps your attention . i enjoyed the book and would buy more of his books . well written !

very good love story . i wish there were men put there like that . the world would be a better place .
these two books were so funny , however makes you also think that this probably goes on today we common people just do n't know it .
this is great for our ladies ' bible study . the chapters are short and inspire discussion . it is good for motivation and reflection on individual quiet times . the study guide is not needed .
it is very hard to get excited about a relationship that involves being pregnant nine months of every year for years .
funny dialogue and situations which might happen in real life . excellent characters and plot twists that keep the reader interested .
loved this entire series ... couldnt put it down , probably read one story per night maybe took a little longer ... i was addicted ...

never read this author before so did not know what i was missing . really good . will look for her books in the future .
recommend reading this gem . it is a wonderful and attention grabbing book . great job by the author .
loved this story & he fact that there were a lot of steamy sex scenes . loved the story line between the 2 main characters as well as the side story for kim 's mother .
i loved this story . the 2 main characters are great - and the storyline was good too - always want these kinds of stories to keep going : )
just one great book , the kind that is hard to put down.. will read more of this author for sure .
sad , funny , exciting , poignant , surprising . loved nathan ! and lily ! hope they get together in a future book . excellent , quick read .
it 's an old book and a classic , but get ready for some really boring reading . a collection of key points would save a lot of time .
while the book could have used better editing , the unbelievable stories more than make up for it . should be a movie .
the book was good it was just so fast . they meet and everything happened so fast . but it was cute and i liked the character .
an interesting subject for a history and or american history lover . many facts in this book not in other books i 've read on these people
this book is a basic nursing school textbook with a ton of information in a fairly easy manner to follow .
this book is so cute . jack is a normal dog that does the same things as my dog , and you can just imagine him actually thinking these things ! enjoy a good laugh !
not nearly as funny as i hoped it would be . this was the first book i 've read by this author . will probably give her another chance sometime to make a better impression .
i am taking a class and this is a well written book on project management . it is well organized for the beginner .
i purchased this for my kindle from amazon and did not enjoy at all . i would not recommend this unless you are desperate for something to read .
it had a good story line , but i felt that it had to much romance , but that is my personal opinion i am not real fond of romance novels .
good writing , good story line , good characters . i would recommend this book to fans of john sanford and michael connelly .
i really enjoyed this book a lot more than i expected to , the more i read the more i liked it ! the concept seemed pretty corny but the execution was surprisingly wonderful .
poorly written and hard to follow . i could not finish it . made a mistake buying this . wish i could get my money back !
without doubt one of the best books i 've ever read . very deep . very insightful . very human . i look forward to reading some of the author 's other books .
the book was really short . i am real big fan of a & j but instead of making a part 2 , they should have completed this book .
i liked the main character , and the others were well developed . the story line was good and unfolded well . i did not like the fact it 's a continuing story . i prefer clear cut endings
liked it , good book . started out a bit slowly but later picked up . need 7 more words to finish this review
i have read other books from this author in the series and so far have not been disappointed . i will read other books from this author .
i liked it and i will definitely buy the next one . i has tons of angst and keeps the storyline moving .
this book was n't at all what i expected . it was much more . it was hard to put down . i felt breathless from the suspense of parts of it .
this is a book that kept my interest . i had a hard time putting it down . it is such a sweet story , that it brings inspiration ...
the story seemed rather predictable and yet it easily kept my interest to the very end . the characters do n't have the depth that jane austen 's books provide , but it 's a nice read .
excellent reading , powerful teaching tool . i will share this book with others . very spiritually enlightening and refreshing . i 'd like to receive more on subject .
l am a big fan of amish stories . loved the mix of amish & english in this story . ca n't wait to read the next one .
i have n't finished this book yet but i give it 5 stars . it has kept me interested and i have no idea what the end will bring .
ca n't wait to read the next book ! sometimes predictable but only because i read so many but loved it any way .
nothing particularly great . writing is not too bad , plot was sort of predictable . i do n't find the heroine particularly engaging - the author made her quite annoying , in fact .
this was terrible . it made absolutely no sense , it was just a lot of ideas thrown together . i 'm glad it was free !
i guess i thought there would be more recipes since she is a chef ? i would rather have a whole recipe book from her
i can not say enough great things about this book . i absolutely loved it . i will be looking for more of this author 's books immediately !
not as good as most of her books . it was okay but i did n't like it as much as other books she has written .
it was n't what i expected , but i am pleased with it . it will work for what i need it for .
i finished this book in two days it was so good ! ! ! there was not a slow part the hole time ! i loved it
true love at its best . the story line was strong and each person stayed true to their personalities throughout the book .
i read this years ago when i was little in a reader 's digest compilation so when i saw it offered for kindle , i grabbed it up .
i chose to read this book on a whim ... now i am looking forward to reading more by this author ! thanks !

could not put this book down . i could n't figure out who did it up until the very end ! ! ! great mary higgins clark book .
this book turned out better than i thought it would . i was a little concerned at the beginning but the author pulled it out in the end .
ca n't wait for the next book . hurry please . i know this a story but some truth is there . awful way to live .
it 's dumb that i ca n't just leave a star rating here ! why does amazon make you write all this crap .
great read - i loved how you could root for and hate the main characters at the same time . was n't sure how it was going to end , and i think the author did it perfectly .
read this entire series ! ! ! i could n't put them down . went from one book and right into the next one . sat up all night a couple of nights to finish !
this is an excellent read for children . the pictures are good and it has a wonderful moral . i enjoyed reading the rhymes .
i like all the big girl books ... they make you feel like it might be possible for a big girl to have love too
a nice collection of warm and fuzzy romances . where falling in love is the essence we all desire and deserve . good read .
great book with a little romantic comedy a must read could n't put it down ca n't wait to read the next book
this is a sweet series that makes you want more and more . only one more left of the tough guy 's
this book was very good could never put it down kept me thinking about life when i moved away from my friends two years ago .

i 'm not must of a reviewer . i either like a book or not . i enjoyed this one , interesting characters and plot .
i was surprised that this book took so long to read . it was too wordy and i struggled to get to the end . i skipped a lot of it .
contains a great set of new recipes to try . the narrative portion can be a bit repetitive , but the meals are easy to make and usually contain ingredients that are not difficult to find .
a well written story that 's a bit different than the normal thriller . very believable characters with no nonsense or fluff thrown into it . the book is a fairly fast read & very enjoyable
we all could all use a different and positive perspective in life and this book certainly does that for you !
four novels all creating a complex , human protagonist solving crimes in a very realistic way . all the characters are well developed . sorry i finished so soon .
love this whole trilogy . the way it went back and forth and how the narrator found out about his mother was great !
this was a good book but only a one time read . it was a bit hard to follow but if your a d & d player you 'll get it . the end is interesting ... ..
on of my favorites as a kid and i still love it . the story is simple and fun and the artwork is so very captivating for young kids . a new generation in my house loves this book !

follow up for lucy & jude as they take the next step in life & their relationship . ca n't wait for the final installment of the series !
agatha christie remains one of the top all time mystery writers , even after almost 40 years after her death . great !
very good for someone trying to understand a betrayal in their marriage . a good help in learning to forgive and make your marriage not the same but maybe even better
i love how the storyline starts and love the series . but i do n't like the really long ones . i like this short series . thoroughly enjoy it !
read all three books in the series and really liked them . well written . loved getting to know the different cities through the author 's description . worth reading .

a great love story . this book was filled with heartache and pain but also love . the characters were amazing written by the author for what happens in the book . thanks for writing an excellent book .
good story concept . sadly the chapters jumped around and i never knew where i was - past , present , future . it was ok .
every turn of the page brought new suspense and questions . hard to put down . kept my attention until the last chapter .

this one is another fantastic book by nora roberts . a great beginning to what i believe will be a fabulous trilogy . i ca n't wait for book two to arrive on my kindle .
same story plot as first just different sister different man . it was ok but i found it to be too predictable .
short , not enough to go off of . i thought it was a chapter that could have been added to one of the other books .

the prince is probably the best work of lit . that relates to the western politics of modern times .
great can not wait for next book the author has the touch . jack needs a son to replace him , thanks
i tried to read this to my daughter and she was so bored with it . i think maybe older kids would enjoy it more .
normally i like these stories but just could n't get into this one . read three chapters and deleted it from my kindle .
fun , easy reading , likeable characters . not sure if the story line was really believable but it was entertaining and led to a spin off of one of the characters .
i could n't stop reading this book . you become emotionally attached to the characters and it always keeps you guessing what will happen next . looking forward to walking disaster !
i like how it 's about regular girls and not some gifted children or special children . i 'm not saying i do n't like those books but it is a good change .
loved original subject matter . well written . had to get book 2 as i could n't put this book down . will look for other books by this author .
i found this book to be boring and disjointed and almost `` fake '' literature - whatever i mean by that . did not like this at all .
this story was fun to read . it has civil war historical facts that i usually find quite dull ... .but they are wrapped up in the story so well it was easy to read .
characters interesting . i could n't guess the ending . i definitely recommend this for an intriguing mystery without a lot of violence .

great thanks for the book and will be rereading it later on in the future will also read more of this series later on
a quick read - great to take on vacation . i thought it was interesting and i liked the characters and the plot .
as great as the books before . loved every word . i swear i could not put it down . totally worth not sleeping to finish it .
not what i expected at all . failed to catch my attention . that 's about it but they 're making me write 20 words so here they are .

some of these characters are great but others are not so much fun . this was not one of my favorite reads .
just think edgar a. poe meets stephen king in this quick thrill ride that keeps your kindle finger racing to keep up with your reading ! !

excellent story , writing , character development and ending ! highly recommend this series . you will not want to put it down ! you will be taken on a wonderful fantasy ride .
anne perry 's latest christmas story . i like that she picks secondary characters from longer books , and tells something else about them or finishes their story , with a christmas lesson added . worth reading .

this book was okay ... the lead male character was interesting , but the female was a bit boring except towards the end

she told me read it and she loved it . she ca n't wait until next one is available . graphics are great .
i enjoyed reading this story . the story seems to be too wide in the settings . i did n't like the ending . the central family should not have to die to end the story .
this read for me was so good . i plan to have my children read this as well . it is very uplifting provided such a positive outlook on some of life 's circumstances .
several twists i did n't see coming . almost difficult to read as a parent . definitely read more of this author . solid
i love dogs and i love everything you can write about them . but this is a special book , very interesting and concerned to show several sides of the subject .

i absolutely loved this book ! ! ! ! i ca n't wait to read the next book . this is one of my new favorite series ! ! !
this was not what i expected . the story dragged on for me . i got bored with it even though i stayed with it .
each one of this series makes you hope there will be another . it really gets you involved in this family and their lives
this is a fun book to read . have given multiple times as a gift .
this book needs to have more story or plot . this story is a sweet little story but not enough for a book .
this pattern was easy to follow . my daughter really enjoyed it and completed it quickly . the finished doll is fairly cute too .
this book held my interest and was certainly a page turner . i did n't rate it a five , as i do n't know if it will draw me to read the sequel .
although i am not a big fan of coming of age romance novels i have to say this is one of the best books i have read lately .
it has everything and more a beginning runner should know . it is a very easy read . i recommend it to any runner .
everyone should read this book and then reread every so often . words can not describe how wonderful this book is and how helpful it will be in your life . love it ! love it ! love it !

i have recently started reading harlan coben writing . i believe i will greatly enjoy this book . thank you so much
so much imagination and fun trying to cheer these guys forward . loved the ending looking to the future for all of them .
reading this book felt like living through it again but with revelations not previously known -- or perhaps forgotten . i considered it well written .
it is very informative about the holy spirit and the holy spirit is just as important as god and the son they all three are very important and he helps you to understand it .
i was hooked at the beginning of the book . not the ordinary type of time jumping book . great characters , great storyline and i ca n't wait for the next in this series .
as a children 's picture dictionary it was basic but good . better modern comprehensive guides are available with photographs but this is ok for a child , or beginning student .
this book moves ! it has just the right amount of mystery and action . i look forward to the next one .
what a wonderful love story . worth so much more than the .99 cents i paid . you will not regret . great smut !
i loved the book . it is sad that they need to make the other books cost money instead of it being free . i want to read the others ! ! ! ! !
a great summer weekend read . well done without being over done , great characters , and sound plot well worth the time .

hard to get into interesting story line though . needed more excitement more twists to the plot good setting though would read more by this author
i love this story because it 's not typical . it has twist and turns that kept me interested and intrigued . i highly recommended this series !
great descriptive story . the book took you through many emotions and you care about the characters . a book i will recommend
if i had known this in the beginning i would n't have started this series . buying chapters of a book is not my idea of good marketing .
i have read all of the alex cross books , this one included . they are all great . this one included . james patterson 's books are all great ! ! ! '

this a great series with a great story line . it is very well written , and enjoyable reading . some drama , some love , some life experiences . great book .
a good study of the basics and connections between islam and christianity . we used this for a group study at our church ,
i love the storyline and twists and turns it takes but i love the fact that this power couple can manage to put work on the shelf and just be together .
i have to say this book was some what predictable but fun never the less . i liked the & # 34 ; drama & # 34 ; surrounding the characters involved in the wedding .
some twists and turns here . and some great surprises . i have n't read one of his books that has n't been really hard to put down . waiting for the next one ! ... ... ...

i can not wait for the next installment . but of course i have to , the only thing i do n't like about this series is i have to wait : (
so very sad to think life for some exist as shown in this book . box of tissues required during this read .
lisa gardner is one of my favorites . i 've read them all and she has yet to let me down ! she always keeps you hanging until the very end . loved it !
i read this book in two hours . i could n't put it down . the author keeps you at the edge of your seat . i have read part 1 & 2. it is worth your money .
weak story not very interesting , very repetitious in need of serious editing . there are many better books in this genre .
this was my first book by this author and i loved it . i do plan on buying more of this author 's books .
again , character development is great . i like the young and old character mix as well . great stories , and very entertaining .
great book loved the story line hated the ending total cliff hanger probably the biggest cliff hanger ever but still worth it
simply amazing , indeed ; this book was just that ! i thoroughly enjoyed this `` prequel '' and ca n't wait to read the rest !
this was a very good story . i really enjoyed it . i have n't read many of her books , but will definitely look for more now .
this book was a rather good story and you will probably enjoy reading it . it is a western love story .
book started very slow ... too much information on the characters . was about to give up and the story got very interesting . could not put book down . glad i kept reading .
just finished reading `` ghost house '' and i have to say this was not my favorite ghost house story . it was an ok read . probably a better book for younger people .
the story line was great . but i felt like the author rushed through . if it looking for a quick read it 's great ! !
i really enjoy these books . it is fast paced action that hooks you in right away . the authors create a rich and believable world . i look forward to reading more .
great illustrations ! but where is text ? ? disappointing to find three words in the whole book , where the story has potential ( (
i liked the book because it is sort of funny and has many morals and i can use them in real life .
i thought the book was very well researched and quite informative . i was glad to add it to my collection .
keeps you in suspense to a point . i feel like i am in the book with the characters . the amish life is fascinating .
oh the surprise of the characters of this book . get this for book club and challenge everyone on why they would do in the shoes of each of the characters ! truly enjoyable
do n't waste your time with a short written opinion with no credible references . this last words were required in the review window ... but the read is not even worth them .
it is so amazing , and i 'm so happy that you had it on here , because i love this book so much
very interesting storyline . could n't put the 1st book down . 3rd book was not as captivating but brought the story full circle .
this was a great little book to read and the transaction was so smooth and easy , would buy from again !
if you looking for drama , drama , drama ... this is what you want ! from beginning to the end this story left me speechless .
there was n't really much to the story . it was okay , but i was n't all that impressed by it . good for a quick read .
so funny , from a time we will never see again when the pace of live was slow and the add man had not convinced every one you were nothing if you did n't use this or own that .
good read better than the movie . ca n't wait to read wait to read the rest of the books thanks for the book .
i liked the plain language that gave me a real idea of what i was doing and could expect . thank you .
the type of writing that made john grisham a world class author . when i see a john grisham book , i always purchase it immediately . this is one of his better stories .
this book is absolutely wonderful . it 's everything that i was looking for in order to learn more . thank you so much .

brilliant story , thoroughly enjoyed reading torn and would definitely recommend it to anyone i know ! love both logan and drake ! enjoy !
good , little known dr. seuss book written for adults ! what can i say about dr. seuss ... who does n't like his books !
this book was a wonderful surprise ! i happened upon it late one night and could n't stop reading it . a little slow here and there , but definitely worth reading .
other short book but i fell in love with it anyway . it is worth the money but i just wish it were a full book .
ok , just a short review , i love love love loved this darn book ! ! ! ca n't wait for the next one ! ! ! great job tina ! ! !
i thought this would be too cheesy initially but ended up being really moved . it really explores the depth of relationships and people which is not always pretty . even non pet lovers should read this book .
i have always loved readers digest so when i discovered this ebook for my kindle i was extremely pleased . a great read and was happy to discover it was a full length book .
solid plot with excellent character development - one of his better efforts of late . worth your time and precious money !
very good ! ! very suspenseful right from the start it was so good that i had to read the second book .
boring did not enjoy to slow uninteresting could n't picture story line would not read the series could n't keep my attention
some of the side plots were a little too detailed and made the story drag out and at times just slow .
if you love mini stories this is the book for you ! i f you enjoy knowing the start and the end of good story before you go to bed then this book is highly recommended .
i am not into the fairy and witch aspect of life . it was an interesting story for a change , but i would not read another . just not my world or interest .

if you like fantasy , you 'll love this book ... and the whole series ! raising dragons is a great start to an outstanding series ! !
good book . holds your interest and easy read , i am on book five and the story is going well . i recommend it for all dragon lovers of all ages
well written and easy to read . good series for a first time reader or long time sci-fi fan with plausible characters and action .
a good read young adults who are in to the series a little slow to start but a fairly good read altogether
this book looked at things in a different way than i had previously considered . i would recommend it to any of my thinking friends .
i really like the series , i havent read this book yet but i am sure it will be just as great as the first one
the book was interesting but a bit too far out there for me . the pictures were something new . i wish i could put the number of stars without writing an entire review .
great story line . this is a book that i could n't put down . well defined and interesting characters . the unexpected twist at the end caught me off guard . i thoroughly enjoyed this read .

the human spirit fights so hard for not just the next breath but a connection . this is a stunning book with beautiful imagery . loved it . will even read it again .
very nice kindle book . i view it on my computer to make following instructions a little more readable , and in color , too .
i am still reading it . it has its good parts and bad parts , but it is still very good . i might read the rest of the series .
so far i have loved every one of the books in this series ! hard to put down .
a very good and interesting book kept you wanting to find out what happened next kept your interest through out the book
the pace was slow and the story just boring ! this was not a good read . not even a little bit captivating . i was quite disappointed .
it 's a tried and true formula , but works . : - ) ) i like this author 's style and look forward to reading more .
what a super fast read ! very interesting look at the differences in folks and how one might see themselves , even if `` out there '' . will look for more by this author .
i have almost finished reading this book . i find it fascinating and very educational .
read it now kids before they make you read it in school , things are always better when you want to do something rather than having someone make you do something . enjoy this fine read .
this held my attention enough to complete the book , barely . far fetched would best describe this novel . if you are into fantasy , it should satisfy your needs .
alan young comes across as a wonderfully kind man , and his memories of life in show business are quite enjoyable !
love her books and i have been buying and reading all her brady series , which are wonderful , i recommend this one .
a lot of clues to hold you but not enough for you to solve until the very end . if you like to try and figure it out this will keep you guessing .
maybe it is not my style . i had to make myself finish the book , and that is not the way to enjoy a book .
our bible . it 's thick but amazingly thorough and complete . we keep it with us in the front seat and turn to it when we cross the state line . make sure you have the latest .
absolutely loved this book . you always seemed to be looking for the next twist in the story . i definitely want to read more of this author .
i do n't usually order the workbook with my bible study things but i did for this and it has been great
love this series of books about harry hole . sad to see that he is gone - wonder what is next ? ? ? ?

for this avid readers of suspense thrillers i can say this book actually scared me ( in a good way ! ) wow !
i enjoyed this book . i think it has to be one of the best of the series . i ca n't wait until next year to find out what 's going to happen next .
deadly deception was a very good read . i 've become a fan forever . i am looking forward to the third book which i 'm starting right now !
a nice read , and a few laughs . a very positive story line with a rather `` unique '' way to deliver it .
teenagers can be difficult to raise because their minds tell them that they are ready for the world ! this book greatly helped me get closer to my daughter ! five stars !
this author ca n't be beat . the illustrations and text make this song come alive . we enjoyed this purchase very very much !
really enjoyed this book have them all but the new one coming out in 2013 ca n't wait . love these type of books
does not flow well , just not an easy read . totally interesting ! but glad i read it just the same ! interesting in a historical sense .
these simple but interesting stories are just right for a quiet time to relax i enjoy them very much and have 2 more to read
very entertaining reading . some of the references did seem a bit dated though . however still a good read at anytime .
i really like this book . the recipes in it are very easy , fun and healthy . i have tried several of them and they are all very tasty too .
totally useless information that has n't been said nor known for ages . not even worth opening the book . save yourself the time .
as usual , mr baldacci writes a great novel . it is full of action and suspense and you never know what is coming next . always great reads from this author .
an excellent adventure mystery with a touch of science fiction . could this really happen ? it seems very likely . believable characters and story line . a must read for anyone who thinks and dreams .
catching fire is a logical follow up to the hunger games . anyone that has read the hunger games must read this book
great book . i wish there was more to the ending . i feel that the author just left me hang in suspence .
i loved this one . it was heart wrenching , romantic , and fun ! i read it in a day , it was that good !
this was the second time around for me and this book . jd robb was the best in the beginning with these books ( series ) . i wanted to start the series over but on my kindle .
a story set in two times that while easy to read provided nothing compelling to ponder .
i already own hardback and wanted a kindle version . very happy . stephen king novels generally make me happy . loved it .
wow ! never expected the ending to be what it was . the book held my interest to the very end . and the end - wow again !
although i was hoping this would start where the short game left off , i was n't too disappointed . i was again left anxious to find out what will happen next . good read
it 's worth the read , and it was n't very expensive . i do n't want to give the whole thing away but it has good morals to it .
i loved the book and have read quite a few of this author 's books . it is worth taking the time to read in my opinion .
this was a awesome love story . i cant wait to read the next one . there needs to be more men like drake
a very cute love story of friends who discover more than friendship after all these years , a great read , hope there is a part 2 .
this trilogy by nora roberts was great . i would recommend these books to everyone . if you are a fan of hers , you will love reading this series .
great suspense and chilling epilogue . a must read cop story ! an ending that will make you feel like love is all that matters .
the suspense and catching scenarios enchanting story wants me to read it all over and over again it is so great
the first book ends and picks right up with the second in this series . i could not put either book down . hoping the third book comes out soon ! really loved it : )
this book held me captive from the moment i began reading . i could not stop . i had to know what was happening next . well written romance that pulls on your every emotion . highly recommend
the first few weeks are very tough but stick with it and you 'll see the results you 're looking for .
i felt that the sequel was even better than the first read . it had non-stop action from the beginning to the end . i loved it and would recommend the both books to avid readers .
all of the drama in the novel is packed into the last 30 pages . the rest of the book is incredibly dull .
most of the short stories were were well written , with clever twists and endings . this is the first one i have read , and look forward to reading more .
i love addison moore 's books . this one in particular i had a difficult time putting down and was greatly looking forward to the next in the series !
as always , a great read ! love the characters and how you make it all come together . ca n't wait for the next one !
this is truly a very interesting story with twists that you do n't expect . a very good book ... .i highly recommend it .
that 's all i can think to write - dumb . one of those books you keep reading , knowing it has to get better , well , it did n't get better .
this book has a great story line . the characters are easy to get to know . the only thing i did n't like was that it is a cliffhanger . now i have to get book two .
this book is beautifully written and impossible to put down ! a truly unique story with many important lessons to be learned within its pages .
in truth , i have not started reading this book yet as i am reading another one . however , i have enjoyed his other books and looking forward to this one .
i love the book and it so easy reading and the author made it so clear from the bible 's point of view . i recommended this book to anyone who need healing .
i hope this will become required reading for all middle school kids , not to mention all teachers in all schools asap .
really enjoyed this book . difficult to put down . a book that grabs you in the first chapter and keeps your attention all the way until the last page are the best .
even though i knew ahead of time , i can definitely tell that a teenager wrote that but the story is still very amazing all the same .
could n't put the book down , i found myself jumping into bed at the kids ' bedtime so i could read but staying up late to continue reading . finished in just a few days , great book !
i purchased this for my grandkids and so enjoy reading it to them . would recommend this to anyone especially teachers
good book . easy to read . no gross graphic content or profanity . i enjoy mysteries that are not graphic with blood and gore .

definately recommend this book for all levels of spanish . i do wish they it came in a large print edition . this is a must have .
after reading the first book i decided to find out more about these characters and their land . i 'm glad i did . onto the next book !
favorite authors brought together in a good holiday read ... the theme is a good one . the stories are short , interesting , endings curious but predictable .
the story flowed and was easy to read . i finished in a rainy afternoon . great story . will read more books by this author .
could n't put it down once i started reading . i ca n't wait for the next one . love to read ongoing saga
i liked this book a lot , read through it quickly . i will probably read the other books as well to see what happens with the sisters .
i cried the entire time i read this book . this is one of those books that should made into a movie .
why do they make you write a certain number of words for a review ? 6 more words required . two more ... .
i am ready for the others to be written now . i just hope i do n't forget what i have read in all the other ones by the time the last ones are published .
this was a great read . i found myself laughing and crying several times through out this book . highly recommend this book !
received this book very quickly and in great condition . it is full of good and helpful information . a good book to own .
good read and entertaining real life stories and lessons learned and shared . would have liked to see some photos along the way
did not like the ending . she ended up with the wrong man ... the storyline for this book was not as good or exciting as the previous ones .
great to read ! ! ! i want to thank amazon very much , it 's easy to read and the author is very good
another great book by daniel silva . i have read all 15 of his books and have never enjoyed reading any more than i do his books . the price is great too .
i 'm delighted that this man had the courage to tell it like it is . the american people need to know if they are brave enough to read it .
i have long been an avid stuart woods fan . i 've read all of his books and continue to look forward to the next one .
this was a great read ! hard to put down , it had it all ! suspense , romance , mystery ! i thoroughly enjoyed ! i will be looking for more from this author !
this book was helpful in that it offered instructions on how to do some things . i found it just a little bit hard to follow .
warning : once you start you will not be able stop ... found this series by mistake and so glad i did ! it is definitely worth the time .
this is not the type of book that i usually read but this is really good . the characters are so believable and the ending is unpredictable and unexpected . good read .
i enjoyed this book very much . i was drawn in quickly and finished in a few days . emotional at times but heartwarming throughout .
i have actually read this book several times and have never become bored ! it is a great story ! ! ! ! i am sure that i will read it again ! ! !
i like this . item promptly delivered in new n original condition . greatly recommended . besides the book is worth reading and it was change your perspective altogether .
this graphic novel was intense . frank miller brings sales to the batman world . it 's dark , and twisted and not for everyone . i ca n't wait to read the sequel .
i started to read it cause i wanted a good cry . i really like these kids and their sad and funny story .
i could n't put it down from the moment i started til the end . anyone would enjoy it . it makes you want to read the next one .
the content is good . photos and information are all very well done and useful . but , after only two weeks of light use the binding is breaking and the pages will soon be falling out .
truly one of the best books i have ever read . the story content flows and is so well written that this book should be required reading for anyone who loves to read .
i enjoyed reading this book . it was easy to understand . i have been practicing divine healing myself and have used similar approach when i meet people in the streets who need healing .
i already read it once through and now i am reading it again . i am having a tough time with it though .
another terrific addition to another one of liz 's books . nice in depth look into these bad girls ! liz just really makes you want to learn all you can about these very important women from the bible !
the entire series was great . best vampire books i have read as they were very different than others . could not stop reading them . very sexual
it was okay , it focus on the set of characters and i would like to read the others book by this author .
a romance at holiday time . it flows and is an easy read that makes you smile and know how our emotions light up the tree .
great summer read and sure to have a great discussion with it ! although tough to get a food theme going .
this is my kind of history - accurate , well written and i learned about a time and country that i did not know well . i am enjoying this read .
this book delivered a concept that i had not heard of before and because i enjoy historical novels it definately kept my interest .
although some of the situations and happenings are pretty far-fetched , i really enjoyed z and am now planning to read the earlier books in the riley series .
interesting . did n't keep my attention like the others they have written , but i would recommend it . these writers are well worth reading anything they write .
i really enjoyed the way the story developed and came to an almost predictable ending . i felt as if i was right there watching the relationship mature .
excellent beginning to what i 'm sure will be another awesome story . ca n't wait for the next chapter . way to go michael
it was a bit far-fetched but i still liked it . rowling writes good characters , the story in this one was a bit slow and the resolution of the plot kind of unbelievable .
very talented author . this is a wonderful story you wo n't want to put down . i did n't want the story to end .
interesting , fast moving , lots of things happening , all set in a previous century with the added spice of time travel
so close to getting the whole story but not quite yet ! brilliant ! have to read the next one ... really good read .
i did n't set out to find a paleo recipe book , but some of these recipes sounded so good i could n't resist . i was n't disappointed . one good item after another . definitely worth buying !
this is the third book i 've read by this author and i 'm hooked ! i ca n't wait to read the next one .
this was really cute ! this is the sequel to she 's got ta be mine . there were some really quirky characters in this one . the rest home for former ladies of the night was a hoot !
it made for a nice adventure , but really ? nobody is going to call the police when this happens , really ? not
the book was pretty cool . in the beginning it was a bit slow but it caught up and got exciting . i would like to read the other books to see what happens .
wonderful short story , and i am a bay area native so i really enjoyed reading this story . no sex or violence , just grown people having a problem and solving it . highly recommend this book .
as stated , not for the faint of heart . this book does included graphic violence but it is necessary to the plot . i was totally engrossed from the first chapter to the last sentence .
the story is on the predictable side but fun . i like that it goes between the past and present day . not great but good and it was fun .
this was a fast paced book that kept my attention until the very end . well done . i am looking forward to reading more books from this author .
i liked this book but i had trouble putting it into practice . i think i 'll have to go back to try reading it again . getting things done helped me a lot more .
love love loved it ! i ca n't wait to read the next book ! hopefully it is as good as the first one ! amazing author !
weak and predictable storyline . characters were silly and unrealistic . junior high reading level . i do not recommend wasting your time .
loved this book , i am half way through the second in the series , and it is just as good as the first ! ! can recommend it !
great book ! i got involved in the characters ' lives . it was so much fun to read . highly required by me .
great for anyone who always ends up feeling , when relationships end , like she has given too much , including perhaps her own identity , and ended up with nothing . i highly recommend it !
really enjoyed this book . it was believable and the spiritual message is a good one without overwhelming the plot . anxious to read other books by karen young .
i loved it ! a very interesting novel . very well done and i would recommend it to anyone who enjoys romance novels .
it took me a while to get used to the writing style but once there i was hooked . i did enjoy the story and had not worked out the ending at all . an enjoyable read .
good books , good stories for each . they are each from a trilogy or series , which then makes you want to find the others to read . i prefer to read complete trilogy / series .
i guess the best thing about this book is that it is written from a man 's perspective on dealing with babies . it was actually quite annoying to read every book as written for the mother .
this little book is a hoot , and really an introduction to her other writing ... and it worked , as reading this will drive me to reading much more of her work . do n't miss this one .
i found this book to be repetitious and not worthy of its subject . it was heartwarming to read about someone who never gave up .
just like the rest of the books in this series i loved this book it did not disappoint and i ca n't wait for the next ones to come i am hooked and this series is my drug
what a great way to spend a sunday afternoon . good writing . good story . took me a little bit to get into but the pay off was worth it . thanks so much !
this was a book that is very hard to put down once you got started . highly recommend for any scifi buff
good story overall . took awhile to wrap up at the end . lots of plot lines to to connect and keep straight .
the beginning of the series sets up the history of the time and introduces us to his fabulous character . there is interest in history , humor and intrigue . i really enjoyed this book .
the books keep getting better and better , i 've already bought the fifth book to start reading and i ca n't wait .
i thought for the most part that this book was good . the only thing i did n't like was that the ending was kind of abrupt .
the tongue can do great damage even among friends . this book has given me a new way of thinking before speaking .
west has a way of making the characters come alive . this book is a page turner just like his others .
these books are great if your looking for something fun and kinda drawn out to read . it will take forever for you to get somewhere in these novels but they are fun .
politics can get very intense and too personal . some people get wrapped up in the wrong aspects of the political war . for some , the answer is murder . for others , the answer is multiple murder .
the kids love them and i enjoy reading them to the children . the books have puzzles and action and a moral . i think they are a great value ... ...
i absolutely loved this book ... i recommend reading down to you then up to me ... i ca n't wait for book three to be released ! ! !
tired of all the supernatural . but this one was good . hints of it , but not the major topic . good love story . a great beach read .
great book , part of a wonderful trilogy , amazing dystopian series and you get very attached to the heroes , fun read and read them all ! loved this book
bought the book as a christmas gift . kids said they enjoyed the book and it 's an addition to the series for them .
the story was much better than i had expected ! very believable situations and had a really good ending . i would buy more books from this author .
my kids live this story . it shows to not judge before you known at you are dealing with . not every monster is bad .
i love this version of the bible because of the way it reads - like a novel . more easily understandable .
this is n't what i expected from reading about it . i expected more of a journey on how she over came her grief and moved on . i did n't even finish and probably wo n't .
a fitting sequel for the first two books . goes at a thriller pace , but unlike usual thrillers , there is a message in every chapter .
if you plan on reading this you better have a strong stomach and a good sense of humor . it 's not a good lunch read in other words do n't eat while reading this book ! !
i found this one the best read of the 3 in the series . a little more depth and character development .
really enjoyed this book . so looking forward to shades story i think that one will be the best one of the series
married by mistake have not received to read , i can not rate this product if not received to do so .
i enjoyed the character development , the plot , imagery , and , especially the proper use of the english language . i have read all three in the series , and i look forward to the new release .
what a ride . from beginning to end this story is all action . kept me interested and did n't want to put it down .
a very good book that i could not put down . i hope the rest of the series is this good .
this book is a very touching story for any grandmother to leave to a grandchild . it should be carried over to all generations . i enjoyed it very much .
loved this book ! a must read for anyone in the art world . it is one of those books you ca n't put down .
love the awkward family photos book and this awkward family pet photos book is just as funny . highly recommend for purchase !
i was on the edge of my seat waiting to see if she chose the right man . glad to see the witch got her due .
good directions ; however , she could have offered more artwork to learn by .
i purchased this book thinking this might be an ok fluff read . but surprisingly i really like this book ! the characters are well written and entertaining , i 'm definitely going to be watching this author !
very concise booklet with very basic but important information regarding photography . it may be used for quick reference on tablet .
good read . very anxious for the next part of the story . i would recommend this book to anyone . hang in there with the language , it gets better .
this book was so good i finished it in two day . i am not big on religion books but i have to say i really enjoyed this book .
returned it because i had already read ready for romance . got a credit & just purchased ready for marriage . thoroughly enjoyed both stories .
still very sad but a great book also ! i can ` t wait for the next book . i wonder what its going to be about
i did not care for the style of the book and could n't even finish it .
i could not put this book down ! if you like christian romance , suspense , and happy endings , this book is for you !
just loved it could not guess who was the murder . had some late late nights as could not put it down
i read the entire series . it had a good plot line and good characters that made you want to continue till you read them all .
if i had come up with the idea 40 or 50 years ago the world would be on a better path than all this greed . washington dc would be a place where something can get done .
these authors never fail to deliver . great every time i read it . i love the holiday collections . a great way to enjoy time off work !
thats really all i can say . the book was ok. i really did n't enjoy it as much as the drake sister 's novels .
this is a wonderful and realistic ending to the trilogy . i love how this story follows the couple into their old age .
wow . have to say the best i have read in awhile . really enjoyed the story from start to finish . i will be telling others about this book . totally enjoyed everything about the story .
i do n't know what other reviewers are talking about this was a very very good book i read it in 2 days
i finished this book in a matter of hours . i could not put it down . ca n't wait to read the second ! !
about halfway thru it currently and cant wait to finish reading it to get to the third book in the series .
i bought this book because it is required reading in my english class . i am enjoying the book very much .
read a couple fully and the rest i skipped . just not my type of books as i do not care for bad language and a few other things contained in these books .
another awesome story ! ca n't wait for the next one ! ! ! i am so in love with all of susan 's books . i am slowly but surely adding all her older books onto my kindle
i love a good mystery and this one really fits the bill . this was my first one by the author , but surely not the last .
i do not remember much of the book , so that tells me it was n't bad , but not good either . i am just catching up on my reviews as i have been very busy .
unfortunately this important information is boring . the repetitive information in each section makes it a difficult read . has not helped me at all .
she is a great writer and her books are always a great read and no nasty words it them . just the best .
i have realy enjoyed reading the dresden files and look forward to reading th next title . i have told my friends about the series
excellent series of books . could not wait to get the next one . loved the way it just kept making you want more of the story .
i was n't impressed with this book - too boring and drawn out - this was my first kindle book i deleted .
i really loved and enjoyed this book . such a great series and the characters are just so lovable and easy to fall in love with . cant wait to read the rest of the series .
again , these characters are so believable you can really get into the storylines . i am glad i discovered this author - she is definitely on the top of my lists now .
could n't even finish it . it was that bad . all alex did was cry all the time . nothing ever developed in the story
this is a really great author . i keep getting caught up in these books and do not want to put them down .
i love this book ! it could have a few dead parts but overall very good , keeps u on your toes !
loved the series and the element of mystery and romance ! the dynamic between the friends of sky high is one that anybody would have to have in their lives .
i 've read a lot of parenting books and this is one i strongly recommend . the advice is simple and sound and relatively easy to implement . give it a try !
second book of her trilogy , had me hooked on reading until the very last page . hate waiting so long , but it seems spirit of the wolves ca n't come soon enough !
love the book ! ! ! ! ! ! ca n't wait until the next one comes out . my first time reading a book on kindle fire .

good book , ca n't wait for book seven . nice series . have to keep reading to find out what happens . thanks for writing . enjoy your books
if this book with its information does n't wake you up to the facts of what we 're doing to the planet , nothing will !
a wicked psychological suspense thriller ! it will keep you reading long into the night . i did n't like the ending though .
i 'm a big j.d . robb fan and i really like the in death series . this one is not a five star effort like some of the others but it 's still a really good book .
i have read alot of parker books and enjoy them alot . his characters are very real and it is always a good story
as good as the previous dozen . same guy different stage . if you like any one of the books you will like them all .
this book was ok however , it was good for the price free . it 's nice to look at a book first before you buy it .
this book is a very good read . it was entertaining and romantic . i would recommend it to anyone to read !

this book holds your interest and keeps you coming back at every spare minute to read more . and the ending , wow , i never saw that coming ! good book !
it was a good book and pleased with the ending . moral of the story . do n't settle for less than what you truly deserve and desire .
did not like this book . it looked very interesting but , there were too many characters & could not keep up with them .
wonderfully written , taken at face value of a great quest and it 's exciting ending . i mixed it with the movies to keep the faces fresh .

the book came in great shape . i have not read it yet , but am looking forward to in the next week or so .
this is a great children 's story . the author does a wonderful job at entertaining while teaching a lesson at the same time .
they 've all got excellent plots and characters , but romantic comedy and mystery combined ! great reading anything from evanovich !
the books in this series are just a retelling of the same story . redundant , sappy and after book 1 , they got really boring . i felt like the author got lazy .
jack higgins is up to his expected standard in this book . difficult to put down until you reach the end .
i could not put it down ! just as good as the first one ! ! ca n't wait to start # 3 ! starting now !

this is the same lovely story i was read as a child and now get to share with my children . love little golden books !
this is my favorite book out of the series so far . i ca n't wait for the next book to come out .
entertaining story about the vietnam conflict , nice character development and story line . hard to put down . while the title leads you to believe it is all air force , also includes special forces .
this was an excellent book and not just for racing fans . it has a good story line . i recommend this book for everyone especially teen boys .
i found the book to be pretty good and i am looking forward to reading the next book ! i am thinking that i will be sad when i get to the end ! : (
could have been a great story , but the lack of editing ruined it . there is a lot of steam between the main characters and a good plot . just wish the errors were not so distracting .
i found this book a good addition to the other books i have on this topic . there are other books on this topic i would rate a 5 rather than 4 though .
what an awesome book ! i read this book in one day . i ca n't wait for the next book to come .

really enjoyed this one . a good romance with some action . not loaded with sex which was refreshing . interesting characters . a good read . i do recommend .
there is all kinds of truth in the book and wonderful lessons to be learned . i would read it again .
it 's an inspiring and concise book , giving a lot of insight into what we should really worry about and what not to .
this book was a complete surprise . pulled me in and would not let me go . even though it was a bit slow at times it still kept me interested to see how it would end .
my grandson ordered # 1 & # 5 in the series . i filled in the other ones . he is reading # 2 right now & loves this author .
very nice story of god and how he gives people hope in strength . even in terrible situations . heart touching and heart breaking at times .
this was a really great book ! plus side gal finding her happy ever after ! ! it really makes you remember how important communication is in a marriage !
chapters are too long but it is a good book . i like the twist of good vs evil even in ourselves
love anything ted dekker writes , after reading this had to read more from carl as well ! very courageous ! i could n't have done what they did !
this is a 3 year project we started 3 weeks ago ... it 's a little early to tell but it 's been great so far ...
good read not the ending i was expecting . but it was a good read non the less ! fun fun book !

loves the first book the second one was even more amazing this story was fantastic an amazing read for sure
this is a strange read but it was good . it combines the feel of old literature into a new read .
very deep and entertaining book . well written and enlightening . i would highly recommend this book to anyone who is or knows any kind of a survivor .
book was okay . i would recommend to others . i have read better , but worth reading . i am glad i took the time to read .
very juvenile . characters are not developed well and lack depth and personality . way too much about fashion and shopping . more plot development needed .
this book has the element of surprise , i would 've never guessed all of that . truly amazing book , bravo to the writer
love your books ! ! ! ! i think i have read them all , but keep them coming , i will read them . thank you !

a funny and book . good reading and i was surprised by the ending and that is all i am saying because i do n't want to mess it up for others .
this is a very good novel like all his books . this is an exciting novel . i would go and get it .
well-written . pictures and diagrams along with ideas for using different stitches very helpful . i have enjoyed planning my next projects that will use this book . would purchase again . recommend it .
i think the first book was much better but this book is still very good . if you like douglas adams than you will like this book .
it 's a good novel with new enemies and also a good ending that takes the reader into a great world hidden into plain sight .
heartwarming and uplifting , it has much to teach on many levels . gets to the heart of what teaching really means .
i guess in this case it took a community to save a child . but also very beneficial to them as well . loved the story . thought it very encouraging .
would have been better without the erotica . always enjoy the vampire but really ... the graphic descriptions would be better left to the imagination .
i liked the book because the characters developed during the story . there was a lot of emotional development . guy saves girl then falls in love .
the story is good but the book ends funny . then you have to wait for the next series . i 'm getting tired of the short books .
i really enjoyed this book . it turned out to be better than i originally thought . thanks for this love story .
a fun story that kept my interest . not quite as inspiring or motivating as i had hoped but a great ending .
i could n't even finish this book , it just didnt make any sense to me . i would not recommend this to anyone else .
better than the movie ! ! ! ! i could not put this book down !
great erotic read . the plot has numerous twist and turns but in the end it makes a steamy bedtime story .
this is a must read for anyone who enjoys legal suspense . it 's also written around a very unique law subject .
please read this remarkable , rich true story ... could be life changing ! it will inspire you to make your own life more meaningful ...
this novel kept me reading . i loved the surprise ending . i just knew i had it figured out & them wow , total surprise ending . i 'm going to purchase more of her crime novels !
child 's book our grandson really enjoys this book series . he loves to read them and ca n't wait to get to the next one in the series .
i thought this would be funny and more interesting than it was but it just seemed to become redundant . i grew bored with penny 's experiences and stopped reading the book before i got even half way through .
the author is dead on in his topic . this book should be required reading for all college students , every where .
it was a bit slow to get started , but then it 's hard to put down . as a history fan , i loved it ! ! !
i enjoyed reading this book . but it was very sad to read and knowing this really goes on in our world and parents allow this to happen to they 're own child is just heartbreaking
tons of info and easy to follow instructions . we have had amazing results with what we 've tried . highly recommend .
a great book . it really does make you laugh out loud . does a great job of helping to put things in perspective .
great reference book and devotional in many ways . i have used for foundation work in many bible classes . excellent and easy to read and use .
this book is full of facts which i had never heard before . i have passed the book on and when i get it back i will read it again . very entertaining .
this was an interesting read with a nice plot twist towards the end . a little unbelievable as to one of the characters , otherwise very well written .
the cards are colorful , detailed , and beautifully illustrated . i am very pleased with my purchase and i would recommend this deck to anyone who loves cats ! ! !
i have finished this for a history club . this bio answered a lot of questions about president wilson that i had . he still puzzles me , but not lack of information any more .
great characters and story line . a hot and steamy romance with some suspense thrown in . i would definitely recommend this book .
i have already made at least five of the recipes ... all are really good ! clear directions and really helps me with meal planning !
i enjoyed two books by this author and will be getting more from her , this was a light love story and a good book for a summer read .
i did n't know until the last page which guy would be hers . well written . not typical format but that kept me reading .
i was not anticipating the ending of this story . going through every day life with them was far different than my non jewish life and sometimes it was painful . i appreciate knowing about the author 's experience .
this is a wonderful series to read . if you love a strong woman and historic settings . this is a must read .
and my girl loves it , she is very happy with this book , she loves all the details on every page
a wonderful addition to the series , hoping there is more to come . i think this may have been my favorite in the series .
it kept me guessing until the end and then some . it kept the pages turning well into the night and i will definitely be reading the next in the series .
a cute and charming tale . leaves you hanging in anticipation of the next book . a good rainy day read . charming .
i highly recommend this book to anyone that loves a beautiful but sad love story ! it had me in tears almost the entire book ! go ahead and purchase it , you will not regret it ! ! !
i did n't want this story to end ! what an awesome book ! we need a sequel ! sexy and entertaining ! ! ! !
great set for great price . listed in wrong genre i think . i enjoyed reading all of it and would recommend it
i liked this book , i enjoy this topic alpha male saves the day type books . i would recommend , my complaint would be its to short read it in a few hours .
not feeling this book . not sure if it 's to slow or what . i will continue to read not sure that i will purchase the other series of these book s .
nice story with a nice ending . it was an easy book to get into . i will be looking forward to the next one of the series .
picked it up and could n't put it down ! great story line , keeps you entertained from start to finish . highly recommend !
i received so much positive hype about the book before reading it , i felt a little let down . i will want to read the sequel .
i have really loved all her books , and ca n't wait for more , she is wonderful and makes you want to read
so far it 's the best in the series . you have to love megan and jack and their determination to survive .
book was just as advertised ; book was just as advertised ; book was just as it was advertised ; the word requirement is stupid .
is awesome . this is an amazing book with an amazing concept . even if you do n't run your own business , this has some basics for life that is very applicable .
has the sound of a true story by someone who experienced it , but left me wanting more . i did enjoy it , though .
first book i 've read by this author , and i thought the book was really really good . have to get more books by her .
in each story the way it is written you can feel like you are riding along . i know he is retired now , he put his years in . keep writing books and i will keep reading them .
i have read diane 's other books as well and have loved them all so far ! ca n't wait for the latest !
would gladly give more stars if i could . absolutely love this book series and am always impatiently awaiting the next one !
story was fine but all the grammatical errors , weird sentence structure and extra words that made no sense were really confusing and annoying . she needs a better proof reader .
a little too bizarre for me . i do n't mind violence and strange characters but i felt so sorry for the birds .
this book provides a different angle in conspiracy theories . it is a good book which keeps the reader drawn in and on edge , well written and overall a good adventure .
enjoys every minute i was reading , great story , would want my 10 year old granddaughter to read it , will get her the book ! !
very real , very touching and compelling read . death and love go together well in this book . a true must read . people are flawed ( which i like ) and makes it more realistic .
this is another great book by john grisham . i loved the characters and the story of baseball . it is sad at times , happy at times and humorous too .
i really enjoyed this novel . i flew through it . the characters were believable . i would definitely read more from this author .
it is a an easy & great read . i really liked it . know it is a short book ... not really long .
this book has been a great help to me , and has inspired me to be a little more adventurous with my knitting !
an exciting and suspenseful read . i like it better than the first two books . i reccomend for ages 12 and up .
good story line -- perhaps a bit rushed at the end . could have used stronger character development for the main players - i did n't feel i really knew them .
this was a great set of books . i enjoyed them very much and look forward to seeing the next movie
i really enjoyed this book but it moved too fast and was a little short for me . but a great story .
this book has some great patterns and ideas . the patterns look easy to follow and will add fun to any project . i have used a couple and they look great
what an interesting read ! definitely a good read for african american women whose thought about dating out of their race .
listen everyone . i really really enjoyed this book . you have to read it . it is very interesting . i could not put the book done sometimes . this book is really worth the purchase .
i just discovered this author and i love her ! there is always a wonderful story and a final twist that keeps you interested in the book all the way through .
there is n't much more to say ! he 's hot , brooke 's hot & this is a must read book ! what are you waiting for ? !
the continuity of the 5 volumes was wonderful - picked up where you left off in the previous volume - great !
cute plot . took a while to get it going , but not a bad read once you got into it . i would recommend for a simple saturday afternoon .
overall this was a great set of stories . i did however find a lot of mistakes , which through me off at times , but i still enjoyed it .
this was just ok. bit slow moving & had to force myself to keep going sometimes , but i did finish it . not quite sure what the problem was - it just did n't grab me .
have read all his books and by far i rate this as his best yet . was thrilling from beginning to the end .
this is a well written action filled book . christine warren as usual gives us a fun and adventurous couple hours of quality entertainment
i took great joy in reading this book to my child . it is a timeless classic that is fun to read ! definitely recommended ! ! ! ! !
the couple had a romance and experienced love . it was very interesting , but they only experienced what could be . t ended too soon .
wow ! ! ! ! what an amazing story ! ! ! you should read this is a crazy awesome story i could n't put it down totally blew my mind !
not a story , but a lot of lines that men give to women about how they pick them up . sorry , just did n't care for this type book .
great story would recommend . i really enjoyed the story . i choose this rating because it is something that i would read again .
this graphic novel is creative and well written . the style is believable including the illustrations . the main character is relatable and funny .
sexy story that i did n't want to end . i enjoyed the characters and it was just enough to be satisfied .
i really enjoyed this book . it was an interesting mystery with lots of twists and turns . i will definitely be reading more by this author .
there are so many different twists and turns to this story . it keeps you turning the pages great story teller .
mrs wright does a great job of blending history , romance , and the storyline . she is by far one of the outstanding authors of all times . a definite must read .
what a hilarious ending to a great series ! ! ! i loved every minute of it . the only bad part is that it is the end . i will miss these loveable characters .
i do n't even know where to start . i loved this book ! ! the character 's were great ! it has been two weeks since i read chase and i am still talking about it .
concise and extremely helpful . will probably even buy a paper copy just so i always have the tips with me .
i loved this book it was amazing and i couldnt put it down . i really recommend this book to all people . just awesome !
it was a good read and a quiet read . did not best around the bush . i would recommend this book and am planning on reading book # 2 as soon as possible .
i really enjoyed this short . the story is pretty dark , but i like dark . and i love the twist at the end .
fun , easy read that has you craving chocolate the first few pages into it , but by end of book , you 've satisfied the craving with the character 's stories .
i hate to say it but i had this book for about a year and am now just reading it . it 's a good book and story line i really enjoyed it
i have not had time to read the entire book but have looked up several things that had good ideas .
this is a great book so far . unfortunately , i have n't read the whole thing . but the bit i have read is exactly what i have been looking for .
helped add more meat to the series but was to short but then again i love very very long books .
i bought this as a gift for my wife . she loves this and reads some almost daily . happy , happy , happy .
in my library , i have a large collection of native american skills in various styles . having added this volume to my e-book collection is a good addition . i recommend this to anyone s collection .
i enjoyed this book . it 's historical setting is interesting and helps the plot along . the characters are well developed , and the end was surprising .
this story was too long , too detailed and sometimes confusing . if you like end of the world stories , this is a good one .
this book is so helpful on just being the best you you can be . i loved it . it helps you live a more full and rewarding life .
the item arrived in a timely fashion and was in perfect condition . i will certainly not hesitate to order again . thank you for providing such wonderful customer service !
this is okay , the writing style is easy to read and flows well . it was delightful to see how she developed her characters . may chose to read more of her work later .
this whole series has been great . i have not read one yet i did not fall in love with . i would highly recommend this series .
i just started my 4th collection of the 50 state quarter collection and this one is just like the others . it 's perfect
great book , great characters , great plot . this is a great series i 'm thoroughly enjoying . there 's humor and warmth and some heartache , but it 's real . i recommend this book .
this book is designed for people who really have never used a weight loss book before . it has good points to follow .
i enjoyed the book and i am looking forward to the sequel . at least i hope there is a sequel .
good detective story . the plot was good . i love how it keep me guessing . i wish it was a little series . i would love to read another book with this detective .
love romance books by j. s. scott , would let everyone know about these books ca n't wait to see her new books
that was an amazing stories to read love them all you just feel like you need to be in a different zone to read this amazing must read
i loved it .. i 'm praying there is a part 3 for some of the unanswered questions . i recommend that people buy this book . i loved it ..
could n't wait to start the series and it was everything i was looking forward to . more on the way , i hope .
very good book a lot of twist and turns some things were predictable but all in all a great read
i ended up staying up very late to finish because this book was that good . i will be reading this one again .
after reading the first book , i went ahead and got all the books in the series . i like these books .
i have read most of the plum series and they are great . the in between series are just as good . i wish there were more of them
this trilogy is fantastic . gripping , happy , sad , angry . i think i went through every emotion . a great read ! i will read again and again !
was a great read and by the end i wanted to and did purchase the next book ! will read the whole series
bought this to go with a father 's day lesson for children 's church . very cute book , but story was a little confusing for the younger ones . the illustrations are great though !
terrible author . needs to do some background research on substance abuse . needs to dig in and make her characters actually believable . not worth the paper it is written on .
beautifully written and thought provoking ! i will be buying her other books as well . she is a modern american master !
i liked the characters and the story line of this book . i could not wait to read the next book to continue to see what happens in the story line .
i loved this book ! ! great addition to the series ! ! so much emotion ! i fell in love with the characters all over again ! !
its not your typical sexy alpha and female alpha book . i highly recommend this book to everyone who has an interest in werewolf paranormal romances .
i will continue to the read the other books on the series as i would like to see where the writer goes with the story but it was bit boring and dragged a bit too long ...
childhood is hard . sometimes it is harder than it needs to be but children are survivors . they find a way to keep on loving their parents whether they deserve to be loved or not .
did not meet my expectations , and not even sure what they were anymore . by the time i got it and got into it , i was bored . sorry ... ... ... ... ... ..
this is an interesting book and worth the time but is n't a must read . good character development and interesting plot angle .
although longer than an average short story , this one could have had a little more substance to it . it 's still a good story and worth the read .
every morning , it 's delightful to read one of her miracles . she is awesome and her book too ! i start my day ready for miracles !
finally someone that tells the truth about women and work , instead of the liberal lies about women in the work force .
for a mystery , you would expect to find out the answer to the mystery and this one just left you hanging . we read this with our book club and were all disappointed with the ending .
a well written and enjoyable read . i hope to read more from this author . i definitely recommend this book for those who enjoy romance .
the story series keeps getting more twisted and appealing the more i read it . you cant put it down because you have to know whats on the next page .
i absolutely loved this book ... .. down to the wicked mother in law . great characters and enjoyable story . i will certainly buy more books by this author .
have really enjoyed previous books by sandra dallas , but this was truly a disappointment . it was so lacking that i did n't even want to pass it along to the free library !
this is the first book i have read by this author . was pleasantly surprised to find it was more mystery than romance . it kept my interest and moved along to a good ending .
an excellent novel by a master . not quite as strong as the original set but still far better than the usual fare .
awesome he 's done it again the man is a genius and funny at that . thank you carl for making big sexy
good phrases when you get stuck and do not know what to say or how to say it nicely done .
this book is fantastic ! i 've tried several projects and will try many more . i am making a project for an art show and this book is a terrific inspiration .
this book appears to be written by a very young girl . set in times gone by it is a very weak story
nice character development of the heroine -- not your usual choice for the lead character but well done and a good read .
i enjoyed the book so much that i read the sequel . nicely written . with this style of writing so almost felt as if you were there .
purchased this book earlier today . started reading it and could not put it down . told from a child 's view , this story is amazing . this book is a must read for everyone .
if you want a good book get this one ! i wo n't leave a spoiler review . i like different types of storylines but i really am looking forward to the 2nd book .
this book held my interest from beginning to the end . it kept you guessing throughout the book . it was very well written and very enjoyable .
loved this series of books . if you like paranormal and romance , these books are good . i look forward to a continuing story . have to find out about the continuing characters .
it was a very good book from the beginning to the end i would recommend it to everyone to read.i
it is a great book but we have n't finished it yet . unfortunately the book is falling apart . maybe we left it in the sun too long .
this book was very exciting ! i could n't put it down . i will definitely recommend this book to others ! great read .
i appreciated the fact that it is n't a book in a series . it tells about living in a small town , which was a big change for the main character of this book .
the story got off to a slow beginning but made up for it fast ! i wo n't go in to details but if you enjoyed the first book you will be impressed with the second ! enjoy !
hard to get my kids to read and this one they got right through it and loved it . keeping a kids attention is hard and this one managed to do it .
this was a good read . great character development throughout . believable story line with interesting twists . i definitely could have gone without all of the foul language .
it was pretty dull really . i expected more from her after such an interesting first installment . oh well , at least i wasted money on it .
i like the idea behind this book but the instruction you must read before starting is very thick and hard to read through .
great love story ! ! i love the way she tries to hide the way she feels really feels about her husband .
i chose this book for my granddaughter who is going on 13 years of age . girls her age should know how to take care of themselves .
it was a decent read and it kept my interest . can beat the price = free so i thought , why not ?
crazy how much information can be in such a compact book . very interesting and informative , not just for combat , but for anyone wishing to learn first aid on their own time .
it is difficult to believe this book is this author 's first novel . the characters are rich , the book flows from page to page . you 'll be hooked from the first page ! !
i like the book , just wish it had colored pics ! but overall , it is great to read about and find recipes .
i enjoyed this book very much . it was fun to read the interactions between the characters . the only part i found disappointing was the end because it was so abrupt .
i liked the book . like in the past i got upset with rush because he is a little bit of a push over with his sister bit all is well that ends well .
since i read the first one and i thought it was okay , i thought i should read the second for closure . well i like the first one better . i guess i thought they were okay .
a page turner . stick with it even if you are n't sure you should turn the page . it as an unexpected ending .
i only read the first novella , and that was enough time wasted . no plot , no story , and no character development . a very boring short story .
very good read . just wish it had have been longer . so many great characters and a surprise ending makes it an interesting page turner .
what a great series . ca n't get enough of wool ! ! ! anxiously waiting for wool 6 release ! thank you for such good writing .
was not your normal zombie novel but surprisingly it was a good read . the main character was interesting and always has helpful tips .
wow this book was absolutely wonderful ! ! ! kind of makes you think that it could be very real . scary however intriguing .
this book has a little of everything . there is murder and sadness but there is also hope and laughter . it 's quick and lite read .
what a great read . i really would like to know more about sir . jennifer is open and adventurous and sir is just the right dom to help her let go ! ! !
wonderful story and writing . i enjoyed very much . i will read more by this author soon . recommend this book highly .
i am a grandma and would recommend this to my teen grandchildren . the story was great . the characters great . good life lessons . good ending .
i loved it ! ! the story was interesting and the characters were hilarious . hard to put the book down . i can definitely read this book again
really good read . nice way of ending it funny at times but still remains serious . just a good book over all .
this book is such a great read ! i enjoy the plain language and it was n't as deep as other books . i recommend this book
amazing book . different but truely a good book . finished it in one setting .
i do n't know what i was expecting but certainly not a detailed list of his trials and tribulations , none of which was his fault according to the book .
great book and very easy to read on my kindle . exciting book and now i want to view the movie . books like this will encourage children to read and hopefully improve their reading skills .
it was hard to put this book down ! ! one of the best books i have read in awhile . there are so many different feelings and thoughts in this book . i highly recommend ! !
but not great either . good storyline , but characters were n't very deep , seemed like a rush ending ... . i wo n't be reading anymore from this author .
thought i was ordering the book and it was just the workbook . i 'll need to order the book to go with the work manual .
i expected a little more out of this book . i did n't think it got into the emotions of a teen pregnancy like it should have .
i think these books just keep getting better and better . i honestly ca n't wait to see what happens next . must read ! !
i expected more from this series . the men were supposed to be strong and they are not coming across in the pages that they are . i find the heroines to be lacking some as well .
too much dirty language , almost stopped reading this book . good mystery . had to see how they finally caught the killer .
burke is one of the best ! he puts the reader right in the story . as with his previous stories , the end leaves me anxiously wanting the next ,
these two books are both fun to read and very engaging . i enjoyed them thoroughly and am looking forward to reading the 3rd in the series .
this author really surprised me . so glad i got to read the entire bundle without having to wait for each one of the series . i look forward to more of his books .
i have just finished the fourth book . i can wait to by the and read the rest of the series
these books are always full of compassion and love . the storyline for this book was interesting and kept me reading til late .
this was the first book in the series and with each one of the books i read i became more involved in the characters lives .
a very inspirational and enjoyable book . i thought the whole series was worth reading very happy with purchase , highly recommended .
while it was a good book , it was very predictable and i knew what was gon na happen from the first chapter .
i did not see this book as it was ordered for a friend in texas . it appears to be o.k . with him .
i enjoyed her book very much . i have read several of her books and will continue to do so . a very good read .
i really liked this book . it was my favorite out of all three of the books . not my favorite and still find the female character annoying and that is why i only gave 4 stars .
this book continues to bring the type of story telling that will keep you spellbound to the end wanting more !
good read . love the lady killer . kinda short but solid . good read for a lazy week end . defiantly worth a second read through .
it seems like he keeps the book well updated and organized . i do like the it is written . it is not only good for school but it is great for work as well . buy it .
this book is exotic from beginning to end . it reminds me of fifty shades of gray . finish reading it in two days and this was because of work
loved this book ! it had everything i like ... romance , humor , and a happy ending ! i look forward to reading more of katie 's books !
i really enjoy jennifer ashley 's writing . i am a huge fan of hers . i enjoy the shifters series immensely . this book was sort of predictable . but , still really enjoyable .
sisters that are important to each other - to the point of all others - i read all 4 books in this series - by the time i finished book 2 - i knew i would read all four .
i have read more than 100 e books in the last 9 months , this has been the best one so far . i will be purchasing the rest of the series .
loved this book in the series . wish there were more days in the week . good mystery with the romance . looking forward to the next book .
i enjoyed this novel , it was an easy and entertaining read . it makes you stop and think about wasting time !
we need the third one ! this is a great sequel to a great book . i think it is a must read .
this was a very interesting book . i read it in 2 nights . i could n't put it down ! ! i loved it and have passed it on to a friend .
this should not be on kindle . it is a short article , not a book . at best it should be free . my advice - do n't buy
another great from cathy glass . i did n't want it to end and could n't put it down , lucy found a wonderful forever family .
this book is so good . i love biographies and historical accounts , and especially as someone currently living in virginia near some of the locations in the book , it did not disappoint .
this was a pleasant book for a cold night , before the fire as the cold wind blew outside . max has a way with words that paint a nice picture .
nice read , engaging & a definite page turner ! keeps you on edge wanting to read the fate of these characters ! onto part 2 ...
ca n't wait to read book two to see what happens next . really is got me thinking of maybe writing a list of my own .
i enjoyed the book . i 've already read the bridge and really enjoyed reading what went before . i think anyone would like the book , but a must for those who have already read the bridge .
the book was ok. not as good as others , but not too horrible . plot was a bit predictable and the characters were pretty one dimensional .
i love to laugh when im reading it make my husband wonder what 's up in the book im reading this has it all and heat heat heat .
what a good christmas book has very sad moment but it also about finding yourself about being able to move on
i enjoyed the character development and how the plot unfolded in this story . this is my second or third time with this author and i was not disappointed !
this is awesome . i love the story line in this set . can not wait to see what happens in parts 5 & 6 ! ! ! !
i think the story line and the writing is excellent . my only criticism is that the books are extremely short and the series is not complete . otherwise this is a really good read .
have n't read it as of yet . reading hunger games at this time but it sounds good . i like suspenseful stories
very good book ! ! thought we had heard everything about world war ii , but never heard of the forgiveness side before . highly recommend
love it ! this book is hot and steamy and very well written . characters are great , and the story line is very interesting .
this was one of my first books i purchased for my ebook reader . it was tender and sweet . a good way to start reading historical romance .
i so do not want a new book like this one ever again ! it is very uninteresting and plain dumb . i will never read this book ever again in this entire world and universe .
this book is a great book for children . my nine year old love these book series . this is his 3rd series book he is reading .
i read a lot of adult science fiction and fantasy . it was refreshing to read a young adult oriented story that was as detailed and riveting as this . my hat 's off to suzanne collins .
if you already love fool 's gold series wo n't be dissapointed in this story , has a hot love story and great characters
sex , danger , sex , mystery , sex , drama . pretty much the way books should be . story is good , would 've been great but for small gaps in story .
this mystery series really hold your interest the whole way through . you really think you know who did it and find out you do n't .
the jamie bond series is one part stephanie plum , two parts charlie 's angels . fun , easy reads with characters worth rooting for .
honest and informative . if it is provocative it is through the eyes of experience searching for truth . a good read .
it was simply ok for me not the worst but not best read for me . not to memorable . i did n't read the book before this one and do n't have desire too .
great character development that keeps you flowing with them . even thought it does n't really need it i wish there was a sequel . i guess i do n't want to let the characters go .
nice easy read . i could not put it down . read it in one sitting . strong , believable heroine gets her man and the dog , too .
it is very very short and very very easy and lot of rhymes in fact the whole book is rhymes and it 's stupid .
purchased for my husband . he loved it and gave it to me to read . i very much enjoyed this and gave it to a friend to read .
this book has been invaluable to me as a teacher . it has great ideas and is well-written . it is easy to understand and to follow .
this book was over before i knew it ! i enjoyed it and knowing the location a bit was fun . the story grabbed your attention from the start . cant wait to start the next one .
this book was well written and illustrated with interesting subject matter . it arrived quickly and was well priced . any young reader who likes star wars would like this book .
quick moving but too predictable . too many pages of words for too little action . i would have preferred something a little more plausible .
enjoyed this read , will look for other books in this series , looks like there are a few more books to read .
good story line . but would have liked it to have more substance . but i may read lucy 's story . oh well ... ...
interesting subject and parts of the book were well written . the book needs more material to make the effort worthwhile .
it was n't predictable , i 'll tell you that . it left me in suspense . i liked the ending and part 2. keep up the good work .
i could n't put this book down ! ! ! i thought the first one was awesome but this book was even better ! ! ! hurry up with the next one please
not one of your better books ms. jance . perhaps you should spend more time developing your plot . i have read many other books written by this author that were much better written .
this was a great book , i loved the characters , how the story played out , i would recommend this book it was a joy to read .
i thought that this book will give more information but it did n't . i wanted some blending tips but there were none
absolutely amazing read , must read all the books in this family line start at the beginning to much to miss if you do n't
great book , looking forward to reading the next book . things got interesting at the end , but leaves you wanting more .
enjoyed reading this book . the story was interesting and kept my attention . interested in reading other books by this author .
i was pleasantly surprised to read her book and how talented she is as a writer ! ! i could n't put that the book and was shocked by the ending ! a must read ! ! ! !
i am not sure what i expected , but this is some really cheap raunchy stuff . and very poorly written as well .
very good book , a little confusing at times with the names . an excellent mystery with lots of twists and turns . this one will keep you guessing until the end . i recommend it '
very believable story about time travel . this will make you think twice about your life and what it would be if you changed just a minor thing . fast read .
the hunger games ! i highly recommend it ! suspenseful , loving , running , fighting , it 's everything wrapped up into one book ! love it !
the book was a great read . i truly enjoyed the book . the only thing that i did n't like was the way the book ended . unless there is a part 2 to the story .
i purchased this book along with book one . both were good light reading . i usually go for books with more action , but this one was a good diversion .
it sounded like a formula with just the names changed . i guess i read too many of them and feehan could spend less time on explicit sex and more time on a story line .
pretty fun read -- not grisham at his best , but a page turner . his wit and background provide the basis for a good legal story.i remain his fan .
loved reading adam and abby 's story . looking forward to reading the next book in this series . marie is a wonderful author and i love reading her books .
it left me satisfied and wanting more . i was anxious for the 3rd installment in the series and it did not disappoint .
that 's all it was absolutely amazing i loved it perfect i am in love with the book awesome love story will make u cry
good idea to search with your detective for jack reacher . but did not believe her story . if your expecting a good jack reacher type book ? ? ? ? you will be disappointed .
this is a good book , very inspirational ! it is easy to read and understand . i would recommend it to anyone
this is n't to long , and he hits some amazing points . i really suggest this for anyone . you might find something in it that helps you live life a little more fully
fast moving story with plenty of action to keep you riveted . great characters and story line . it always seems to end just as it really starts getting really good . ca n't wait for the next book .
i loved the characters and the story . i would highly recommend . i could n't put it down until i finished it .
the more i read this series the more involved i became . i will be buying the next book hoping that they continue to grow
it is a good compilation of old recipes . it has a rather long forward and can be hard to read
i am a romantic reader who looks for some sexy reading , but also wants a good plot . this definitely delivers on that . love this writer .
i liked story line very much ! ca n't wait to find out what happens next ! super paranormal heroes to the rescue !
a good read . plenty of descriptive detail . liked the historical information at the end of the book.. would be interested in reading more from the author .
this book was a awesome read and i could n't put it down . i ca n't wait for part 2 to come out .
another great book from colleen hoover . i was sucked into the story line immediately . very unique storyline that just blew me away . i highly recommend this book .
so many great ideas and so little time to cook , but i can not wait to try these and save money too !
at first i was n't sure , but now i highly recommend this book . it is a great story and great message . definitely worth reading !
good info . but for some reason it got boring for me . just did not hold my interest . the cost was great , and it is n't bad , just not one of my favorites .
what a great story ! love has no respect of time or place . from the 1800 's to the present this is a timeless story of a love , trust , and following your heart .

dan brown does it again with another wonderful book . detailed and action pack suspense , it makes you think what tomorrow holds for us .
i really enjoyed reading this book . great story line , i could n't put the book down once i had started reading it . thanks for the happy ending .
an implausible plot . a political dialogue from the far right point of view . the end could not have happened early enough .
it was not that exciting . very repetitive , you could see the ending well before the end . character ok but it really needed better editing .
i really enjoyed this quick read . it was fun , and entertaining . i ca n't wait to see the next cast of characters who get their own books !

it was not the best story but it definitely kept me reading . the end was not what i expected but all in all , it was okay .
only an introduction to the next story . do n't bother unless you want to spend money for each part in the series
i liked the story and the characters but i am not as tied into the series . i am going to read book 2 and see how i feel .
it was a very entertaining story . i like history about ww2 , and it gave me another perspective on what life was like for a foot soldier during that experience .

i did indeed like this novel . the characters were convincing . i always like an unexpected pleasant ending . i like it a lot .
i love the amish and their strong family values . the rest of our current culture could learn how to enjoy life .
i could not give a review of this book because the story was so ridiculous , i dont know why i stuck with it , i could do a better job myself .

a good book . the first one by this author that i have read , started a little slow but after getting into it i found it interesting . i will read another of his books .
these beautiful men only exist in our dreams well maybe not entirely but for the most part yes these sexy men make vampires almost real

i never knew what would happen next . did n't know how it would end . kept coming back to find out more .
i have referred to this book many times . the author puts everything in an easy step format . user friendly . it is a great reference tool for the kindle fire hd .
the idea of this book is a good one but if bought on a kindle it is very hard to navigate and i found the recipes were not very good .
liked it much better in the beginning chapters , then seemed ( to me ) to peter out . maybe a more avid dog lover would enjoy it to the end .
when purchasing this book on my kindle , i was afraid that it would n't include the maps , but it does ! so glad !
did n't know how to rate this book . if you like porn it 's a 5 , if you like action it 's a 1 .
i am liking the story line although i was a bit let down by how predictable it became . nonetheless i enjoyed the read .
i really liked this book , it has a storyline , reasonable characters , and a plot . i do think that it 's more to this story though .
i enjoyed this book as the author keeps you guessing about the outcome . plus writing in the past and the present .
this book is so interesting to me . i really enjoy reading and watching true stories . very catching , hard to put down .
it is like other grisham books , it got my attention at the beginning and held it . i would definitely recommend it to anyone .
this was a very action packed story with a slight dark side . completely enjoyed the twists and turns . riveting tale but a sad ending .
this is a great light hearted series that was super enjoyable . the characters are likeable and you want them to work things out .
i enjoyed this book but it was very easy to see that it was written some time ago . i was worth reading for the history that was revealed .
i had read the first three books more than 20 years ago and always thought i to read them again ... . the author repeats herself a lot in the later books .
i was thoroughly captivated by the story . the characters were portrayed so vividly . i could see their faces in my mind . ca n't wait to read book # 2 .
a really short read , but good . not all books have to be long to be a good one . this is definitely one of those books .
i loved this book it was the best of the series , it had a great mix of suspense and romance . this book is so totally engrossing i sat and read the whole thing in one day .
first time reading this author , however , the story line was exciting . good job . would recommend to my friends to read .
very cute book and well written ! i enjoyed reading this book . cant wait to read the others in the series !
talk about cliff hanger , there has to be another book . there is no way the story can end here . i only hope it comes out soon .

loved it did not want to put in down . i had read book 3 and have now gone to book 1 to get the whole story
just when i thought it was ending , something dramatic happens and a new storyline starts up and makes it more exciting . and of course the story ends with a cliffhanger .
loved this novel ! ! thought it was going to be like the first series i read trashy and no point , but it had a great story line ! ! ! loved this !

gave this as a gift to a friend of mine . he is a big hunter and enjoys watching a lot of hunting shows . he and his wife said the book was very enjoyable .

fast paced easy reading . i did n't , want the story to end . intense feelings by all the characters . truly believable . i felt the love as well as the conflicts . a real treat .
as in the first book , the events leading from it keep a smooth flow that keeps the pages turning . would recommend to friends .

it was engaging and exciting ... hard to put down . would read more by this author as she does keep the audience in suspense .
a very different take on th paranormal . a detailed plot keeps you on the edge of your seat and the end i g keeps you wanting more .
i always try to figure the plot and the people out before the story ends . sometimes i & # 34 ; m right . this kept me reading and wondering what the outcome of the characters were

you never knew what to expect from one page to the next . i thoroughly enjoyed this book and did n't want it to end !
i love this one . great characters and story line . a real pleasure . i am sure i will read this one again in the future .
this was a good book . a few typos , names ... etc . but overall , a well paced book . finished it in a day .
so sad about what happens out there . things we probably take for granted , spoil out kids with material stuff when all the really need is your love and support . will remember this one always .
should be a good read . have n't read the author before , kindle gives me so many choices , looking forward to this read .
i did n't find this to be interesting or helpful . of all the great relationship books out there , this one gets a & # 34 ; pass & # 34 ; .

well thought out , nicely organized and very easy to follow . i do believe that i will love most of the dishes in this book .
the book as a whole is a bit boring . there were about two pages before the last chapters that i enjoyed . but the last chapters were worth reading through it to get to .
storyline in this series is good , starting to get bogged down with too much sex and losing my interest fast
this book was not easy to read at all . i just held out to see how it would end . i ca n't say i am happy at all .
i have n't finished yet but so far i am impressed . it 's well written and intriguing . i ca n't wait to see what happens !
the beginning is all over the place and the characters annoying , more time should have been put in developing the beginning . overall ok but very predictable
a good new book of jo nesbo . like his others a read in one time one . good and thrilling story
a good novel about an interesting place and interesting characters . not high art but enjoyable and well written . way better than watching tv .
it 's ok. more like therapy for the author . which is cool of course it has it 's moments but overall the book is boring . i forced myself to finish it . sorry
an ok , quick read . no where close to the next `` gone girl '' , as i have heard it described by others .
this series just keeps getting better and better . i ca n't wait for the next one !
the only reason i finished the book is because it was the only one available , and there was nothing else to do .
loved , loved this book , so much suspense . this is a must read book . i will read anything that ruth has written .
children enjoy listening to this story over and over . they find something different in the pictures every time . good for small groups .
okay as short stories go but stories ended without a finish to the story .
i really enjoyed this series . i got the first book free and read the next two within the week . just give them a try . i definitely was n't disappointed . i had fun reading these books !
all read these books for a reason but i do like a good story line with characters you can & # 34 ; feel & # 34 ; . good piece of literature besides a passionate read .

i enjoyed these books so much . i always feel sad when i finish one . give them a try . you wo n't be disappointed .

excellent story with many , many twists and turns leaving you wondering who is up to what . not a put down book because the story keeps you driven to reach the end .

sometimes when you hear a lot of hype about a book , your expectations are very high . i enjoyed reading this book , but it did n't blow me away in the least .
rambling at times but otherwise the right amount of humor to keep it interesting . scenery descriptions were very good . i have been to alaska and know that it is beyond description at times .

although the subject is interesting , and something i knew nothing about , i thought the story was predictable . i certainly respect the research and the effort that went into bringing this story to us , however .

every once in a while i read one of his novels that i really would hate to have missed . i 've liked all that i 've read and this one is one of the best .

this was certainly not the bread machine book that i wanted , so , my error , i made the wrong selection . i do n't see anything in it that is helpful to me .
this follows the first i read , of miss julia . the author keeps things at a fast pace and despite lots of characters , easy to follow . she paints an excellent picture of each character
some will love this book , but it was so repetitive that i did n't see a use for a whole & # 34 ; book & # 34 ;
much better than ghost story , but still not to the level of the earlier work . look forward to the continuing work .

this was my first book by linda ford . it is a fun story and i really enjoyed it . now , i need to read some more of her books !
ken follett continues to create amazing characters . the further i read into the story , the more difficult it was to put the book down .
a light fun read . not as interesting or involved as i 'd thought it would be & the main character was n't all that believable .
nothing less than what you 'd from riordan and percy jackson . twists and turns everywhere . i ca n't wait for what 's to come .
i really love to read christian love stories , and these three stories were great . a good book to relax and read on a rainy day .
i gave this to a & # 34 ; days & # 34 ; fan . lots of fun pictures from about 5 years ago . too bad they did n't have a current issue .
i loved this sci-fi book and looking forward to read the whole collection ! it would be amazing to discover where this leads me !
not your usual washington post writing . you can tell that the writers know and love this subject . it covers many aspects of the war , some that people may not know already .
a lot of interesting ideas on how to train a horse to do tricks and how to relate to your horse on a higher level .

an unusual book . i enjoyed reading it . i would like to read more of this author . he had a good story line .
for the price , it 's ok , but now much in the book to hold a child 's interest for any length of time .
story is ok. writing style very simplistic . as if writen for the very young . maybe it was ? struggled through it .
i 'm a slow reader unless it keeps me in suspense . this book was ok took me 5 months to read . some parts were good some boring . but like i said i 'm not a reader .
very interesting concept and the story develops nicely . nicely written . appropriate amount of & # 34 ; steam & # 34 ; as the relationship develops . story ending is predictable .
starts off with a bang and continues with a fast pace . i found it tough to put this book down . definitely worth buying and reading .

i just loved all the j d robb books and cant wait for the next one to come out -- love the story and the people follow up in the books -- makes everything so enjoyable
i received the book in record time and it was a beautiful book . it should serve a family of two girls quite nicely for a long time . thank you
i liked the story line , but it had a lot of swear words and at least one really graphic sex scene . i was n't comfortable reading it , and ended up skimming through parts and skipping pages .
this was a well written novel filled with adventure until the very end . i simply ca n't wait until part 2 ... ...
really good book . i liked the story line , but a bit predictable . i would read more from this author . good character development
i only read this book because it was free . believe me i should have gone with my gut and left it alone .
it may be old but to me the old sf is the best yet . these old writer 's work continues to entertain .
this was a great read . i wish there were more books in this series . the author did a great job developing these characters and i want more .
this would be a great story line for a novel , otherwise its ok for a short story ; glad it was free .
the first 2 books in this trilogy were amazing . i could n't put them down , read them back to back . ca n't wait for book 3 !
just not what you think it would be , even looking inside was misleading to me , save your money unless you really no nothing about nutrition .
loved the series but this prequel did not fit . it introduced too many new characters that were unnecessary to the story line . i was disappointed .
loved the book . written in typical stephen king fashion , i was not disappointed . story was great , characters interesting and it 's a fast and exciting read .
i love this novel and recommend it to anyone who wishes to learn more about the middle ages hopefully , you will read .
really enjoyed this book . never quite know what you might get when you try a different author . very good job .
i could not put this down . i love the premise and the characters . i ca n't wait for the next book in the series .
not what i expected , wanted or liked . story is just bad . it could be good , but the author did n't ... try or finish ?
i love the books from this author . she is a great writer . you will not have a dull moment when you read this book . k
i actually read this without stopping or getting any sleep . i could n't help it , the writing is very good . this writer makes a story come together so well .
it was a good story , but somewhat unbelievable . and there was at least one question that was not answered . worthwhile reading .
i enjoy a good thriller and this did not let me down . i am looking forward to reading other noble adventures . ed
the book arrived earlier than promised , was packaged well , priced reasonably and is of good quality . i am a happy customer .
very good book , i enjoyed reading this book , finished reading in 2 days . look forward to reading another book by this author .
great read . page turner ! could not put it down ! not only a quick read , but a good read ! enjoyed facts woven in with fiction !
this book was good as far as keeping me interested . however , there was too much blood , guts and bone description for my taste . probably wo n't read the other books because of that .
but this book did not flow for me like her others . sorry i was disappointed . maybe following two different love interest ?
she loves this book and has already make one quilt from it ! she 's made two quilts from the second book .

i now know much more about the beginning of our government and was surprised that the differences between political parties then are much like today .
i love james patterson and , once again , he captivated me right from the beginning . many twists and turns and i could n't put the book down . very good !
great book keeps you wanting to read more so you can find out how it ends . each character fits their role perfectly . i highly recommend it .
this book began slow and i was wondering what all of the fluff was about . then , suddenly , i could n't put it down . good book !
this is a dark trilogy , but very good , not sure if the third book was needed since it is not her who is writing but him . but it was ok , a love story .
the characters and the town are described in such a vibrant manner it was easy to get lost in this story . all in all a book well worth reading .
i did n't really expect to enjoy this book as much as i did . ms. brown exceeded all expectations . i bought the whole series and am waiting for the next sequel . escapism at its best !
love it . love the series , love where it is going . you can lose your self in the story and just enjoy .
cathy write yet another inspiring book . i ca n't wait till her next book comes out and hope she continues writing more , she is an incredible woman , true inspiration !
love this book ! ! ! i could n't put it down . i think i read the book in 2 days ! ! i would defiantly recommend this book to anyone ! !
great content , plot , appropriate dialogue . however , i found the male character to be immature . it takes away from the book .
i read this in one night and will look for more of this author 's books . great mystery , some romance , good intrigue . great story that is very fast paced .
the book was well written and kept my attention ; although it was very sad , it was great to see that the author found an angel to help her get her life back on track .

i have to say you will not be disappointed by buying and reading this book . i loved every page . loved ! ! ! ! ! ! !
great book- i read it awhile back and should probably reread it . its short and easy to read with a clear message .
a wonderfully crafted tale blending science , humans , and the price other species pay for the greed of man . a must read ... it left me wanting more !
a book i did n't want to put down . lots of mystery about who the characters were - vocabulary i did not know but could read and enjoy anyway
too much of the story was on one woman , who was as annoying as hell ! . too , too , much of that woman .

one of my favorite books on mary todd lincoln . it gave some new information and some great insight to what her life might have been like .

this is an easy read . the characters are believable and engaging . ca n't wait to read the next book in this series . great job .
i love these kind of books , uplifting - even if you kind of know how the end will be , it 's the journey that gets there . makes you appreciate life sometimes .
very fine print , so very hard for me to read . bought this to enjoy with my great grand daughter , but now i guess i 'll have to wait until she can read it to me .
i usually stick to free books but this series just hooked me and i had to buy them all and read them . loved the ending and wish there were more

i was very impressed ! i have just ordered two more of her books . the end was a complete surprise for me !
an easy read , full of facts seen before but put together in a logical sequence . answers why we know so little about our current president .
this is a story about the parents of adult children wanting to get married and the kids do n't want it .
a great story with a lot of intrigue . with a surprise ending . the characters were interesting and the story flowed well .
i am only giving this book four stars because of how long it took to get me hooked . if not for that i would give it 5 stars . great story once it hooked me ,

i enjoyed reading this book and would recommend it . the final outcome was a little bit predictable , but the story was different .
this is one of the best mc books i 've read in a long time . i will be counting the days until the next installment .

this is a great book for sisters . many twist and turns occur throughout the life of these two women . the ending is not what i expected . good read

beautifully written with fantastic characters . i just wish that the installments were longer than they are . definitely one to read .
i love this series . strong female character with great action . the plots are crazy but i am not looking for realism , i am looking for fun . what 's not to love !
well the story is interesting but now the twists are getting predictable enough but let 's see where it leads to
this series is great , each book builds on the story and the universe . i can not wait for the next book .
this guide is for beginners only . information provided in this can be found on and good investing website . but still its good book to start with for anybody those who dose not know anything about stock market .
the story did n't seem believable . i think it is more someone 's wan na be thoughts than anything that might really happen . simple story line . not imaginative at all .
i loved the art in this book . a great story told through pictures .
i thought it was more of an autobiography of the writer . not very exciting to hold my interest . the end
i completely enjoyed this book - had me surprised a few times ! well written - liked the characters , great plot !
reading all of these reviews its obvious this book is amazing . take the time . spend the money . you wo n't regret it . time spent reading reviews could be time spent loving making faces .

if you look past the whole slave aspect i think you 'll like the story . i do like the following books much better than the first few .
i really enjoyed this boxed set - vampires , werewolves , dragons even zombies - this set has everything i love in a romance : humor , adventure and intrigue

a quick read which is good because it 's just a so so book . i 've read better books by debbie macomber .

i thought this was a book , not a sample of children 's writing . shame on amazon ! if there were a rating lower than 1 star i would give it !
not a page turner . could be if it had more action . kind of left me hanging . maybe author setting up a series .
i loved this book ! the characters are believable , poignant , and i found myself rooting for them from beginning to end . this novel is so well written , i could n't put it down .
this is a cute book . probably more suited for a boy then a girl . it has a simple story and cute pictures . it 's not her favorite but a nice one to have .

initial offering in this series . good story . very good author writes a couple of other series , all good .
these are two very erotic short books . i ca n't call them stories because they do n't have a story . they are mainly one sexual encounter after another .
this book is better than the song and i really like the song ! the artwork is terrific and gives new meaning to dylan 's words .
this book was an incredibly fast read and has a plot that takes you exactly where you anticipate it would go . not a page-turner but sometimes you just want something very light when you 're on a plane .

hot and sexy , short and not so sweet . wow ! this novella was amazingly sexy ! i loved it from start to finish .

this book i think was my favorite of the three this author has written ... some romance but not over done ... i will definitely give this book as a gift .

been looking for this book for awhile . good price , good description on the condition of book and timely shipping .
it was adorable and cute , heartfelt and interesting . though i still have a few questions , the book was interesting enough i would read another by the author . well written with humor and thought .
she is easy to understand and relate to . she makes studying and learning the bible very easy . the end . thanks

short and comical . easy read ! i wish i could become someone new everyday ! i recommend for a quick , silly read !

this is tolkien ! everyone should read this book ! or listen to this book being read ... but that would be a different review .
i gave this book to a friend for his birthday and he loved it . i have not read it , but plan to borrow it from him one of these days .
a cool story that will keep you interested . there 's just enough drama going on between all the characters . i was disappointed in the typos which kept me from giving it five stars .
it was a good mystery , but did n't hold my attention , like other books . it was easy to put down and pick up a few days later .
fast paced and good character development . i read this book in one day . ca n't wait for the sequel . keep up the good work . good military sci go is hard to find .
i was intrigued by the review , but i just could n't get into this . more of a kids book , i suppose .

very interesting story , different type of book would normally read but really enjoyed from beginning to end . i would recommend it to other readers . nancy
one by the content and how it effects the book but also myself reading it . if it can keep me wanting to get back to the book or enjoying reading and having it a page turner .
connelly does it again . super plot and solid characters in an engrossing story . another harry bosch triumph . a great read .
i purchased this for a friend . he said the book was very interesting and enjoyed it very much . so this review is based on a friend .
great book , great series ! ! ! perfection ! you wo n't be able to stop reading it . it 's that good . so exciting , so captivating !
a thriller that is hard to put down . i just had to keep reading . if a book does n't grab me by the first chapter , i move on . plenty of twists .
it starts off a little disjointed but come together after the first few chapters . after that it 's a thrill ride for your mind .
good fast read . not as much story depth as there could have been . great for a first novel though ! hope to see her progress her talents .
i just loves this series ! ! i ca n't wait for the next book in this series ! ! if you love vampire books then you will like this as well .

this book overall was a good read . kept my interest throughout the book . i enjoyed it . mallory is one of my favorite authors .
this book was just as good as the first one ! i loved the story line and i ca n't wait to read what will happen in the next book .
cute idea , but the overall writing was n't great . girl gets sucked back into the past , falls in love - which world will they end up in ? not bad , just not great .
i enjoyed the twist of this book immensely . it was hard to put down . want to read more by this author !
i love this series and this is a great addition . i would recomend this to anyone who likes murder mysteries .

again , i really enjoy this author , she holds your interest , makes you laugh and wonder what is going to happen next !
this book is very well written ... very enjoyable to read . only complaint i have is that it got a little slow in the middle . in the end , well worth the time though .
this book had an unusual story line . i enjoyed reading this book because the characters were enjoyable to read about . surprise s around every turn .
debbie macomber 's books are like a breath of fresh air and i always wish i lived in a little town like she uses in her stories . she is a christian writer and it comes through .
this book was a page turner from start to finish even the back of the book held genius . ai look forward to reading more from the brother
first one of these i 've read . i love things from this time period and some of the information was interesting . i will probably read another one .
enjoyable cozy . if you 've ever struggled with weight issues , you will get a chuckle out of it . i definately related !
wish it was longer . this is a really good series , but it takes so long for them to write them . they could make a long series out of this , i sure hope they do ! !
this story got better and better . i love how all the characters from the other stories made it into this book .
loved this second book of the forever love series . i was so afraid that lucky was going to loose her love to another woman . read this , it is a must .
did n't capture my interest even in the sample sent . in my opinion , the writer did n't move the story along quickly enough , nor was the writing much above a 5th grade level .
a story of never giving up on your true love and soul mate . twists and turns throughout life can change our direction but this story makes you want to never give up on what you know was real .
i read all six books and each one was wonderful . as i finished one i could n't wait to get the new one .
great rhyming story with fantastic characters . a special christmas treat . perfect for the holidays . children will love this fun story .
i loved this book . i will read again . i 'm going to buy the whole series on my kindle . i even laugh at parts of this book .
this was a wonderful , sexy , loving and entertaining series ! i loved them all and will surely read them again ! perfect !
not an area of my usual reading but worthy of further exploration - the characters , their names and stories were interesting .
great read , i just love her books . she 's at the top for great authors , please keep up the good work . i love your books .
a great story . it 's both scary and exciting . you ca n't stop turning the pages . i hope to read all other books this author writes .
hard to explain , but the characters were just too unbelievable . it might appeal so some , and i did finish the book , but it 's not something i would read again .
i quite enjoy this series as it is very easy reading and the story line is good . i think the the author is good
nice fast read with a twist . enjoyed the pace and interaction of characters . will probably read another in the series .
i liked this book because it was an interesting version of what i hope will never happen in this country . the characters were realistic .
the book is beautiful and one those who enjoy seeing historic houses will enjoy . there are great colorful pictures , too .
good book , lots of fun & exciting . drew me in first page kept me laughing and turning pages , good time !
this edition was a good read , but it seemed much shorter and less involved than the first 3. left me wanting more
i loved it it was the most awesome book of the stories in the whole world is the public and media group limited edition and the most awesome book
love taylor lee books . the characters are brought to life and you are drawn into the story . definitely can not wait fir the next book in the series .
once i discovered it was fiction i lost interest somewhat . turned into more of a book for teens rather than mystery .
down to earth and with ideas that make you think about things you do n't want to admit about yourself . insightful and inspiring .
loved it ! it has everything i wanted : supernatural , suspense , romance and good world building . i 'm definitely buying the next book in the series !
james patterson never fails to keep you on the edge , have not finished it yet but so far i like it .

an amazing addition to the outlander series . just love the way diana gabaldon makes you feel like you are right there with the characters .
any of parker 's books are excellent , i usually read then in less then 3 days . promised land is just another excellent read , you wo n't be disappointed .
such an inspirational love story , it grabs you and does not let go , a great series ! i can not say i love it enough ! for sure

this was such a heartwarming story . one that i will read again next christmas and the next and the next ... ...
for some reason , my expectations were n't that high . but what a wonderful , delightful , enchanting book ! i highly recommend it .
too short . novella is not for me . i get going , knowing the characters then it is done . just a way to charge money for nothing .
this was a fun little short story that takes place between the two novels . for the price , well worth it .
this is a really good series . i read all three in one day . i ca n't wait for number 4 to come out ! ! !

intriguing characters and a storyline that has a bit of a mystery to it . recommend to anyone who needs a quick read
this series keeps getting better and better ! i hope the next one comes sooner rather than later ! it did n't disappoint me in any way !
i was not able to get into this book at all . poorly written , bad plot , you name it . two words .
a very good book . i read it in a day and really enjoyed it . look forward to reading more by her !
this book is interesting , but starts pretty slow . just like in the first book , the most entertaining and hard to put down section is the last 100 pages .
could not put this book down till i was done i love jo 's determination oh and zero omg love him ca n't wait to read part two ... .
this is a great book for women in their 20 ` s . i could relate to the main character throughout the whole book .

this is a collection of a few of her shorter stories . i mainly bought it for the first piece , which i thoroughly enjoyed .

just could not get into this book . most books hold my attention - this one did not . i found myself skipping through sections on my kindle just to see if it would get any better .
the author did a fabulous job with this book . i loved it and could not put it down . anxiously awaiting the next one .
great ya read . interesting story line and characters and paced well . i would recommend this book to others . story was never boring and i cared about the characters and the outcome of the story .

i like all of these authors although i have my favorites . sarah m eden being my favorite . i love all of her stuff .
i truly enjoyed this book . it was very different from other cat stories . i kept guessing as to what was going to happen next . ''
i have read tara road before , but had to choose for our book club and because this was such a good book , i picked it so everyone else could enjoy it .
beverly is a good writer so she got me to read the whole book . the story was n't great and i was bored 1/2 way thru .
i really enjoyed the complex story . kept me guessing . this book really came together and i enjoyed the ending very much . i would recommend this book to lee and horror fans alike .
i absolutely loved this book - so poignant , well written , moving without being over dramatic - a wonderful story to tell , and really a page turner . so glad i read it .
liked this book a lot and wish he would write a sequel to it . it was sad , humorous , and a lot more wrapped up into a pretty fast read .
read this book ! could not put it down then had to read the rest of the series . i love when you find out its a series and does n't have to end .
loved the book ! ! ! i caught me from the first page and i did n't want to put it down . ca n't wait for the next one .
i stayed up way to late to finish what i started late one evening . i loved the characters the connection and the anticipation was built up perfect . do n't miss it !
this is a good book for those of us who want to know what may be going on in america in the future .
i loved the book , the detail , and how it all wrapped up so nicely in the end . ca n't believe i did n't figure it out !
i found this book hard to get into and stay focus . it took about halfway before it held my attention . fair .
this was an easy , fast read . seemed a little juvenile at times and the writing seemed to be more oriented for a teen reader .
good believable western , sometimes a bit predictable , but a good read that keeps you engaged until the end . if you like western romance this is the book for you .
talk about dysfunctional ! this mother was a mess and the poor daughter had no one to model herself after that results in many poor choices .
enjoyed this action packed story . i was an enjoyable read . enjoyed the different take it had on the paranormal world .
do n't get me wrong . i love the poem . but i had understood it is a collection of poem , not just the one single poem and some images .
this book started out to be a bit depressing , but the ending made up for it . i liked and enjoyed reading it .
ordered this book on my kindle . it is a great story for a young child . would definitely recommend it to anyone .
great book it is helping my husband to experience more freedom to walk in the love of christ . i 'm looking forward to reading the book myself .
this is a must read ! ! ! i love this book . only bad thing i can say about it is i ca n't put it down so the book does n't last long .
i enjoyed it and will read the next in the series to find out how this turns out . i have a idea , but will wait to see if i am right .
good and simple book to read . enjoyable to pass the time . fine way to spend an afternoon and not stress out .
i absolutely loved this book and ca n't wait to read number five in the series . you know it 's a good book when you hate for it to end and miss the characters .
kevin smith is just plain entertaining . his honesty does n't exactly make him seem like a normal person , but he seems like someone you would want to have as a friend .
a very difficult book to follow -- need notes , almost . but still very intriguing and you want to go on and see what happens next .
it was a longer book than most which i loved ! and it was never boring . great back stories and relationships .
the plot does not hold up well in some critical moments ( why does n't george question what happened to the body ) and the ending is somewhat bizarre , but overall i enjoyed the read .
i love how this book was written with so many different point of views ! ! i ca n't wait to read more from the walker brothers and to find out what happens with each brother ! (
it was just ok for me . their was too much info for me . would have liked more romance and love action .
this is going back to his roots . it is a lot better than i could have hoped for . worth the money .
this book is a good guide to follow when looking for a way to get what you want in your life .
i like how the girls stick together threw thick an thin they had each other back . it 's sad that lynn and tiny had to die but i like books with happy endings .
this series rocks . i loved it , i am sure you will too . this book has so many hot men and so many possibilities . i love these characters so much .
great book to read before the holidays . i love reading christmas stories and i am a romantic at heart . worth your time .
the book is inspirational but has a common storyline -- just that you need a storyline . it is fun and cute and has a light-hearted tone which makes it pleasant to read !
i do n't like the way it is written . would have preferred more personal interaction than just the letters , myself . maybe my book club will feel differently .
the ending was sad and depressing . it ruined the entire series in my opinion . why have our brave hero and heroine end up sad and dead . why could n't their love and bravery conquer all ?
i was very disappointed in this book . i tried several times to read this book , just could not finish it . it jumped around so much i could never get a read on it .
i would definitely recommend to friends and family for reading and because of the outcome between a family generation of family history and the story line with describing the attraction between the two loves .
very entertaining ! clues keep you going in many directions and guessing everyone is involved . enjoyed the story very much and the mystery .
i loved this book that much that as soon as i finished reading it i had to download the next book and start reading it immediately
i picked up this book and could not put it down . it makes so much sense in a practical no nonsense manner . i find myself going to it again and again ! simply powerful and practical .
this story is not as engaging as i 'm used to from the reacher series . it 's got its moments but does n't really surprise the readers much . a couple of good characters but generally disappointing .
i enjoyed this one as must as the other , it was to good to put down so finished it much to soon
this book was incredible . if i could give it more than 5 stars , i would ! i read this book in 2 days ! ! could n't put it down !
any book lisa gardner writes it worth reading ! this was not my favorite book but i still enjoyed it and found it worth reading . lisa ca n't write a bad book !
interesting characters , great plot and quirky ending . will definitely read more by the author . a crime novel with lots of twists .
i have read all three of these books , and , absolutely love them ! ! i want more ! ! i love lucy and hope someday to see her with a really nice man . highly recommended .
this book surprised me . it was very easy to read and to follow the characters . great entertainment . look forward to reading about the other brothers .
i gave this as a gift to my granddaughter and she loved it and is more convinced that she wants to be a vet .
if you like to read about the tales of ireland you will like these books . they are fun books to read .
this book was confusing to me , but i kept reading . not the best one i 've read for sure . it 's ok .
enjoyed this book very much . it was funny , refreshing and relatively believable . i do not look for facts and reality , but something believable is enjoyable .
it 's a little to young for adult readers . a good book to start kids on fantasy . not for adult readers .
cynthia eden does it again . another great story with expected twists that keep you reading . i highly recommend this book .
i finally gave up on this book as i could not get into it and found it boring and unbelievable .
this is a very great book , i am amazed by it , it is well organized and also at the same time so profound and easy to read i love it .
an awesome read , which touches on subjects close to my heart , and opened my eyes to things i had n't considered ! well worth a read or 2 !
i truly loved this book . only problem is it was short : ( i would have loved to keep reading about their lives .
this book was boring and ridiculous . i would n't bother reading anything by this author again . there was no research done other than previous watched episodes of & # 34 ; most haunted & # 34 ;
i was very disappointed , although it was a great book to put this reader to sleep at night .. and quickly .
i knew i would like this book because peterson is one of my favorite authors . i was n't expecting to be so moved by these poems .

not written well . very predictable . total waste of money . i do not recommend the purchase of this item to anyone .
enjoyed the subject matter as it was unique and educational . but the writing was not as exciting . could have used some creative nonfiction elements like dialogue ...

such a great romance novel . loved the characters , did n't want to put it down . would read this author again in a second !
this book contained some nail biting chapters , some sweet , tender , loving parts & throughout this book you could not wait to turn the page to see what else was coming . this was a terrific book .
horrible book . no story line , sex , sex , and more sex . the women are all too eager and there is no suspense at all .
heart warming ! once again , nicholas sparks wrote a book that i could n't put down . i laughed , almost cried and was even worried ! a definite must read .
to parents of a young child . it was very well received . the child loved it . they are happy , so i am happy , too .
what was included in the book was informative , it needs more info on his personal life . it seems to be just an overview of the times he lived in and was involved with .
i was not impressed . could have been better . very short not worth the money . would not buy again or recommend .
i loved this book it was really awesome ! great plot and storyline ! thanks sandra for another great work of art !

enjoyed the book . one of those you hate to put down . of as with most series left you with a cliff hanger , need to read the next book in the series .
written from an interesting perspective , i read this book in a day . the movie it got turned into was n't as good though
pretty much common sense stuff . the bonus natural cleaning recipes were nice but odd , rather like the author needed to add a few more pages .
loved this book . one of my favorites . wonderful main character and unusual setting . i think a teenage boy would like this as much as an adult .
i read all three books in three days . very , very good ! once i started i simply could n't stop and wished there was more .
great read so many twists and turns , i am back into sandra brown books again . years ago she was my favorite author .

i always like reading follett although this story dragged a little . what is lacking in the story is made up by great characters . have a good read .
i could not get enough of this book . i was like too hot to handle ! ! ! then it was over but let me tell you it is worth the read .
i 've read many books and this is one of the best ever . i love this book so much . it 's way better than twilight .
this novel had me laughing out loud . the characters names fit them . good story . will gladly read more novels by mr. robinson .
this book is very thorough and easy to understand . i have been using the principles and feel the difference ! i highly recommend it .
i started to read this book for the fun stories , but it grew to more than that . as she told her tales , i began to reflect on my life and god 's hand in it .
i loved this book , it made me laugh and cry . i ca n't wait to read the other 2 books in this series .
the author just keeps the same story going and does n't finish anything . to much description of clothes etc . getting tired of the same story being carried on with no end

somewhat tedious in keeping the characters straight . interesting in that the stories are all interwoven and from different points of view .
it is great to be able to read a well written book without having to put up with smut and sin .
this book kept the readers interest the whole time . it got to where i could n't put the book down . the book took some unexpected twists which kept you on the edge of your seat .
great boxed set for the price ! enjoyed reading each novel . recommend to others . this is a good collection of books . i like urban fiction and this is a good set ... ...
this books picks up where the first left off . it is a good story and i would suggest to read them all .
i read a lot and i was so frustrated after just a few chapters ( including skimming ) that i just could n't get through it .
jill has never missed the mark on her stories . this is another wonderful read . i love the lucky harbor series .
a very believable novel without a hollywood ending . a must read . the supposed protagonist is a girl you hope will see the light . you assume she will .
i liked most of it but found it rambling at times . the author apparently has other books that are much better .
i was not overly fond of this book . i found it dull , boring and really had difficulty finishing the book . was not interesting at all .
this story kept me interested until the last page . sad yes , but very very well written . the characters were true to life .
great lessons for kids can be learned from this book ! bought it for our two grandsons ages 7 and 3 .

true to the game 3 will not disappoint you . it 's what we 've all been waiting for . you laugh and cry with the characters . this was the perfect end to the saga .
i am hoping there is a book 2. wow that 's all i can say is wow . has action , suspense , drama you name it this book have it . definitely recommend .
a pretty interesting what if book , fairly enjoyable read . i would recommend for someone looking for an interesting book that did not take a lot of thought .
a nice beach read . not too deep . fun how the twists all came together in the end .
i love e books especially this book which give me so convenient to find the recipe and make delicious cookies .
not a good story . it was short ... did not develop . i wish it was a better storyline . i wish it was longer .
this series is so good . makes you laugh , make you sigh , makes you cry . so many emotions in them . love .
i bought this book for a student . i assume that he liked it because i never saw it again after i gave it to him .
i read this book twice i liked it so much . i would say it should be read , but only if you love a good thriller like i do : d
i just love reading debbie 's books . she has a way of making you fall in love with the characters and becoming engrossed in their lives .
i really enjoyed this book , the characters , the setting and the plot . it was an easy read and very interesting throughout . i definitely want to see what savannah does next !

good short stories by some of my favorite authors . not too intense just fun . a nice change from battles and gore .
as normal a great book . i liked it better than the last one . again i will be getting the next one .
this book is great and has the answers . it will keep me off the phone with amazon . the amazon answer team is just great but the book is a blessing . thanks

this story was well written & interesting to read . it is nice to read a novel in this genre instead of a short story or novella which seems more of the norm than not .

i like it because of the surprising in the story . i even liked the surprising to me the end very much .
the author brings us another excellent offering . i really like how each episode seems to focus a little on a different character .
wonderful story line , somewhat believe able . just goes to show not everyone has to be tiny . i really enjoyed it .
well written with a sense of humor about a very tragic period of time . i liked his style of writing with a story told from a different point of view .
just came across this author and loved it ! mad that story was so short , but was great nonetheless would definitely read something else by this author
i really love james patterson books . this book was a excellent read and leaves you on the edge and can not wait for the next release .
falling too far is amazing . abbi has her readers begging for more with this one . rounded characters , captivating story line , and just the right amount of twist and turns .
this book is by far my favorite in the series . it is a page turner ! i could not put it down until i finished !
one of the best books in one of the best suspense series ever . this series really took off with this book .
unique approach to a much used theme . good writing , keeps you involved . character development a little slow , but it builds
great story , great humor , great character ... i thoroughly enjoyed this entire book ! i like witty characters in books and this one sure had wit ! i will definitely read book 2 .
i 've wanted this book a long time . i am so glad bought it . it is a one stop reference that i 'm finding so useful . wish i had known this wonderful lady .
great ! i started reading this series of books when it first came out . it was great to begin reading this series again .
the ending of this one kind of shocked me but it was well done and added so much more depth to the story . still love this series !
i really enjoyed this story and it was a free book . i love to find a new author that way . i will be looking for any other books written her .

patterson comes up with another great twist . how cross found this one is amazing . a very good read .
a good mystery story . i really enjoyed it . it is a dark and has a nice twist at the end . will look into reading more by this author .

this was an excellent end to a series . i enjoyed it just as i have the previous titles . keep doing what you 're doing because it 's working .
there was more detail from the british days than i was interested in . maybe someday i will go back to it . it 's still on my kindle .
this book has a formula in it that helps us make meals for our dog and we can feel confident he is getting proper nutrition .
i have read the whole series and out of them all this one is incredible i very impressed i love this book it 's beautiful and romantic i 'm in love
do not waste your 99 cents on this ! ! i ca n't believe amazon would even offer this for anything more than free , it 's like a review of a book , not a book .
what can i say ? it is the bible . i like the king james version because that is the translation i grew up with . the familiar words are comforting .
the book was very well written , holds your interest and makes you want to keep reading . very enjoyable . i would recommend it .
i could take it or leave it , was a nice enough story but very little depth to the characters . light read but nothing more
this could be better and have better tips to fill in the the pages . i would not get it again .
as always , i can not put down a book where a mystery written by patterson is taking place ! ! i look forward to all of his books .
good read , enjoyed how the story developed , and the changes that took places in each character as how each one grew in their walk .
slow starter , but it is an amazing book . i cared so much about these incredibly written characters . it is a heartfelt read
it is so small on my kindle that it is n't fun to read or listen to for my son . we decided to get a real book instead

very good book , hard to put down but yet hard to believe this happened . a book everyone should read and pass around .

read this one first and love it sending for all the books to read them .

i enjoyed the book as it portrayed women doing jobs and living lives that they had not expected to do .
it was so surprising to me to find out how complex the maya society was . to learn that about their wars , their kings , and their complex religion was fascinating . the illustrations were excellent .

a lovely story about an amazing man at an amazing time . we need him , and more just like him , now ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
the book is easy reading , yet holds you in suspense . i 'll probably buy another book in the series . the characters are unique and well developed .

this is one of the best books that i have ever read . i could not put it down . i am looking forward to my next sandra brown novel . highly , highly recommend this book !
the book was a good reading but seemed more interested in shocking the reader with gory details than providing a compelling story .
went through the book , it is a little more complicated than i expected it would be . other than that it is a well written book .
so sad to think that any human had to go through what the slaves went through , hope we never see a day like that again in our lives . very good reading .
i liked this installment , you are dropped right into action and it continues to the end . good fun plot . worth the money and time . already waiting on the next one .
this book is the first in a series by evans . it explores what happens to a man when he literally loses everything that is precious to him . it gives you a lot to think about .

i highly enjoyed this novel by a pretty good author . i have read others by him and enjoyed them all . i look forward to the next ones .
enjoyable reading . nothing great . i always enjoy dog stories and mysteries but this one was n't memorable . just a nice quick read .
this book is okay . it is very simple , maybe quite boring , but for a halloween book meant for babies , it 's not too bad .
inspiring for a person who has a weight problem . who could believe that a high school romance could so effect a person 's adult life .
summer vampire reading at its best . good character backgrounds lots of action . and of course with any vampire story a love story
my granddaughter really liked this book and wants more . that will be later . thank you for sending it so promptly .
a wonderfully compassionate book . it is a book every woman should read because someday we all could use a & # 34 ; sisterhood & # 34 ; to carry us through .
i loved this story ; it lived up to her other books i have read . if you like futuristic vampire romance with a lot of action thrown in . you will love this story .
ca n't wait for book 3. i really got to feel like i knew the characters and was always sad when someone i had come to enjoy reading about did not ' make it ' .

i love the whole series . great character and adventure . the two main characters are very likeable and well developed . the time period is very interesting .
this book kept my interest from beginning to end . there are many characters in this story which shows that it usually takes more than one to complete any task , good or bad .
another great read . lee and reacher never fail to keep your interest at a super high level . i just loved it !
received it promptly and took it on vacation with me , it was in perfect condition and a great read

bought this on a whim and it was surprisingly good . held my attention throughout and drew me into the characters . will definitely read more by this author .
i have read all of the j.d . robb books and they have all been excellent . my only complaint is they are too short
great book for beginners that are planning on visiting one of these countries . overall this is a top notch book with top notch information .
they are pretty good but not quite what i had expected . if that is not 9 or more words , i guess i ca n't count .
i loved it . i was a great story i had everything i enjoyed . i made me cry and made me laugh . awesome series .

this book is very encouraging and helpful even if you never had the same life experiences as the author .
i liked it and i didnt , sometimes it was hard to follow , i did jump chapters and the plot was kind of hard to follow , but i still liked it
the book was very romantic and enjoyable . the heroine is strong and likeable . i look forward to reading the rest of the series .
it 's a good book my wife will enjoy this book i bought this for her for christmas she other books in this series
not a lot of depth but who wants that in a love story . reads like a funny story of romance , but fills your heart music .
i really liked this book because of the adventures jay and his friends go on . but the bad thing is that it is not that long .
the premise is good but the book read poorly , a lot of grammar mistakes and i do n't believe it was proof read ! ! !
i 've never read this author 's work before . ca n't wait to read more of her novels . i 'm hooked on her now .
interesting , had a good pace to it . i liked the characters . not the type of story i would normally read but i was surprised at how enjoyable it was .
very light love story with an interesting plot . trials finally get the family back together again . very good , easy reading
it 's a typical story with below average writing . makes me want to write my own book . would n't recommend this to anyone .
at first it was boring but i kept on reading then i could n't put the kindle down . then i got the next book and i 'm going to order the third one put it down .
this book is not an easy read . it a collection of experiences encountered by the author but the flow tends to be all over the place .
good book but the way its written its hard to keep reading it . good but dont know if i would read it again
a lot of great authors and great stories that are as fun and serious as anyone could want of them .
i love time travel books and this one was funny and intriguing and kept you captive . take time to read this book .
good plot if a little drawn out at times and of course as with this type of book completely predictable . great for long plane flight
wow another amazing book . could not put it down . such a heart warm story . when i read lisa 's books it is so well written it is like i am right there . a must read
i wanted something along the lines of kindle fire for dummies , i suppose . i still look at it occasionally as a reference .
two stories at once as always ; the brutal and the beautiful . i would have to stop reading on the train because i would start crying at certain points in the book . excellent read .
i have n't had a chance to look at the book yet . it looks like its in excellent condition . hope to get to the read the book soon .
a well written story with many twists and unexpected turns . this book is well worth the time to read and enjoy it .

i have n't read the book yet . i gave it to my mother as a gift . she loved it ! says she did n't want it to end . i ca n't wait to get it back .
i really could have passed on this one . the writing is fine , but there was nothing in this story that pulled me in . it 's not awful , but it is just blah .
i was excited to finally get a novel from zane . however this story was a big disappointment . i thought it was completely unrealistic . i found myself skipping through the pages to finish it .
it is a simple little books with some great recipes . it did make me wish that it had pictures of the food , but that can be kind of tough on a e format .
i love this book and i ca n't wait for the follow up . my friend told me that this is the first in a series , so i am looking forward to the next installment ! !

it is a heartbreaking story . it is a story about a surprising love that really moves you . i would recommend this to a friend .
i had to read this book for school . it was okay , it was an easy read and very informative .
one of the great political novels i have read . plus the hunt for the bad guys just added a greater plot to the story . loved it .
even though there are over 30 books in her `` in death '' series , each one is fresh and different and riveting .
not a stephen king fan normally but i definitely enjoyed this book . i did n't want to wait until the end of the series
i have been looking for the everywhere and finally found it . loved all the different designs that was in it . would definately order from again .
i 've read 2 of this series now and have enjoyed both of them . would recommend it to anyone who enjoys action adventure books .
i think & # 34 ; always yours & # 34 ; was a good old fashion love story and it was good to read a plot with a different setting than i 'm used to reading .
this is a really great start to a series that i hope will open my mind up to something new and exciting ... .. good job

i love the twist and turns of david baldacci novels and king and maxwell are the first books i read some years ago . i really like this book and would recommend it to anyone .
it was an okay book to read i was n't really into it i was expecting more or i guess i did n't feel the chemistry
even without the divorce a lot to relate to . hard to find main characters over 40 you can relate to .
this was a lovely book , i would recommend that you read it great story line and characters . plus you learn a little something about autism .
thought this book moved too slow . it seemed like the main character was stuck . i finished it , but only because i thought it might get moving .
i cried but was happy at the end . i did n't want the story to end though it was that good . re-read it again , right after finishing it .
really like this book . full of suspense and romance . full of surprises till the very end . ca n't wait to read more of her books .
what 's to say . it is written by john sandford . this one has a great twist to it and is great to read on a late night when you ca n't sleep .
we all have demons in our lives . but the demons to come in our future are not the same as now . we are going to have to be stronger than ever before .
again i cant rate this cause i send it to my son but from what he tells me he really likes it
this book was written well . you could have made it more interesting . overall i think it was a good book .
a well written adventure about our indians , our landscape , and one man 's vision . the geography of our west coast could be very very different !
this book was fantastic . loved the idea of breath being magical . i could n't put it down . anxiously waiting to see series continue .
another great book by sandra brown . she just keeps getting better . i enjoyed every page , ca n't wait for her next book .
i enjoyed the book but would have liked a little more history as part of the plot . but it was interesting enough for me to look into the sequels .
this book kept me interested with the first sentence . i never knew this story before . now i want to share it with everyone .
good clean story . it is one of those stories where you know , but ca n't prove it yet until the end .
i enjoyed this book . i liked how it ended . i would read more of them as i would like to see how the two sister make out on their own etc .
this book is a definite 5 star read . if you have n't read it , your missing out . it makes you wonder & look at your man and friends .
of how we are with our dogs . i agree as i cried through this book . it 's a short story but it 's details we 're amazing ... i loved it
decent read and you are reading the rest of the books in the series so read this . least favorite in the series .
this is a very heart touching book . unexpected events make it more interesting and humorous . buy it ! ! you wo n't regret it .
i thought this was a great book . i love the characters and how well everything was put together . i could n't put it down until i finished it .

so i will have to do an update on this book . so far it looks great , very colorful book . pretty .
this book kept your interest it was a easy read and very relaxing a good weekend book very entertaining perfect
i just finished this book and i am totally satisfied . it 's like i had a great meal .
this book has some interesting and useful things from the past . i found some things that i thought were odd , but those were different times . i recommend .
the plot was very predictable , and the characters were very unrealistic . it was n't a believable story . no character development , just fell fast into love and into bed .
i was very curious about this book and had to get it . i do not regret it . this is a must read !
very erotic the kind i enjoy . the story line was entertaining . the description and the attention to detail is delightful !
i loved this story . it started a little slow for me , but started getting interesting quickly . i would absolutely recommend it to others .
the hidden is a well constructed book that cleverly weaves two tales of women fighting for justice . a little slow going at first but grabs you till you ca n't wait to see how it ends .
this was an amazing book ! i was upset when i had to put it down to get some sleep . this author has definitely made a fan out of me !
i have a lot of slow cooker recipes and so i was happy to see this one which had some new ideas i have n't seen before .
a very favorite childhood classic book . my grand kids love the story as well . they will listen to it year round ! !
it was good but a little boring and it felt like things were repeating themselves . it was a little to intimate for my taste .
this has been of of the best stories . the multiple plots added a lot to this book . keep up the multiple plot adventures .
great story about lies and the choices you have in life to overcome obstacles and be a better person in the end
a lovely and endearing novel which slowly pulled me into its twists and turns . i did n't want it to end .
do n't know if this is a first book or not but it is a good story . it 's a little slow in parts by fun . the ending is a bit contrived and did n't satisfy .
have read the complete series and was not disappointed with any of the books . i recommended them to my friends
picked this up and did not stop until the end ! ! great read ... great author ... will be looking for more this author does not disappoint
i have never been interested in electronic games but this story made me want to be . the story keeps you captive to the end .
this book was a great read and enjoyable story line , a little slow in some places but overall a good book to read .
the book is ok. but it was read to fast for my five year old . he could n't keep up or follow along .
very moving story of a father and son and to love or not to love . can true love really last a lifetime and beyond ?
i have loved this book for years ! glad it is in the kindle format . read a chapter a day and your faith will increase .
i would have enjoyed all versions of these characters , and story . but ... ... i 'm glad i read the one you felt was the way you felt it in your heart and head .
this was okay for just a quick read . i will consider buying her next novel though i doubt that i will recommend this to my friends .
the book was good in parts but the storyline was too mixed up and it was hard at times to know where you were and who the author was talking about .
this story starts out a little slow , but when they start on their adventure you ca n't put it down . i am hooked .
if you love fifty shades of grey , you 'll love this series ! i already pre ordered the next book ! ca n't wait to read it !
i really enjoyed this series . the mother was no joke . these were worth reading . i kind of wish there was more .
really not my cup of tea . maybe i 'm just too old , but it was stilted and obviously written for a younger audience .
i so enjoyed reading this book . it relates very well to our lives ... prejudice , finding the virgin mary in all , and about slavery .
enjoyed this book . while there is a thread of sadness in the story , the basic pattern of faith in goodness . nicely written .
great read keeps you turning the page . loved the mix of suspense , romance , and faith . recommend this read for sure
found this book to be hard to follow and focused more on working women with children . would have liked to see her expand to many different types of women and not just moms .
i borrowed this as a prime member , and enjoyed it so much i ended up paying for it . well done .
this story was good , but the ending was strange , almost like the author just got tired of writing the story and gave it a quick ending . bizarre .

this book is an eye opener . amazing . i have a new outlook on life and death . you have to read it
this is by far one of the better books i 've read recently . i not only got drawn into the story , but i was emotionally involved throughout reading it . i highly recommend it !
there was a lot of religious imagery in this book ... well , obviously , as that is the whole point of the book . some sick things happen , which i enjoyed .
a good sense of the social structure of women 's place in the & # 34 ; family & # 34 ; one wise women is the protagonist . a well crafted and good read .
this is definitely not for the faint of heart . i could n't stop reading ... the 1st , 2nd , 3rd ... and i am eagerly awaiting the 4th ! bring it on .

i am in love with fairy tales , but after awhile you get sick of all the happy endings . this is the perfect solution . this is how the fairy tales you hear today were originally written .
it 's a nice entertainment to read this story and the idea to talk through flowers is new but the characters are not that intricate .

i really like this set of books ... but it really could have been just one book or maybe two . hope i do n't have to wait to long for the last one .
i liked the story and the characters were good but it was a little to teen for me but it was free and a nice long story unlike many of the short stories that are put out now .

the story was not enticing and did n't keep my attention past the first few pages would not recommend is just not a book that grabs you
love the story it was full of twists and turns . i recommended to any one who like action with romance .

it has been a really useful book for a beginner in manga like me . i just wish there were more examples but i have been using it a lot as reference . it 's worth the price .

i was in a bad place when i read this book , but after i was able to find many things in my life to be thankful for .
it was a good read overall . it was a little bit of a slow start on the story but it got better
an excellently written story that i just simply could n't put down . i finished it within two days . definitely worth reading !
marcus , i loved your point of view in this book . it had a fantastic reality to it . it was a very smooth reading for my enjoyment .
all the books in this series have been a very enjoyable read . the detail is good enough to make a reader feel like they are right there with the characters .
the book was `` ca n't put it down '' spellbinding . i realized early on that there were no good guys , they were all equally crazy . the ending left me hanging however ...
good book , but to me hard to read due to sooooo much detail . should have bought the `` cliff notes '' version .
i could n't put the book down . i think it was well written . i smiled all throughout the book . i will not give any clue to the plot but know that this is the best .
this book is quick reading and is an enjoyable story . this has a spy basis , so it is not all romance and keeps your interest .
this book was purchased on my kindle for my husband . he does n't like to read , but loves this book . fast transaction right on my kindle !
sorry , but this one was not very good . if i had paid money to read i would have requested a refund from the author .
i thought this one was a pretty good book , though it did n't talk a whole lot about the murders . it had more romance than mystery in it which made the cover a little misleading .
this book was compelling and intriguing . kept you guessing and yet knowing . it is an excellent read that 's for sure .
adult read for adults who are in to the series recommend highly ca n't wait for the next one of the series a hard to put down a must read
i 'm a debbie m fan from way back and she just keeps getting better and better . i wonder why i even spend time on debut novels anymore when i can just read hers ! !

this was a great story line kept me reading it and i could n't put it down . hope the next book is as good .
this is the 4th time i 've read this book and honestly i ca n't help myself i just wish it was a movie cause if it was i would so go to see it a million times over
good read though some characters are a bit far fetched . the hero is a little too heroic but it all comes together in the end . recommended for those who enjoy political intrigue .
shipped the book as promised . lee child is a great author . the book was what i expected and more - action packed .
of course most books are better than the movie so that is no surprise , but i really enjoyed the writing and flow of the book as well as the little details the movie did not touch upon .
quick and easy read but it 's worth your time . it 's a great follow-up to divergent . i ca n't wait for the last installment .
a definitely unusual and fresh twist on shifter stories . i like this . it 's a lot less shallow than other shifter stories .
this book definitely held my interest to the end . the characters were very interesting and the story was unusual and not predictable .
cute short story i found it enjoyable . will check more of her books out in the future . have n't read the first one in this series probably should before this one .

i thought this was a book done by louis l'amour instead it is a book done buy somebody talking about books done by l'amour , with the l'amour 's book at the end .

started this book a few days ago , on book 3 now . i 'm thoroughly enjoying this series and intend to buy the rest as i get to them .
take a minute or two and dive into your greatest self . ponder , reveal , and evolve with this excellent addition to your daily spiritual practice .

title story was good . other two short stories included in book were odd , especially the second one . first story was a worthwhile read , but glad i got the book as a freebie .
this book is very cute and gives a good overview for kids . it is geared towards younger kids though . not exactly what you might want if you have a little bit older child .

good read , fast paced , good plot line , funny , sad , good range of emotions . author good command of words and humor .

keeps you guessing . a good male to female tension ! some situations are a bit & # 34 ; out there & # 34 ; but who cares ; it 's fun !
a wonderful novel and with good reading from clive cussler . all his novels seem to always include the ocean , which is mystery in its own .
this is a nice quick read with an exciting feel good ending . would definitely recommend to anyone that enjoy reading fictional drama with a hit of romance .
do n't know it there is more to it , but i only have a few pages and have tried a number of times to re load it . disappointed that there is n't more of a story there .
an interesting blog . good motivational encouragement . however , not a good plan for everyone . i hope tim can maintain his weight loss .

i gave it as a gift and she said that she loved the book and it was the kind of book that you could enjoy more than once .
loves the characters and how they developed . you find yourself unable to put the book down . mature readers only due to graphic sex acts .
a book for a quick read . kept me interested . nothing extraordinary but the plot was nice . i enjoyed it for the night .
my heart went out to katie and the suffering she endured by her father . i could not put her book down .

this book as enough steam to keep the summer heat . hope to read more by this author . has turns and twists . you will not want it to end
i was expecting fluff , but this book was much deeper than expected . there was some great , steamy sex , but the romance was there , too . i 'd definitely recommend this .
great series ! all characters are in each book . which makes it come more together . strong men and beautiful women . hot romance scenes ! what more would you want ? !
yet another book that has so much sexual content that could have been left out . story line was excellent but too much smut .
but anyone who treats their children the way linda treated hannah need not have children . this book also could have easily been about 100 pages shorter .
although the concepts presented are by no means novel , the compilation of cases is very good . i 'm sure i 'll read it again .
i found this story to be interesting and captivating . would like very much to see the story continue to its conclusion .
i really enjoyed the book . there is an amazing level of detail . however , it requires a commitment to finish the book because of that detail .
not just another diet - not really a diet at all . whether you need to lose weight or not , this book could change your life . buy it !

always a good fast paced read . i read it twice and i liked it both times . i have said enough .
i absolutely loved this book the connection they had right from the start was amazing . i could n't put it down . this is a must read .
it was a nice short story . not even a novella . the story had potential to keep going and be a good story , or novella . but it just stopped . not worth the 99 cents .
you have to read the book ! i have n't seen the movie , but i can not imagine how it could possibly do justice to the written word . this is an incredibly powerful book .

i enjoyed this book as much as the last one she wrote . very creepy killer ! interesting storyline and characters in it .
i loved this book . i did not see the movie , so maybe that was good . it has many twists and turns , and makes you want more .
i think this book taught that sometimes when you do n't feel worthy , you might be wrong . very interesting book with a good lesson and had a good sense of humor in it .
a classic retelling of wonderful myths ! i read this many years ago and loved it then as well as now .
this book was much better it had heart romance and the sex scenes was a lot better than the first book . just needs a little bit more and you will have the perfect book .
a great read . it was packed full of a variety of stories , puzzles , random facts and so much more . got it for free so that was a bonus . some worthwhile material in here .
bought it as a present for a friend 's kid ! he really enjoyed it , mostly because of the cd so that he could listen while looking at the wonderful drawings !
this was a good story and the author obviously did his homework but there were times when i thought i would never get to the end .
it did n't seem as whimsical as the movie , but the story was very nice . i feel like it gave a little more insight to the characters and the story then the movie had .
the characters are so real that you feel you know them , and when the story ends you feel as though you have lost friends
well written , with a good sense of how conversation works in the military . i wish it had been longer ; it was such a good story .
this is my favorite book in the whole world . i fell in love with this book instantly . it 's an amazing book that everyone should read .
not the best anne rice vampire book . had a lot of story history , but for an entertainment read , her other titles in the series are better .
loved the earlier books . this one just is n't up to the quality of the first three . hope to see another .

i was impressed with most of the stories ... i had enjoyed the quick read of the short stories ... . the authors have done well

this was outstanding reading . highly recommended . no spoilers here . but i will say great story line , humor , character development . hope to read more from this author .
i knew where this book was going from pretty early on and while it explores eastern legends , it is nowhere near half as good as the book it tries to copy .
i would not have thought this was a first novel . it was well written . the characters were well developed and had a well thought out plot . very believable story line . read and enjoy ! ! !
this book only has about 50 pages of actual content , the rest is repetitive , badly edited fluff .

i liked it even though it was a all age book it was complex and entertaining . will be reading the next book .
a great ending to the shadow vampire series . i love the mix of romance and paranormal . a fast read too .
a rather predictable plot with a `` happily ever after ending . '' the main character is well drawn . light summer read with more than a little romance thrown in .
this is a great romance story . has a wonderful combo of humor with romance . i would suggest this to anyone craving a great laugh with hot steamy romance .

sort of like reading a bad book , it just wo n't get better but once you 've begun you ca n't stand to stop .
this book spent a lot of time describing the backgrounds of the five men . they were not in actual battles very long . however , the battles they were in were very brutal .

the plot needs to be updated . character development was weak along with the story . not the typical coben fine read .

this book was fun to read and kept your attention . it is n't great literature , but then , i did n't expect it to be . i thoroughly enjoyed reading it .

i just ca n't get enough of private . ca n't wait to see where private goes next . i have enjoyed all of the ones out .
way too short . i was left wanting more and not with the way it ended . i was a good read , i just wanted more .
this story was too boring , and just not told well by the author . it had potential but just fell flat .
this actually kind of read more like an action movie in my head , it was a good read , definitely going to keep reading this series .
i 've read many of debra white smith 's books in the past but this is truly one of my favorites . this new series based on jane austen 's novels is refreshing and entertaining !

i liked the way he created the flow of the story . not the best in the world , but the characters were pretty well rounded out .
cindy has become one of my fav authors . loved both stories . great love stories . waiting to see what the next adventure and journey will bring .
very nice to see the girl finally taking charge and winning him over . great humor thrown into the mix . well done ! ! ! cant wait for the next one
excellent effort for the first of a series . it was a quick and exciting read which kept me enthralled throughout the read .
a great entertaining story ! very uplifting and perfect for bringing a smile to your face while satisfying the romantic side of your nature ! i thoroughly enjoyed reading this story that had just a touch of the paranormal .
this is a great book with a lot of information . it is definitely worth adding to your bookshelf at home .
this book was a great read . it was n't just about animals but also the author . recommended .
see my other review about & # 34 ; kill shot & # 34 ; it is the same idea . vince flynn is a safe read if a little over priced .
this is one of the best books i 've read this year . it 's even better than the first book . i ca n't wait for # 3 ! ! ! !
just as described - save this seller - and make sure you have their links for your next buy like this one .
i am really loving how mercy and the other characters are developing . each book keeps getting better and better . keep up the great writing !
a page turner ... i could n't put this book down once i started it . nobody does action like griffin . nobody does sexual attraction like griffin ... hot stuff !
picked up book 4 at a book store without realizing it was the 4th in a series . once i discovered my happy mistake i bought books one through three on amazon . happy reading !
this was a great story . i loved it so so much . i can not wait to read the next one . hurry please ...
exciting , thrilling , and no way to figure what is going to happen next ! will be waiting for the next episode ! ! !
thank you , thank you , thank you . not only an excellently written book but well researched and informative . overall a great read . 5 stars
this book is great and i read all of the series . all of the books in the series are very quick reads .
i would refer this book to my friends . mysteries and thriller and historical are my choices . the book currently that i am reading is good & # 34 ; nick of time & # 34 ;
very good story . loved the story line and characters . i would recommend this to any romantic at heart . i will read it again .
i enjoy the stories and the humor . once i got into it it moved pretty fast with a few unexpected turns ... enjoy ! ! ! !
i would recommend this series to everyone who enjoys a book that leaves you hanging on from page one till the end
i loved the book and could not put the book down . i would recommended this book and other books by baldacci .
this book from amazon came in great condition and within a reasonable amount of time . it was part of a present for someone and he really loved adding it to his collection of stephen king books .
a good read , had some good parts could have used a little more character development . all in all i would recommend it .
i truly was held captive by the storyline . the author kept me in suspense down to the final chapter . definitely a good read .
this book is for those who wants to teach their student or children very basic drawing .
cute book with a few twists and turns . the ending is pretty predictable as you read . great book for a fun read .
i must say this was very slow moving in my opinion it could have move a little bit faster in telling the story i have read enough that this could have moved faster .
ok for small children but nothing exceptional . cute animal pictures you can find lots of places . would have liked to have seen a few descriptions that encouraged children to explore
best book i 've read all year ! i loved and hated the characters , which is what the author wants , i think . great story ... i could n't put it down .
enjoyed reading this book , , in fact read it in one setting . each chapter kept my interest wondering what else could happen .
waiting for the next one to read . keep the story going . good plot & story line . now i need to read your other books
liked the book . bought second chances and read it too . while it was not a christian romance , it was clean reading .
the main character is a bit strange , but keeps things interesting . i recommend this book as long as you can handle it in fun .
once again i 'm left with my mouth hanging open . the drama was so good and i definitely will read the next book .
suggest you read these books in sequence ... although they are stand alone , it 's best to get the context of the previous books .
totally awesome . everyone should read it . i 've read the first book and loved it . take it from me you should read it .
the book is a fun book with a story . i read 50 shades of grey and i think this was a little better .
loved this book ! ! so good . it did n't go as i thought it would but it was awesome ! i need more ! ! ! i need a therapist like alexander ; )
fun but a little hard to follow . worth reading . interesting how each of the stories are intertwined but you do n't realize it until the end . nice twist .
this was an okay read . there was a lot going on with each character , everyone had some kind of drama going on . looking forward to book 3 to find out what happens to everyone .
wasnt sure at first , but turned out better than i thought . the ending had an interesting twist . cant wait for the next book .
love these first 2 books . adventure , drama , friendship , betrayal and more . should be made into movies , can not wait to read the last one .
great book for kids to help them accept themselves and love themselves for who they are . highly recommend it if you have little children .
another hard to put down story by t l gray . enjoyed jake 's story as much as i did her first book . a must read .
if you read the first one you will not like this one . a lot of things that happened are truly out of this world .
this is on our kindle ... very helpful , easy to read , clear discussion ... your will need this at some point ! and be very happy you have it ! ! !
once i started it , it was hard to stop ! loved the story & characters . it 's was a very good book .
i could n't get enough of this book ! it was so amazing i could not put it down . i totally suggest reading it !
another excellent installment in the blood bound series . the action and romance keeps you turning the pages . i ca n't wait for the next book !
i did n't realize stephen king wrote anything but horror and was very pleasantly surprised by this book . it kept me turning the pages and i would recommend it to all my friends .
very , very cute ... we have all fancy nancy books ... this one was read a couple nights a week for months .
i love her books and i know i will get accurate information about the period she writes about . her prose is so very interesting .
love the character of dresden . complicated yet a very real personality . the twists and turns are wonderful . ca n't wait to read more .
this girl really loves this guy and i am not sure how it is gon na end , but i hope it has a happy ending
this book just could n't grab my attention . i do n't think i read past the first few chapters . i may revisit it again at some point to see if that changes .
i loved this book i loved the story line and how the arthur wrote it . it was great i would read it again and looking forward to more by this arthur . thanks
1st of series , good read , hard to put down . exciting story with good characters some one for all to relate to
these cards are sturdy , and they are great for building a child 's vocabulary . i use them in my speech therapy practice with young children .

a romantic story with some humor written into it . i love the storyline . i will be reading more by this author .
a very fast-paced exciting thriller with a plot that makes it hard to suspend disbelief but keeps you reading anyway .
this was a very enjoyable read with very likable characters and a smooth plot . this is a great story that is told well !
good concept . not her best book by any means , however i still enjoyed it . as always , jodi picoult has an incredible talent for describing difficult life situations .
i enjoyed the he 'll out of this book . every word , every chapter had me compelled and wanting more . their story was so intense and loving and heartbreaking at the same time .
like the story line , but it is different from what i normally like w/ paranormal romance in a good way .
i did n't like the diary format to begin with , but it grew on me . i especially like that the character 's sense of humor really came through the writing .
i could n't put this book down , loved how they mixed a story of the past with the present . the story was easy to get caught up in
i loved this book and the 2 before it . what an incredible love story ! the sex scenes were very good !
excellent guidelines for a new life style change . it explained all the medical benefits to change you life . very complete and informative
the book started out slow but once it picked up i could n't put it down . after finishing it i totally understand why she had to explain everything . ca n't wit o read he next one !
once again , i am satisfied . i love emily 's writing plain and simple . her spot on descriptions and characters draw me in . mostly realistic . her writing leaves nothing to be desired ...
this is such a great book , can not wait to read the next one . definitely take a chance with this author , she is great !
only a few spots where the story line got confusing . nice twists and turns . never boring and i found myself thinking about it when i was n't reading . the mark of a good book !
great book . this is the first book i have read by this author . plan to read many more . good job
as a big baldacci fan i look forward to his new books . this one left me wanting more . the characters were thin and the plot fairly predictable
this book was good ! super funny and so worth buying . this is a really good christian book but i think it have had a little more depth to it
i enjoyed this book . i actually did n't see the twist coming , so for me that made it much more enjoyable . i think it 's definitely worth reading .
this is my `` go to '' series ! great read ! i love coming of age stories and this is a great intro in to the lives of the crew .
i really enjoyed reading this love story . it was exciting and i did not wanted to put down , i recommend everyone to read it ,
was looking forward to more . the characters could have been more interesting . did n't really keep my attention so probably wo n't read it again .
it 's ok but was n't what i thought it would be . was hoping it would have had recipes using these foods .
i always enjoy nora roberts and this one did not let me down . interesting plot . it kept the suspense going .
this was a quick read and had a good story line . it was very predictable , but i enjoyed it none the less .
i have read all the sookie books and this one is just as much of a roller coaster ride as any of them . now that the series is over , i plan to re-read all of them .
i loved the book so much i had to get the other book she wrote and could hardly put it down . i would probably consider getting more books from this author , , ,
great story . i read the 1st and 2nd book and the were go also . i enjoy reading them and so i download them on my kindle fire
this book came on time , and in new condition . it was also just as exciting as the other books in this series and i was happy with the way this book ended .
real . suspenseful . non-stop action . builds up until it 's hard to put down . detective mystery lovers have one more to love .
the book was okay . had a lot of funny parts but just could n't keep me interested more than 30 minutes at a time .
this book changed my life and made me cry more than once ! so many great lessons can be learned from this book .
you only understand it if you have read the first one middle school get me out of here . it was okay
love this series so very much ! ! ! ! can not wait til the third book ! ! ! i have been checking everyday ! ! very well worth buying the series ! ! !
this was a great quick read that couldnt be put down ! great writing ! i will definitely be looking out for more from this author !
this was ok. did not find it as good as most of the sisterhood books . did find there are new characters and perhaps something in the future will be built on them .
going back to civil war era and the coming to the present was very interesting . i would love to see this as a movie ,
needs to have more details , i thought she would let him know how she ended the book . makes you want the next book..
i especially enjoyed the descriptions of each character 's thoughts and emotions . they were plausible as well as realistic , making it easy for the reader to identify with the characters themselves .
the story line of this book was interesting and different than a lot of books i have read lately . i enjoyed it and am happy that it is part of a series .
good short read that keeps you interested . well rounded characters . some typos get in the way but otherwise a solid read for those times when you just want to read something fun .
great book with wonderful pictures ! ! it was such a great help to identify the animals and put a name to them .
i thought the storyline was good , but i ca n't say that i really connected with the characters all that much . it felt a bit ... rushed ? it was a quick , easy read though .
i like this story very much the characters were very good , i wish the ending was a little different ... but overall i really thought it was good .
for me , this was just an okay book in the dead man series . it was different from the others , and the story did move at a decent pace .
this is one of my very favorite books ! if you like historical fiction you will really enjoy this book .
great follow up to the first book . keeps you reading . looking forward to the next one . fiction that has real roots .
sanford has created virgil flowers and has made him an endearing character , do n't miss even one of these books . enjoy
touching story and funny at times . i did finish the book , even though i knew where the story was heading
another golden series by one of my favorite authors . i can not wait to finish the series and am even more anxious to read what she writes next .
short , engrossing story with a surprise ( like most of grisham 's novels ) ending . overall , if you are baseball fan you will enjoy reading this book .
this book contains a lot of out of date stuff . found a few useful tips but overall not worth it .
the writing is only mediocre and the story very predictable . jane austen did it better ! it was slightly entertaining with good characters .
i loved it . liked that tessa was in another book . it was great . really loved the ending . ca n't wait for the next one !
i am going crazy for the the next book . man this is a great book if your looking for a awesome book to read this book

this was one of my first cookbooks purchased as a vegan . have loved everything i have made from this book ! i like the layout and the pictures in this cookbook .
this was a classroom purchase . i enjoyed the story and wanted my students to be able to read it . i have other books by the same author .
a little bit of everything keeps you coming back to pick up the book -- suspense , mystery , beautiful women and handsome men , plus some nice romance thrown in ,
i like the descriptive writing of how tolkien 's world was created . still reading and will write more when i have time .
i love finding out what is going to happen next . i try to figure it out ahead of time , but usually ca n't . it really keeps me on the edge on my seat .
at first i did n't think i would like this cd but after listening a few times it does deliver the technique for meditation .
this book had me on the edge of my seat most of the way through . again , barely able to put it down once i got started on it .
lily is a story about a hopeless romantic who loves her man in spite of everything he does to her . love is truly blind in this novel .
this has a lot of good information inside . some of the chapters seemed a little dry ; i was hoping for a more accessible treatment .
this book is great , i totally loved this book and series . you should read this series . you will love it .
this story definitely did n't keep me up at night . it was entertaining , but not riveting . if you want to an easy romance , this is a good choice .
i gave this one five stars as i have the others that i read because i simply can not put them down . good writing and a great story with believable characters .
i love alternate universe stories ! this one is way too short , and a little light on imagination , but i still liked it .
was a very different type of story . a little hard to follow . however , i would recommend it to those who love a good mystery .
this book is totally amazing . loved it . i ca n't wait for the next books to come out . def recommend reading it .
ok but rather slow and too much repeating . it could have been a better story with less repeating . like the cover .
this book captured my interest from start to finish . it keeps you on edge . great read ! i would definitely recommend it .
this book totally captivated me . i am soooo hooked . i ca n't wait for the second one . this book left me begging for more . i could n't put it down . loved it !
i would have been happier if the characters had been more developed and the scenes a little more explained . i enjoyed it , but would have been ready to accept the ending easier with a little more depth .
started this book but could n't complete it ! opening paragraph failed to hold my interest as main character personalities seemed shallow .
this book is a no nonsense look at getting your book noticed by kindle and improve sales . i had 2 people recommend this book to me , and i was very pleased with my purchase
i love the illustrations and the stories are adorable , except the one about the ghost . i would n't read anything about ghosts to a child . other than that i like this little book .
it may appeal to others but not my cup of tea . to dark a storyline . i could not relate in any way to the people in the book .
normally i say i 'll read anything , but i did not read beyond the first chapter of this book . i just was n't `` sucked in '' by the characters or the storyline .
pretty decent story , seemed to drag at times even a little hard to follow but it was still a good scary story
oh boy i can not wait read part 2 ! how can a mother be so ugly to her child ? ! this book was off the hook with twists and turns . five stars from me .
read it in 2 days . i could not put it down . a must read . i loved it what can i say . that is why i chose the rating .
when i went to the book store and saw this i thought it was part of the vampire diaries series , but it wasnt . i loved this book and ca n't wait for the next one ! ! !
i enjoyed this book very much . it had a lot of descriptions of the erotic scenes and i enjoy a good bdsm scene . i look forward to the rest of the series .
first book i 've read by this author . pleasant surprise . i prefer characters with depth and developed family or friendships within the storyline . you 'll see hints of future storylines to come .
i enjoyed this book and am looking forward to buying the next one in the series . great for girls and teens : )
i really enjoyed this book and the humor of the author . i would love to see a sequel and see what happens ? ? ? ?
what a fantastic story . loved the family , what great characters , fell in love with all of them . ca n't wait to read the series .
i loved the twilight books , but the second one was my least favorite . the story was n't as original as the other ones . i guess it is still okay .
thought it would be funnier than it was . it 's not something i would want to read again .
and loved the book . inspiring is the only word to use here . if more teachers were like this , the kids in this country may have more respect for others
it 's hard to put his books down . they are exciting and good reading . i stay riveted to it through the whole book
really good book . the title is not what the book is about , so do n't let it throw you off . really good read .
i enjoyed the story . i liked the fact that she got enjoyment by doing things on her own , and still kept the respect and love of her husband .
love this series . i read this book in two days . love cozy mysteries and the cast of characters in this book .
very funny . i got some background info on one of my favorite funny men and it made me laugh . makes you laugh at the problems of old age .

this books is very well written could be read alone but would seriously recommend reading the 4 other books in this series .

this is my favorite author and i recommend her books to anyone who loves a fairy tale romance ! ! ! ! this was a good one ! i read it in a few days ! ! !
the writing truly held me throughout the book and i literally could not put it down . it is one of the very few books that stay with you long after you 've finished it .

very great read and enjoyed the characters and storyline a lot . this book had lots of excitement to it and very interesting !
i really enjoyed this book . it was predictable but entertaining too . time travel is a favorite topic of mine so i liked reading about it .
i was n't sure about this book , but was pleasantly surprised . i read this quickly then had to go back and get the other books in the series .
son loves books , however because he loves to mouth them ... .this one is being saved for later ... wish it was a board book .
a story lacking in just about everything . i do n't even think i 'll spend any more money on the sequel . not a good read .
a good book with very important information that could save your life . if you are new at the idea this is worth your time .
its a very cute book , and i enjoyed reading it . its a great way to learn more about the culture at the heart of yoga .
better than the first book ( did n't think that was possible ) . lets you enjoy an erotic lifestyle without even leaving the house ! !
no words needed for this story or any others by this author . she 's just the best and each story in each series is 5 star worthy
this is a true feel good , sad , good story . i cant wait to read the next one . you will not be disappointed .
i purchased this as a gift for a family member and , so far , there are n't any issues . many great ideas inside !
great book if you are reading the series in order . probably not so good if not reading them in order
my kind of book . i love the alpha bad boy , city , who is really a caring family guy . this was a great read . i will definitely look into other books by this author .
the target is one of the earlier catherine coulter books of the fbi series . very well written very hard to put down after the first couple of chapters .
well , it 's an ok book . i would liked to have read the index before i bought it , i probably would have looked for another book if i had .
julie smith is a fantastic writer -- -- her characters suck you in and the plot flows like honey . there is always suspense , laughter , and thrills ! ! what more could you ask for ? ? ?
there is n't one bad recipe in this book ! i ca n't wait to bake my way through this well presented , beautiful , cookbook .
good book . funny and romantic . i love a shifter story and this one was really good . ca n't wait for more .
the ending of this book was not what i expected , but it does bring up some interesting questions . if king had stayed around he might have written another series to go with this .
it was so worth reading this book . it was n't as exciting as book 1 & 2 but it was worth reading to know how their love story continues .
the author did it again , another great book in this series . the characters and story line was incredible together . i very much enjoyed reading this book and now going to read the next book .
everyone should read this book , especially if they have seen the disney version on film . the actual story is of course , much better .
it 's a book that i would pick up now and again to look up some interesting fact . have n't finished it but will eventually when i have nothing more interesting to read .

loved it . have been waiting on this book what feels like forever . have really enjoyed the characters and how they have developed . since book one i was hooked on this series .
this short story was very full of action , suspense , and interesting . as a christian suspense novel of course it was very clean which is what i enjoy .

this book is wonderful ! i have learned so much . i am already planning out my garden for the year . definitely recommend !
typical patterson book just did n't work for me . it did n't hold my attention like most patterson books , tough time with characters
was excited to read this being that he was a & # 34 ; porn star & # 34 ; but this had a great story behind it
i love this book . my son loves this book also , which makes it even better ! we love the humor and the illustrations .
very nice good night story for little ones . engaging pictures ... would recommend ..i was able to get the book as a free book of day for my niece .
i give this book 4 stars because this is one of my son 's go to bedtime stories . i recommend this book for 5 yrs old to 7 yrs old .

i love this type of books . a fast good read that keeps you interested . i ca n't wait to read the next book .
i enjoyed the book . after the last 2 books that i read i was expecting this to be a little different . good read though .
this was not what i had expected when i got this book . the personalities of the storyline , and the ending of y story . delicious .
yes ! simple and straight to the point . great tips , simple recipes , easy to follow . easy read too . take notes you will learn something new
i wanted to like the book , i wanted something mindless and entertaining it just fell short , i think it was predictable and kind of boring .
easy read , fun and sexy ! leaves just enough to the imagination to make it you own story . looking forward to reading the rest of the series .
this book was surprisingly well written , especially considering the fact that i paid nothing . give this book , this author , a chance .
this was a required textbook for my government class in college . we have referred to it many times and it has always been a great resource !
i got the very first book in this series for free and then knew i had to buy the rest . hunter moon is the perfect finish to the series .
this was the most awesome book . i ca n't wait to what the next book brings . i will follow every book after this one .
there were lots of hot sex scenes but the characters do not really feel too connected in general . better luck next time .
this book does n't disappoint ! it is good until the very end . i will look forward to the next one ! very enjoyable !
i highly recommend this book ! this author is awesome and once again does n't disappoint . i do n't give 5 stars easily , but this author gets them every time !
i love being able to get the entire series all at once . the story was good and i enjoyed the characters .
this book did not disappoint . i wanted to read it before seeing the movie . however the details surprised me so much that i am not sure the movie will be as effective as the book !
easy read that left you feeling good . short but good . do n't want to tell you too much but if you need a happy story this us for you
after reading one of her books , i quickly discovered how funny and good she was and have since read anything i could get my hands on that she has written . read the series ... it is awesome !

this book is great . i would recommend this for any stage of the relationship . engaged or married for 30 years .
very funny and romantic . i did n't want to stop reading it ! definitely recommend this for those who enjoy romantic comedy .
i was a little disappointed when i got the book ... flipping through the book , there are not lots pictures ... do have lots written information ... maybe i was expected more pictures .
the characters will keep your imagination working that 's for sure . a good blend of fiction and modern day adventures and times . not for everyone but a good read .

this book is full of excitement . it was a great read for those who are into that sort of lifestyle . very detailed and very graphic .
this book had some very good points on what living the fast life can get you . but it is n't realistic at all . it also seems as if no one edited this book at all .

i 've discovered this woman just recently and am now on a mission to read everything she has written thus far .
great book . i 've been using this and a web app to learn some of the basics . it 's pretty fun , i think .
the title says it all ... too predictable , not enough suspense , shallow . wo n't read it again . too much of god also , although this is my personal view .
very sad at times , but worth the read ! i cried when i read about nikki , but it was a great book
not your regular vampire story ... this is a story of war against vampires . the conflict is at once gruesome and moving as you see the flawed of human kind come together to fight a common enemy .
i enjoyed this book . had not read anything by this author before but after reading this i got a couple of others books by her and enjoyed them too . she is a good story teller and writer .

the story line kept me interested , but i wanted it to be longer . it needed something more to make it more captivating .
if you are looking for down home , delicious recipes , this is it ! i 've already made 2 of the recipes and they turned out great . recommend .

interesting stories to be read during the late fall for second graders . some of them seemed to be of more interest than others to my students .
this was surprising since there was no laugh out loud moments and the ending was predictable from the first chapter . hopefully stephanie bond will be able to expand her base but this was not a good beginning .
love the author and thoroughly enjoy alex stone thrillers . always keeps you wanting to read . best series out there .

very good and interesting novel about one of the most powerful woman in history . wonder how she would have made out in modern times .
this very short story is cleverly written entertaining . with further development it could have become more meaningful as well . so so .
so glad they came up with something that really helps when you are at your wit 's end over something that should be simple .
interesting story with a major twist at the end . it was a little slow at times but the ending was a big redeeming factor .
once again , i read the book within days because it was so good and now am sad because its over .
a wonderful story for the fall season . the kids loved it . i do wish we could get our hands on the british english version , but we 'll live with this one !
all the doubts about relationships in the story , and excellent plots , make this tale a delight . i will be following tom closely !

nora roberts hits it out of the park again with this trilogy . it was mysterious , magical and packed with action , adventure and of course , love .
i enjoyed reading love stories with a good mystery in the regency era . i am waiting for the next one in the series .
it was a fun read . and i had no idea that mark twain would make a story about adam . it is a bit of a chuckle and a short read but very interesting read .
i love this series , i have enjoyed every single book . noah was a little different but still awesome . can not wait to the next book ! & lt ; 3
one of my favorite authors does it again . she knows how to find the voice of that era and the right mood between the hero and the heroine .
after reading this , i just had to order book 2. however , book 2 ended with no satisfactory solution , & i am hoping that there is a book 3 in the series .
the second book in the series was much better than the first book . the series and characters are interesting enough that i will definitely read the next book in the series .
i fell in love with this book the story was beautiful and amazing it was one of the best books i have read in a while
lots of food for thought and even if you do n't agree with everything he has to say he does present many fresh ideas and perspectives .
this one is a little more dark than the first three . harry finds himself in more danger in this one but also shows how brave he is and how much he cares for other people .
interesting and romantic what a combination . in like the relationship between the characters as nd their family . nora is my hero
fast read book . clean reading . made me think about how thankful i 'm for all i have . enjoy reading a book that makes me feel good when i 'm done reading it
this story just felt sad through out the narrative . too much like dysfunctional families every where , without a satisfactory solution offered to help the people involved ,
loved it ! great way to escape the real world by reading stories . great fantasies cant wait for the next book
what a page turner . this book started out late but when it did there was no putting it down .
good read . the characters were very believable , and i was anxious to find out how they would find each other or if they would . i am looking forward to reading the next book in the series .
quick reading story . had me hooked from the beginning . i kept waiting for more ... but the story kept on at a nice pace . recommend recommended .
i love this series could n't stop reading it and very sad to see that this is the last . and wow so glad she ended up with zane
a great story about the trials , tribulations & adventures friends go through & the love & support shared between them !
like i said it was an ok book bit boring at first then it got exciting and i liked it
love it , what else can i say , i am waiting for book 4. when will it come in ... hurry up & get it in
the story is great . the ending left me a little sad , but it was realistic . the characters were well done .
and very poorly written , boring and jumping storyline . i really tried hard to find good points , but no ... the & # 34 ; best & # 34 ; part was the first 4 pages ...
really enjoyed this book as i did the earlier books written by grisham . those who have like his earlier books should like this one .
i really enjoyed this book . two simple cowboys trying to live a simple life with complex issues . the sex is pretty steamy but flows naturally with the plot ; always a plus for me .
the jesse stone series written by robert parker is fantastic . good plots and the characters are human like the rest of us .
i really love the king and maxwell stories and hope he will continue to write more of them . they move along great and he has the best story lines . love 'm
i love everything that ken follett writes . once i start reading , i ca n't put them down . this book is especially good .
this book , though about the end of a life , is filled with hope and inspiration . i ca n't recommend it highly enough .
great book , i learned alot . i recommend it highly . opened my eyes . i will never see another movie again the same way .
fantastic read , gripping all the way through . couldnt put it down . love david 's work wish he could write faster so i dont have to wait so long for his books
excellent book . interesting behind the scenes stuff that wo n't get told in the media .
i wish this author has continued to write a ton of books in this series , i could read them over and over !
i loved this book and immediately followed it up with the mini read , flat out matt , to get more on the story . it 's an adorable love story full of emotions and seriously witty dialogue !
this is an easy lovely read . there are no killers , crazy twists , or fantasy characters . just plain , sweet love , and how it sometimes takes you by surprise .
i thoroughly enjoyed reading this . great understanding of history woven into a capturing and engaging tale . well written ... editing needs some help .
after all the dark series i read , this one was nice and a fast read . interesting premise and i really enjoyed it . would recommend it .
this book gave me life ! this is everything a book should be : hear stopping , adventurous and just plain good . i would read this again and again
5 star , i would recommend this book , i love the apple creek series . very well written and the story was great
i purchased these expecting to get more details for the tv series that i really liked - but was disappointed -
i am not done read it , but it is very interesting book . there is several pictures , in 3 sections of book .
not one of my favorites , too typical plot , a lot of sex but not much else . easy read for a boring day .
this book was a good continuation of this series . it was still very interesting and could not put it down .
very well written and very interesting . but also , very sad . i have n't finished it yet because it is so sad . i am reading something funny before i go back and finish it .
from the moment i started this book , i could not put it down . a few twist and turns made me want to get to the end of a very enjoyable book .
felt like i started the book in the middle . basic story is good but characters need to be developed more as there is not background or history .
i can never have enough books and this is an easy fun read . great to sit down and relax and escape . books are the best ever vacation from life . this one is no exception .
these books are very well written and keep you interested . i highly recommend them if you are into vampire novels !
i got the book and i am in the middle of reading it . and i am glad that i bought it it a great book it came fast an on time
this book gives you excellent advice , easy to follow , and enjoyed it thoroughly . will be using this book for a long time .

another treat from heather ! i 'll be reading more from her in the future . now on two the flynn brothers trilogy .
wow ! once i started i could n't put it down caught my attention all the way through first time id read this author and i totally loved it ca n't wait to read the next in the series
holy crap that was such a good book . loved the plot and i think i have a new book boyfriend .
good book but too many twists and turns . i like fast reads without to much thinking , because reading is how i relax .
as my daughter used to say , cheesy ! how did this author ever get published ? ? there are much better authors out there .
disappointed in this robyn carr book . it was slow and not much of the excitement that most of her books have . still love her as an author and will continue to read her books .
i bought this for our office to use as a motivational piece . very easy to listen to and everyone enjoyed it
i enjoyed this book , but felt like i was reading a book for young adults . i did n't find it scary , but i enjoyed reading about the main character . worth the time to read .
do n't like how it is organized and index not user friendly for me to use to find what i want .
i have not read any other books by this author , but am now a fan . i liked it all ... the story , the characters and the locations .
a good read and a real page turner - it had in its grip from beginning to end and it was a great ending
creative and suspenseful ! it was a very quick read and interesting characters and plot . check it out , you wo n't regret it .
wow . i finished book and could not wait to read book 2. i really need book 3 now ! ! ! ! ! ! again 5 stars is not enough for this wonderfully written story .
very good story line . enjoyed all the books . reading for the next book to see what happens to the main characters
enjoyed the story line , using the came main character as an earlier book . kept me all the time with my face in the book .
like to read interesting books . this books looks like i am going to enjoy it
i loved this book but it ends of kinda like a cliff hanger like will they get married have kids i just wan na know more
this was really good not as good as some books but really good ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i would read a third if made it though
this story and characters would make a wonderful action packed movie ! ! i found the characters very real and honest . great story teller !
another fantastic book by kristen ... pretty sure i read it straight through without putting it down . i ca n't wait for leo and sam 's story !
an excellent read by a totally new author for me . i 'll read everything he writes from now on ! keep them coming !
a little on the slow side to start , but once it began to take shape the story was nice , heartwarming and funny . i totally loved it .
i enjoyed this books as i did the other five . i will be curious to see what happens in the next book .
great once again . could n't put it down the first time and have reread it more than once since !
