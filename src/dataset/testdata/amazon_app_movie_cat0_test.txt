do n't buy . filled with bugs , the worst is that there are 2 week tournaments that then do n't pay out the prize . complete rip .
i love this game . the levels get harder and harder . you should get it . i recommend it . the levels are fun .
starts off pretty easy . then builds up . only flaw is if you need to use a cheat , it takes a lot of your earned coins . you have to purchase more .
my husband and i love this game ... .i ca n't get it away from him as he continues each level . excellent graphics , holds your attention and not boring . our favorite game !
i like bingo , but this version is too busy . i like the speed . it 's the graphics and loud music levels that turn me off . it 's a good thing it 's free .

printer share is better if you have a tablet , can print anywhere , but this did not work for me . sorry
its fun but really challenging . pictures are clear but very well hidden . overall i think its a great game . i highly recommend it to everyone who loves hidden object games .
one of the easier guessing games , but fun nonetheless . it could use some instructions , but i was able to figure it out relatively easily .

i t i s t h e b e s t g a m e e v e r y o u n e e d t o g e t i t
as you move through the levels , it gets tougher . but it is fun to see how long it takes to get through it . i still have n't finished 2 of the levels
this game is really fun and i really enjoy the different levels it has and i also like that since there 's an easy medium and hard it makes it more nice to younger kids and older kids
the kids did n't like this app so much . they got bored with it fairly quickly and no longer used it so it was uninstalled .
a great game . it is a strategic game . i have to at least play it to and from work everyday .
i did not know if this was going to work with my kindle fire but it does and i can see what is happening on facebook . the only drawback is that you can not play the facebook games
glad i do n't have to spend money in-game to enjoy it . earning upgrades is the way to go . much better than buying everything .
i like it but do n't love it because it is a little touchy when you go to tilt the kindle to move the ball . but i love the 3d !
very fun game . also a game that you will play all the way through more than once .
while it is fun to play , after a few rounds my kindle fire freezes up and i have to restart it . takes the fun out of it because i know it 's coming .
this is a great time killer . i ordered it for free downloaded in 5 seconds . so far it has been a good game . i recommend this game to anyone .
this is a fun game . in each level you must figure out what to pick up and where to use it .
this is so good i love ot so much and i like the themes . you should get this app.it is the best
i really like this it keeps you mind thinking and your eyes moving all the time great game thank you
this app is very helpful to me , it helps me remember when the last time was , helps me keep track
if you r into the wwe you need this app . keep up to date and be interactive during shows . just fun ! `` feed me more ''
same issue ... fantastic gameplay , and superb game and excellent graphics and free download and then they ask i to pay for better weapons .
this was a much needed item for the kindle . it was a great item to add . downloads quickly and fast .
it 's just like sims . not as good , but still really cool . a lot of my friends have enjoyed this game so i 'm not alone .
well hidden ! most of the time , need the hint . however you can at least see what you are looking for . it 's fun playing .
i wanted to access facebook on my kindle . this does it , and does it well . it 's free , too . good app .
it was fun playing solitaire . got stumped a few times . would like a little more animation . was great playing against my friends .
i love the challenge and its very addictive and fun force you to use your head and to think faster
it is a fun game . so far no issues . i do n't like how i have to post a review or like on facebook to go further in the game .
this game is horrible . when i exited the game it kept playing the music even when i turned my device off crazy annoying . do n't get this game .
my granddaughter downloaded this . she is so into zombies . she loves this game and plays it whenever she 's with me
its alright i just wish there were more options like following and saving the places you like on my kindle fire hd .
finished in a day . my 3 yo niece was able to complete the game with out a problem , needs more of a challange
my daughter loves this app . she enjoys the fact that the picture spins while she puts the color on it .
this is a good game . its entertaining but it can gets boring after a while . it entertains my baby cousin . the key is 2 sell as many fish as possible
my kindle fire started to flash and then the screen turned black then white then came back fuzzy i quickly pressed the home button and got out of it and it almost broke my kindle . do n't get please
i accidentally hit play but was n't done . it needs to check and see if you really want submit your answer before it goes through . also the advertisements get really annoying .
i do not care for a game that you can not play without having to keep spending money just to finish the game !
great game if you like shooting games ... however , i do n't like the cost to purchase slots ( could be a lot cheaper ) . everything else is good .
it is an awesome game to play to i really love to play it because i think real hard to play it
love this game . so far very good graphics and music is ok. if u like puzzle type games . give this one a try .
a must download ! a real time killer . if you never played this , you will become addictive . you can easily pass & play to friends around a table or in the car on road trips .
this is a fun way to pass the time . no real mind skill but a good way to keep the reflexes sharp .
like that i can color code my notes . date is easy to find as well for each note . overall very useful .
this is a fun app that you can use when you 're bored . i do n't know why people are complaining about inappropriate ads , because i do n't see any . i highly recommend this app .
i think this is a great app ! i still like wedding salon better though . i bought the full version of both and it is worth your money ! i think it is great for all ages .
do not use it much but it is fun to play . like to bowl and do n't get out much . i work 40 hours .
fun game . wish you could upgrade the weapons quicker . just started to get ads in between levels . not too bad
i love this game it reminds me of the times i used to horse back ride keeps me busy when there is n't much to do love the graphics
it 's basically scrabble . it 's fun though . there 's not much more to say . i have no more to add but i have to because the thing says i need more words .
i love bingo ! ... i would playing that all day with it and keep up the good work on this awesome bingo go go kindle yeah !
absolutely cute and fun to play . it could have a little more animation with the characters , but super cute as it is and addicting to play .
i can finally watch the current seasons of my favorite tv shows instead of having to wait until the season is over and hopefully watch it on netflix !
this was downloaded for my husband who occasionally likes to play it . he apparently likes it because he plays it a lot .
i deleted this it was not fun and not very interesting . i would not suggest it for kids to play either
this is a good app , it works as intended and is not at all disappointing . i would recommend it to anyone .
i have n't played this one as much as some of my others , but it is very much like the casino slot game .
very addictive and lots of fun . great that there is a little story to go along with it . lots of fun to play against family and friends . so glad i can have it on kindle now .
found it difficult to use . i have other & # 34 ; in a row & # 34 ; games i liked better . i play candy crush and bubble combo
i enjoy playing this game on my down time . it can be challenging to figure out , yet fun to do .
a good game using strategy and luck . very addictive when planning where to place the coins . cute graphics and prizes .
i thought this was going to be easy but you really need to think your moves at least 3 to 4 in advance . this is a great mind game .
love this game ! i play these games and so far this is the best one i 've found . best of all , i do n't have to wait for moves .
you should all get this incredible game ! i have all the salon games and they are my favorite ! best game ever ! ! !
it lets u tap on it way easy , since the real one makes it less easy when u use ur feet .
this is fun game and i would recommend it to everyone who like a word games and who likes challenges
love this game i like the building and fixing things and how you can go fishing and shot bad guys and collect money
i just got introduced to this game by my friend and it rocks . i think you should think about getting it .
don ` t like the facebook part to collect some of the winnings . but like graphics and kills time when don ` t need to think .
i enjoy puzzle games , and this is a good one . i have not had any of the problems other reviewers have mentioned . the game lives up to its press .
i like checking the weather in my area when i have not had the time to check out the news , i have this on my kindle and it works well enough for a quick check .
i like to play spider it is fun and i really enjoy it . everyone should try it and see how fun it is .
invite some people over , make some drinks and go for it.. some are easy , some hard , but the game is a lot of fun
very entertaining . hooked after the first round . looks easier than it is but still mindless enough to play while hanging out waiting in long holiday lines .
only downloaded this for the minute it took me to open it then i closed it and took it off my device .
this is one of the best match 3 games i have found so far . even if you ca n't make it through all the matches its still fun to keep trying . makes time fly by .
love this app n all this fashion . designs are great . selections are fun and backgrounds too . can spends hours on this app .
great app for saving money . i have used gas buddy for years when traveling now can get a quick update before going to the local station .
layout a little different but from what i 've seen it 's youtube . a a a a a a a a a
this is a fun game ! play this game for loads of fun ! i love th gems instead of coins to buy stuff in this game .
entertaining hidden object game . played it during a cross country flight and the time seemed to fly by . i would recommend it .
this game is as fun as it looks . i never write reviews but `` this game is worth it ! '' i read in another review .
i this is a very fun and very challenging game . good for older children and adults . definitely worth the try .
tiny bird is fun to play with friends and family because there is no connecting to facebook ! i had lots of fun with this game .
i have truly enjoyed playing this game . i love word games anyway so it is a great way to challenge you to think .
all you can do is keep tapping on a page and see if something happens . no directions what so ever . uninstalled .
this game seemed fun at first , but then would not run smoothly . after several interruptions over several days , i removed it !
i am still trying out the free version before purchasing the other version . the card game seems to be more entertaining .
the visuals in this game are gorgeous . whoever did the design did a wonderful job i looked forward to each new scene . the game play was good . could be a little harder .
the game is great , smooth graphics , wish there was n't so much player vs player . some people just do n't want to deal with other players so often . maybe a leave me alone option ...
fun but needs more shake up options . other similar coin games have a shake up bar so you can get more coins and prizes .
it took me a few minutes to get the hang of it . it is fun to feed the dragons and watch them grow .
love it fun and entertaining to the brain uses a lot of strategy have to really use your head if you were back in the day although i 'm not from back in the day
very great battery reminder . allows you to know when you are about to run out of battery life . recommend to others .
this is a great game . it runs great on my fire and is very fast paced . easy to learn , i 'm sure my 9 year old daughter will enjoy it too .
this app is the best in world get it ! very good app ! i love it very fun games for kids !
i 'm glad they updated this app to include a single player board . i like to use it while i wait for words with . friends .
i loved playing this game on the computer nice it 's so much easier on my kindle fire . love it , it 's bigger blocks so i can see the board better .
this is a super fun game , another great free game from amazon . keeps you on your toes , love it ... thanks again so much ...
the app works good . it is fast and plays whatever you are doing . you should get this app its worth it b
i love this game , it is hilarious to play . i ca n't draw worth a darn , but i somehow am doing well with draw something ! ! ! !
i enjoyed watching these old movies and television shows . i wish we could listen the old time radio shows on streaming rather than downloading . all in all a pretty good app .
i sometimes ca n't get the words to come about in my brain . i will keep on trying to come up with the right words
great app , it is nice that verses come up every day . it is nice to be reminded of what god does for us
i love this app . it is so much fun , especially when you get other people involved . i love , love it .
i like it . could be a little harder though . i get through the levels quite fast . be good for older kids .
i was expecting more , i was n't overly impressed with this port . i got it when it was the free app of the day , and uninstalled it that day
i really enjoy this game and the way it works - very entertaining and love the cat addition i bought
its an awesome app . this app will help you prepare your self before you head into a casino . big help ! ! ! !
this is a great challenge if you like bejeweled you may like this game . at the top you are required to complete the number of the color to go to the next level .
this game was a pretty good game . of course i love these kinds of games and can play them for hours but still i think any body could like this game
the game starts out real easy but after a while it becomes more challenging and that 's what i like , a challenging game .
this game you cant put the girls hair so i deleted it and you mostly have to unlock everything also you cut all of her hair
this app was just not what i thought it was . i was looking for an app to help track my budget and spending .
this game is lots fun and lots of bonus games ! good payouts and does not take long to get to next levels ! highly recommend this one ! h
this game is challenging and entertaining but difficult ... but if it was n't it wouldnt be interesting . i wish it had more hints though for free .
the greatest game ever it 's definitely worth the money but warning its addicting i would give it a million stars if i could it 's a great game for all ages have fun if u get it
great classic game to play , wife and daughter play 's this alot and love 's word search fun , great choice to buy .
this is a great game to teach you how to spell and find words at the same time . anyone can play this .
this is an okay game , but has too few puzzles , and is not very responsive . there should be three times the puzzles . it 's fun while it lasts .
i originally got this game for my phone from google and was very happy to find it here for my kindle fire . very cute game !
this has got to be the best game on the kindle fire that i have ever played . i 'm addicted . totally with the buck ! !
the camera on the kindle fire hd is nothing to write home about , so this app does the best it can with what little it has to work with .
it seems good ; however kindle fire does not have the software to make it work . i did not even received it in the device
i really enjoy playing mahjong so i downloaded this game and i really like it . smooth game play and nice graphics .
it was a good game to start with . but then you have to buy the full version . did not want to play that much to play rest of it .
my granddaughters got bored with this game quickly . must be an age thing ?
i love this app i use it all the time ! it 's really fun but i wish it could have special effects that 's what it needs but other than that i think it 's good : )
love this game . i sit down after work and play it over and over to unwind . it keeps my mind moving and is fast paced . try it out .
love it ! i play it as a single solo player and it is a great way to keep an `` old '' mind active .
i really dislike the ads on the bottom of the screen , very annoying and it messed up a couple of my games , other then that i love the app and also download it for my new phone !
first of all i got this on my kindle and for some reason it deleted everything i ever built . this should be fixed
very good . i reccomend this cuz it is fun however like any game it gets old . but overall it is good
i love that this game is very very very very very very very very very very very very very very cool .
fun . gives a story while you advance with the game . pictures were clear and fun . gives hours of fun . not to difficult .
i so cool its really fun an it just gives me some thing to do and the best part is its free !
i love the holy bible on my kindle . so easy to use and come very useful . when looking up scriptures
highly recommend . easy to set up and play . i 've become addicted to bingo and this one is at the top of my list
saw that it was a limited offer , so deleted it . i do n't think this camera would be what i needed .
if you like word search games this is fun . the game is free and the puzzle are always different . enjoyable game that will keep you busy for hours .
this is a fun easy game , my son really likes it , this is not violent so it is a good game
easy to understand and fun to play . still a learning curve because this is not you normal match 3 game .
yes i have played the original release of this game on pc but really enjoy it on my kindle fire .
i keep all my notes on it during meetings and just reminders for me for daily things . can 't do with out it . no need for paper and pencil with this app .
this game is kinda hard because when you are tapping one of the little squares to clear it , you have to hit it twice , so you might hit another square and clear that one .
this app is dumb it wo n't let me play do n't and i mean do not get it . it looks like fun but it is not .
my daughter has this on her kindle fire and she likes it ok but she does n't play it very much .
this is the type of game you spend hours and hours trying to finish it.it makes you think everytime you finish each level .
love sharing videos from youtube . this is the perfect app to do so . never had a problem with it and the sound is great .
i think i will like this only had it for a little bit . i will up date when i have had it longer .
just got it , lots of fun . have n't really got the hang of it yet but enjoying getting to know it . match three + is fast becoming a favorite .
the is great it is my 5 favorite game . another reason y i like it is because the animals are so so cute
it will be nice to get local news when we are on vacation . so far , i really like it . great !
very interesting free game . it is very addicting . those are logos we see almost everyday . some are never heard of . we have to search nonlinear and learn even more .
if you love listening to music you will really enjoy this app . i can not spend a day without playing at least one of my stations . you decide what you want to listen to .
fun , with great graphics . it 's by far the best horse game amazon has . i like how they give you gems for free as a gift .
it is an alright app but gets really boring after a while . they need to put a new photo on it each day instead of keeping all of these same photos .
some of the graphics took a while to load but this was still a fun adventure to play . creative ! will play more games from g5 .
this is a very fun game . it is easy and yet challenging all at the same time . it is fun to try to guess it with just the first picture . some you can and others not .
would love to have the lyrics board for the tablet , but no go from what i found . i do n't like this one at all . too complicated to use
would be better if we did n't have to pay for tokens or earned them faster . been playing on kindle fire and runs smoothly no problems as of yet .
this game is awesome . i have a hard time putting it down . its so addicting but so much fun . love it
one of the best free apps of the day ever ! had i known how good it was i would have paid for it . great game .
i have this and 1 other app for files on my kindle fire . they both work great . explore your kindle fire just like you would your computer with windows explorer .
love facebook have it on my computer , love that i can talk to cousins and friends that live far away
addictive ! it took me a minute to catch on , but now i ca n't put it down ! ! ! it 's a must have ! definitely worth buying !
can not play on droid . would love to play , bit does not go past the first level splash screen . reinstalled and had the same problem .
what a great way to learn and laugh at some great quotes while solving some very clever puzzles . highly recommended . note to developers : please make frequent updates . i must have more !
this is a fun game that will keep you entertained for hours . the graphics are good and the clues are sometimes challenging . i will be trying all of the quest games .
my son comes every day and say grandma when my home work you think i can have a little bird time .
i down loaded this by mistake . i tried the game and it worked well however it is not one of my favorites . i would rather play hearts and other card games available .
i love this app it 's easy to use and very handy . this is my new favorite app and will be using it daily .
great game . works good on my kindle 2nd generation . only thing is it needs an instruction guide . i had to ask my grandson how things worked .
i like this fun game ! it is great to pass the time when i can not get wifi . i play it in the car on long trips .
i feel very stupid in the game because i get the right word but i do n't know how to enter the word but it is fun to draw it but you have to buy it it is n't free
have n't got my first phone yet but this app is just as useful . u can text people who have phones or u can text people with the app . i highly suggest this app .
this game is a lot of fun . its a good way to pass time . the graphics and pictures are great . i would definately recommend this game !
started out working , but today it shows up blank . shame as it was a great app . it was a great idea , until it stopped .
worst bingo game ever . bingo blitz is the best bingo game worth downloading . all the others including this one are boring and a waste of time .
i have always loved hidden object games ! this one is pretty cool ! it took awhile to download but was n't disappointed . i could spend hours doing these !
do n't waste your time not fun there are better hidden objects out there that are way more fun i am sorry that i wasted my time on this
this app is really amazing . it lets me do things with my own horse . i really like that , also i 've always wanted a horse so this is as close as i 'll get to one .
this is basic match 3 game but the way the give goals makes it fun to go back again and try to gain 3 stars for each game .
fast moving game that keeps you thinking all the time . would recommend to all ages . helps with eye hand coordination .
this is a nicely done application . in timed mode being able to get all the possible solutions for the 5 character version is hard , but it is impossible when playing with 7 characters .
i like the game very much . it is addictive and mind boggling . it makes you think inside and outside the box .
started out good . some good game play . small glitches that i hope they fix quickly . overall a good game with good potential .
this is a great game . i enjoy playing this game . my children also enjoy playing this game . this is a game that challenges your mind . simply for that i give it four stars .
i love yahtzee , and this is it ! i also love that fact that you can play others live . if you like yahtzee , you will love this !
i do not recommend this app . it was not fun at all , and it seemed to be very , very slow .
really fun like a small journey ... . you can create your on stick person and go on your way to find a friend ... . : )
have n't played this one as much as some of the other games . maybe when i get the hang of it i will enjoy it more .
this one presents enough of a challenge to keep it interesting . just when you think the phrases are easy , you get some that are more challenging .
this app gives you a lot of stuff that people would like to buy and some of them ca n't but gives you lower prices than they usually are .
it is an ok app but you cant race anyone you just build cars if you like building cars get this app but if you only like racing then do n't buy it
good app to kill time : - ) i would highly recommend this app and i play everyday on my lunch break . i got a lot of people playing along
it seems like a decent enough game but slow at first and i am not too fond of having to spend real money for little reward
really fun game , have the paid version on my android phone and am planning on getting it for the kindle too .
okay i guess , not quite like the iphone version and some pics are rather confusing and some do n't really relate
i was just on this today and it now sucks . it wo n't let me download videos now and it makes me upset because this was amazing until that happened ...
this game is really cool . love the story . the graphics are cool . puzzles get progressively harder . you should get this great game ! enjoy !
saw the other reviews about not working on the fire i also had problems picking up items at first but worked fine after a few minutes . it did take a little longer to install .
there are only so many options that are free . the game is wonderful for learning and keeping kids interested , but after a while , they 've mastered what is free .
did not blow me away , but it was ok. like the option of choosing different games , but hate to ask friends for chips
just a good basic news app . easy to use , stories are listed well . a good quick go to for the top stories .
i download this game for my son we thought it would be fun based on the graphics but he doesnt like it .
my son played this out quickly . it 's cute , but there 's not much to it . he is 2 1/2 and he completed all of the puzzles very quickly .
love this game . it gets harder each level . . . i still have a couple that i cant seem to pass . i just wish there were more .
its super cute and super fun if you dont like then is something wrong because its awesome and i really love it
get this game . it will get people having fun all around the world ! if you are wondering if i love it . you are correct ! thank you amazon
fun but some design flaws to make you spend those gold coins by mistake . i had no restart issues but my husband 's game crashed and he had to restart it
my kids love this game . me of course keeps running into things . all in all its a pretty good game ! ! !
easier to riddle through than 100 floors . better clues and more fun . like searching the rooms and putting the hints and tools together .
it is an amazing game . ca n't get enough of it ! ! ! the creator of this game should make more like this .
it was an ok game for the time it took me to play . good for an afternoon to waste time .
fun game to play ! ! ! reminds me of sim city . will enjoy for a long time . i would recommend to my friends .
i love this game . its awesome . its so fun . its amazing ! ! you should get it . its like you are really in a tournament . you should really get it .
cool game download its like plants vs zombies and it has a twist to the game it is so so so so so so so so so so so so so fun
i got this by mistake . i do n't really understand it and have n't tried it . i 'll have to study it a bit more .
as far as hidden games go its pretty good not the best one ive ever played but not the worse either i 'm glad it was free for the day it was worth the download .
this game is awesome . but it 's stupid you have to redo some of the missions even though you have already completed them .
game runs very slow on my galaxy s phone , does n't look like there are too many levels . even if it ran ok , i would n't buy it , certainly not for $ 4
this game is a ripoff of pokemon but a good one at that so if you love pokemon get this game
like this game so far . and very easy to play . my children who are special needs can play the game very easily
this game is so awesome ! it is really easy to reach goals but half of them give you a do able challenge !
the sounds are just okay . it would be nice if you could see them all at once then choose the ones you want .
i love this game . some days i just go on and on , others i ca n't seem to build enough words . but it is definitely a great game !
this game was the most challenging game ive ever played , it was fun and i recommend it for all ages . the best game ever
got ta love this game . it 's awesome . i love the sound effects and how it 's interactive . great for kids to play .
it is so awesome ! it 's addicting . i do n't have to buy another app for a long time . and this one is free !
it wants my info ? no way ! ! ! i made a submit that wants my info was a bad choice for those people who agree with me .
i do n't know how to explain this except awesome ! the graphics are amazing and the fish are just like real life and the game itself is almost as good as minecraft !
the food that i need daily in my life . we all need this app to get us through our lives .
this game is so much more than playing . this game is a great memory aid for mentally challenged people . it 's also wonderful for early readers . i highly recommend this game .
i like this game . it is fun and exciting and really challenges you . it is very hard as well . i like it .
i am very addicted to this game ! love the colors and how easy it is to play it . totally recommended .
this game is the best and if you do n't like it this game is not for you but this game is the best
this is my favorite game ... i play with my mom or my family when i ca n't play an actual game with them
this is a cute . and interesting . little . game . that my little girl just love it keeps her entertained . just watching it .
could n't figure out how to play this game . there are n't any directions that i could find with the game . i deleted it .
the response time on play is excellent . i like the scoring system . i recommend this version to friends . i play often .
this app can be hours of addictive fun . it is so simple & amp ; yet i just ca n't seem to put it down .
i gave this a four star rating as i enjoy playing the game but wish you could earn some things instead of having to purchase them .
it was dumb and not entertaining at all . i play games to wind down after a busy day at work and this was boring .
to be honest , i thought this was n't bad at all . turns out , i was wrong . the graphics are bad , and the fact that it has in-app purchasing . do not get this app .
the stupid app would not load at all i am very very very very mad at tiny co i will never get a tiny co app again .
love this app ! ! ! simple , addicting , awesome ! ! ! i could just sit and play this game over and over again ! ! no suggestions for the developers , great job guys ! !
such a simple idea but a great fun game to play with friends and family . still a novice but learning and loving it !
this app is so awesome and it lets you do anything and it is the most funniest app i 've ever played ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! : )
always a game that relax my mind while playing cards good eye contact too i just love it and look for to winning alot
i do n't have this app but my friend does and i played it once on her kindle fire and it was sooooo much fun ! ! so i really think it deserves 5 stars .
i did n't realize how many different moving vehicles are really out there . so much fun to figure them out . i did n't know i knew a lot about them

i play it with my sister . this is a really fun game . u should get it . i love it so much .
i like knowing the weather so thanks but this twenty or more word thing is a bit too much ... i 'll be honest with the stars
its a challenge but its fun . and if you have trouble just find cheats on youtube . its really a good game !
pretty fun game only thing is you seem to lose more than you win and takes too long to get to a decent daily bonus . fun but glad i did n't have to pay for it .
its a good game and i like it but i think its a little over priced . i should have gotten the ad-free version for 0.99 .
ice age is very fun and fun to create my dogs love watching the animals . everyone will enjoy young and old
this game was just plain boring . i thought i would like it but there was no true challenge to it .
this is another one of my addictive game . once i start it , it 's hard to put it down . i love it .
this is perfect its never slow running and this is an app that you always want to come back to because there 's something new everyday
this game is great for challenging the mind as well as allowing a person to sharpen their puzzle working skills .
i do enjoy a good bingo game . this one keeps me well entertained ... for good periods of time . thanks gamers . keep up the good work .
i really like this game a lot , but sometimes only 4 dice show up ! i still like it , though , and it was worth the 99 cents i paid for it .
this is nice to watch when you ca n't watch tv , my daughter wanted to watch a movie , but i had to go to bed so she downloaded it on her ipad and went in her room .
this is a very cute game i put it on my kindle fire for my grandkids but iv been playing g it more than them . i love it .
love to play this - it gets more challenging as you go along . i can see this being a fun game for all ages .
my 5 year old son loves this game ... it is a great tool to get little kids interested in math . he can play this game anytime he wants too .
does exactly what it claims . its a slightly new twist on an old game . easy to learn with lots of levels from very easy to very hard . works great on my kindle fire . thanks
this is like temple run , but a lot more fun . i recommended this to 10 friends . best app ever , ever .
this was a good first game of a good game series . in fact i give it a ten out of ten .
i was looking for an easy to use simple calculator and this is it . nice big buttons and easy to read .
i have enjoyed each round of golf ; especially the use of multiple strategies to get the highest score . thanks big fish for a challenging game .
works even better on my kindle than my i phone . : ) love it ! highly recommended to anyone who has a netflix account . : )
dumb game , hard to play and not easy to figure out . would n't get this one again if i had a choice .
great app if you dont wan na give someone your cell number , or if your having cell phone problems , this app helps a load .
a cute app for some small children . my daughter played it for 5 minutes but it does n't have enough to make it more fun .
it 's a pretty fun game . definitely has tested my ability of to be more focused and not rush through things .
the kids are always on this one ! if we get a new device they put it back on . they are 8 & 9 and love it
oh it is so so so so so so so so so fun buy it it is awesome ! fashion is the key ! i love love it
it 's a great gun sim but it needs more guns . buy it and wait a couple months and it will have a lot of guns .
this is the first hangman game that i downloaded that i have liked well enough to keep on my kindle . every other one i was disappointed in .
awesome app ... does what it 's supposed to do . runs fast and smooth on my droid 2. graphics are decent and the selection of games is superb .
what can you say its an app for facebook , it works for what i need it and does whats needed ,
i think that bubble ball is an awsome game because you get to see a little bubble roll so cool
this is a fun and entertaining game that i spend many hours a week playing . i have fun competing with my kids .
i really enjoy this game . it 's fun to play it with my friends on facebook . it works great on my kindle fire
i enjoy playing this game . it looks easier than it actual is . when i get down to the hidden object i use the hint button
i like the graphics for the slots on these games . also , like the video poker aspect - like playing poker , but never do well when i play ; so am practicing with this game .
this game totally beats flappy bird i love it if you like flappy bird you will like this game very very very addicting though so be careful love this game it rocks must download
this game is fun and very addictive . i find i best to save up your diamonds and spend them , only if you need to .
this app do n't show you how to do it it just show you the picture like you can read what it is saying . horrible
i like this game . it is fun though frustrating at times . it can take many tries to complete some of the levels .
my 8 year old is very disappointed . we can not get beyond the start page . do n't waste your time or money !
this app is not only fun but it also has a few educational games on it . plus , it does n't constantly want your $ $ .
another game , which i do more often than others , this takes more concentration than most games , and gives me more challenges .
stupid game ! gives no directions & amp ; not fun at all what a waste of time ! ! ! if you think this is awesome you really are way too easy to please .
it 's solitaire , so there is n't much to mess up . always a fan of the game and this version is great . and you ca n't beat the price ... free ! highly recommend .
always liked this game growing up . well played on the tablet . great addition to my game collection in my apps .
this is really fun . i like that you can personalize almost everything . i also really like that they did a bunch of the games like other popular games .
this game has a lot of action that 's very easy to get addicting to . it also does n't really require you paying in app purchases like most free games make you do .
it 's solitaire - how bad can someone screw that up . it works well , i enjoy playing alone because i do n't play well with others .
played a lot and crazy about it . every body is playing and it too much now and stop it now .
i 'd like this crossword app a lot better if it did n't keep constantly asking me to review it after every completed puzzle .
it would be decent to have more game modes and maps but this game as nice gameplay good graphics and lots of guns to kill with !
this is a great game fun for all ages . come join the fun . i love to come home from work and go straight to the game .
favorite bingo game . only complaint ... bingo chips go so quickly so not a lot of play time . otherwise ... . this is the best .
i can not wait until my grandson gets his kindle with this app . i played this and it was soooo much fun . i wonder if he will let me use his kindle to play this game ?
i love this game . i actually bought it for my grandson but i play it more than he does . it 's challenge to get 3 stars sometimes but i keep trying .
there are a few episodes available if you do not have a cable provider but you get more if you do .
when i click start i cant play it just shows the title it happens every time i try to play it i do n't even know what this game is like
this is a pretty fun game . it really gets your mind working sometimes . hope they update with more levels soon .
my grandson down loaded this one on my kindle fire and he seems to like it i dont play it but he likes it .
its super awesome . do n't listen to any of the haters . works perfectly on my kindle fire . i 'm really glad its free .
i love crosswords and there are much better free apps available out there instead of buying this one , no matter how cheap .
the game is ok , got old for me pretty quick , but is a fun concept . if the price is right i recommend it .
ok app if you like looking for one type of object per screen . i prefer to look for a variety of objects instead of one .
good game fairly addictive great time waster would recommend to anyone . my kids also love it . was easy for them to figure out the controls .
practice and more practice in an easy to handle application . i 've already spent some hours practicing the quizzes and by doing so , i will be ready for the test .
i have this on my phone also . gives me accurate radar . and the alerts are great . i would recommend this app .
this game is kind of fun . if you want a free , laid back card game to pass the time by , you should consider getting it
my kindle would not allow this to be installed . could be a user error because it works great on my cell phone .
the game rocks , i love it . it is really kinda violent but when you get better weapons you kinda feel awesome .
after awhile it becomes very boring . then you just want to delete it i do n't think you should download it
it does what i need it to do . it helped with my phone and i just downloaded it for my kindle but i have n't had a chance to use it yet .
it was fine . i like the app . i just have too many angry birds apps on my kindle . i would not have removed it otherwise .
it is n't for everyone , but it is good for an older person , like me , to keep the mind busy doing different things . i like to play this game during commercials of my favorite shows .
like it because you can watch movies that are not on netflix and even some that are . biggest downfall is that there are still commercials
the game is fun but i think it should give the option to start where you stopped from the previous time and not just at the beginning everytime you go on . maybe i missed something in the instructions .
love this game i have it on my computer but i downloaded and wo n't . work on kindle fire please fix then i could give it the highest rating
this game is soooo much fun . its not to hard but not to easy ... i play it a lot and it loads great : ) no lag ... get now
not really anything special , it gets old quick and then you do n't use it again until you go to clean up your phone .
it 's cute , that is about all , idk what else to say but if you want to try it be my guest yea
i have several of these apps from many tv stations on my smartphone . this is the best of them all ...
i only have 1 problem it is impossible to land . but if you look at everything else it 's nice in a whole
the levels progress and a good rate . it was just easy enough and just challenging enough to keep us going .
love it just fun and also challenging to see how far you can get ,
temple run is a lot of fun once u play its addicting it great for people who love skill games
i like it very much . it is very addicting . i just wish more people would play it . keep coming up with more games !
i love ( ! ! ! ) the game it 's great but for a month it would n't let me play it otherwise i love it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
it 's interesting to play but after a few minutes , you get bored with it . still , if you want something to play , get this .
it 's ok , again , great for waiting room time , or when you have nothing else to do . like the others , there is more than one level , and they get harder as you progress .
this app is pretty good ! it keeps me entertained for a while . i like that there r so many levels ! ! ! !
this game is soon bad it is boring and not fun ! i thought it would be way more fun ! i dont recommend this game for anyone ! ! ! : ( : (
game is fun . it does get a bit redundant though . the biggest challenge is the touch sensitivity as you have to press for a while to get it to register .
i was able to print what i needed to from my kindle . the first app i downloaded did not work .
very challenging . however , with my 7 '' kindle fire , the picture is so small it 's difficult to find some of the objects .
cute characters . fun game . does require real money for some thing 's . good way to waste time . and its free so you cant beat that .
great slot game . would have given five stars but it took forever to download to my kindle . other than that no issues or problems to speak of .
it 's a cute and fun game . i can leave it for a day and come back to lots of activity .
this app sucks , if you buy it on a kindle fire . it ca n't locate a lost phone . do not buy it !
this is quick and informative . my favorite items when looking for a game to play . and it is free too . best combination .
wow ! is just about all i can say about this app . i can shop all day from anywhere and how cool is that !
wished they had a free lite game of this free so could try it first as well as see how it works with the different devices . i wished they make a free one available soon .
love this game it is a good way to pass the time you wont be sorry a good app i would highly reccomend
it makes me feel like i 'm at a casino yet i do n't leave my house and i do n't spend alot of money because i do buy coins when needed .
love the game on kindle hd . was a very smart purchase . should have got it the first day ! ! ! play it everyday ! !
i love this game it is so cool to play if i could well i can but i would stay up all night playing it
this app is pretty cool . i ca n't figure out a lot of these movies but i still play it lol . i definitely recommend it to everyone .
cute but i found them a tad hard to control . although i never am very good at driving or flying games so would probably be better game for someone who really likes them .
i love this game but its not my favorite game and it gets stuck when its loading like on for me it gets stuck for me it gets stuck on 21 and 18 .
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 minutes to download
this is a great game i really like it : ) its awesome if u like words with friends or hanging
i do n't know why everyone is complaining . it is a great game . first you choose your own team and progress through seasons . i recommend it to everyone
this game has added upgrades since i first started to play . now i ca n't go a day without playing because i get a gold coin daily just for logging on . lots of fun .
i had the free version & rarely used it . when amazon offered the pay version for free , i downloaded it & it is now my weather app of choice . much easier to use
really like the graphics . wish we had a little more time to search . i like the way the items we search for are hidden in the pictures . makes it harder to find them
i really enjoy playing this slot game . it is quite addictive and lots of fun . you never know which bonus game you are getting which adds to the fun .
it is fun but it lt reset my account so i uninstalled it . how does it delete my account ! ? that 's really stupid
completely addictive . i have been playing for hours and did n't even realize that i was . i would definitely recommend this for anyone .
it is lots of fun . great for killing time . love that there are different games to chose from . fun for everyone .
i love this app . i play it quite a bit . a recent update caused it to crash but the support i got by e-mail talked me through fixing that .
great app for kids kindle access , free makes it even better . gives my daughter lots of options of drawing and coloring .
i love these kinds of puzzles especially the flippix ones . you cant complain about free . i definitely would recommend this app .
i love i find it fun and some challenging levels some easy u will love it to real cool and it is totally worth everything ! ! ! ! ! : - )
its hard to control but if they made it easier it would be fun , but they made the controls hard . and well its not fun .
this game is so much fun . love the sound effects . the birds are super cute . i can sit and play this forever .
candy crush is a great game ! when i first found out about it i did n't know why people were so addicted to it then i started playing it and i am totally addicted ! ! !

i play this game all the time . the game works flawlessly and is very interesting . i would highly recommend this to anyone who has a phone
what a game . love the challenge and the different levels and vehicles . hooked on the game , do it while watching tv
this is my overall favorite game for the kindle fire hd . great with a big screen . great with a small screen
this game was very entertaining , and oh so very addictive . many of the logos were very difficult but it became a challenge to research the answer . definitely a winner .
i have tried to contact someone to help me get the game open but have not been able to . i can rate the game because i have not played it .
i like the format of this game , and my kid seems to enjoy it as well . we particularly like the characters .
i have always loved logic puzzles and was more than happy to find them for my kindle . love it
boring and i do not like it . might be good game for a 4 yeah old . sorry but needs to be more entertaining
the best game ever for the kindle fire . wow i ca n't believe its finally available for the kindle fire . so addictive and fun . i absolutely love it ! ! ! ! ! !

it is pretty fun . i enjoy it and think it is fun . it is not the same as the original but i enjoy it anyways
this game is great for long car trips . my kids love it . to be honest , i play it to ! great game
this game is really addictive , as well as a great time killer . great sound , wonderful graphics , and no glitches with my kindle fire . truly impressed .
the only reason i downloaded the application in the first place is because it was the free app of the day and i was curious as what it had to do or could do
this game is so addicting and is a game that will make you think plus it gives you a challenge .
this is by far the best game . makes me glad i have the fire . even though i bought it mainly to read . i 'm hooked .
it 's a little glitchy , not the best app ever . not the best quality . however it did help me , and i give it 3 stars .
like this game . i usually ca n't remember names of movies but enjoy this game anyway . most of the time i just guess
the questions are either pretty easy or repeated too much . i have been challenged a bit but not playing too much any more .
i played this all the way through years ago in pc and loved it ... the controls are bad and it froze repeatedly . i deleted it .
wow its one of the best games ever love it and restaurant story and fashion story . great game lots of fun
fun game for anyone to play . my niece & amp ; nephew will steal my kindle once they play it the first time .
i really like this . hope i can go farther on this one than version 1 ! fun for the whole family .
good app but not on the top maybe you guys should try harder next time and seriously how many questions do you guys want to get people to get all the questions
i just did n't care for the looks of the tiles . they were hard to see and just too small . i like the game though .
you watch the baby dance . it is cute cause it moves to many different sounds or music . you like cute . this is for you .
hidden objects quest is a lot of fun . i have this on my kindle fire and when i have a few minutes down i play for a few minutes which goes into an hour .
this is as habit forming as finding words in a crossword puzzle . you are given choices of playing under different conditions . really enjoy ! !
i got this game for my granddaughter that i was visiting . she loved it ! perfect for a little girl .
this is a fun bingo game with cute graphics . easy to play and easy to continue playing without paying which works for me !
this took to long to load . i did n't like the fact that u cant get a good shot because it moved hard to control the aim
my granddaughter and i really like this game . it helps her spelling also . it gives us lots of quality time together .
really fun and u can buy ur favorite dog or any animals ... .if u love games u have to check a lot u will luv this because i luv it
i like all flip pix pictures but the objects in this one were rather boring in comparison to the others i have done
this was a really fun game . the bad part is that it does not save the level u r on . : ( but . still try it out . its really fun .
this is a really good app . it will show you where day and night is at in real time . no matter where you are . this is one of the few apps i keep using .
it 's just a basic notepad , no more no less . perfect for just creating a quick note or a list . i love it !
temple run two is a great twist on the original game with new characters , money , goals , and i love the mine portion of the game .
my daughter loves this app . you get to put makeup on princess . also when you are done with the makeup you can add the pictures to your kindle fire hd
i love this game , can be very addicting . sometimes it is hard to stop playing the game . will recommend this game to others
this is the best game next to flappy bird ( before it was taken off the appstore ) its fun , easy , and awesome ! ! : d
what a fun bingo game ! great app ! thanks for being a free download ! recommend to anyone who loves to play bingo !
love this app , and the social interaction with other stores is pretty spectacular . i just hope the clothes are worth a day of wait ! ! !
we play as a family and challenge one another who can get the most coins in one run . we always have fun with this game .
its just a little book were you touch things and they move . unless your five or under you wont like this app
good game , just like yahtzee , but how do you set it so there are more than 2 players ? i 'd like to play this with my entire family .
to be fair , i did not use this much . you need a constant internet to enjoy this app . if you have internet on everywhere you go im sure this app . is ok to enjoy .
we could n't get this to work on our kindle fire . it would look like it was talking , but it did n't make any sound .
this is an entertaining because you get to maintain your own horse it is very extremely fun to help your horse
this is cool . you have lots of options and i see my 3 year old getting better at her letters and sounds .
great game . fun game . awesome game . do n't like how quick your energy runs out . zombie games are always a good thing . make more .
game is good to play , especially if you have more than one playing . need cheaper hints or better scoring . try it ... .
totally cute and fun matching game . i 'm addicted and telling everyone i know they should play , too , because it 's so much fun !
for a free app it 's great my kids downloaded the app as they know i like hidden object games this was a good choice .
awesome game . one time when i went to play , after playing another game all my progress was gone . other than that , this game is the best game rovio has come up with so far
incredibly fun and addicted game that is great for any age . the recent updates have added a lot of content as well .
it was n't what i expected . it was a maze that you had to get the character through , and i found it tedious and totally boring . just not my kind of game .
it is so fun i like games that you serve burger 's . i love this . game it is fun fun fun
thus game is so fun trying to figure out how to open the doors it 's so amazing i. could play it all day ! ! !
fun but instructions are not to clear on how to move up levels . wish you could make money faster and things were cheaper
this app is great for keeping your grandchildren entertained for short periods of time , especially when they are 2 years old .
what is free is about 5 minutes of game time and then they start asking for money to upgrade , excuse me but free to me means the ( whole ) game is free .
great fun and challenging at times . some of the puzzles are kind of dumb , some are long and get hidden behind the keyboard . but all in all , a fun app to have on my kindle .
so i played it and all the people started fighting me for no reason ! and your energy go 's down super fast
this is a fun and challenging game . easy to play , but not always so easy to win ; which is what keeps me coming back to it again and again .
i really liked it . although the ads are solo annoying , this turned out to be a great game . do n't make bad reviews ! ! !
this game is so good i like it so much it is the best game i ever played i love it so much
it 's a mission so that 's the only reason why i 'm doing this . if you get this game try it before you make up your mind .
good game nice graphics . hate that you have to make out of game purchase to improve play . plenty of hints that you need to buy gold .
i was able to play using just an email account . the game freezes a lot , requiring me to restart my device each time . might be fun if it did n't freeze .
simple straight forward game . if you do not want to buy content , then you have to be very patient . something to do with your hands while watching tv .
this is a really fun game , i love all of the time management games based on the original diner dash .
gives me that little slot fix when i ca n't get to a casino for a while . quite realistic , right down to hardly ever getting the bonus . ha !
my daughter just loves this game . she likes the options you can get and use to make the character look how you want . the characters . the leveling up . the graphics are really nice .
the game is ok but took simple for me . needs to be more challenging . would not have bought if i knew it was this simple .
the whole game does n't make much sense and sends you back and forth . more or less running you in circles .
it is fun and easy to play ! i love being able to design my own home ! ! easy for children too .
this game really challenges your mind . you have to come up with the exact answer and spell it correctly . very addicting !
this game is awesome i absolutely love it ! ! i have 60 kill already ! ! ! ! ! stop reading reviews and get the dang game already
i love this game it 's fun and it gets me entertained and this game is new so that 's my opinion keep posting reviews so people know what you think .
cool game cool game fun addictive takes a while to get better scoring but i enjoy playing cool game try it . you 'll like it .
i love this game , the quest to complete that help earn money , the different wonderful dishes to cook and the best part is that you can set it around your schedule .
okay , i have played better games and this gets boring after a while . this is a good game for kids to play .
it is great with the kindle fire amazing games mostly for all ages it is the best app i can nonstop playing
the side stories make it boring , and some puzzles are not intuitive . ca n't beat free , so it 's still worth playing .
the kindle fire version of this game is my all time favorite . it 's easy to play with your fingers or a stylus and a lot of fun when you have to sit around killing time
love it love it love it get it get it get it best app you 'll . love it bet game i love it
this game is fun , you build your own town and turn it into a city , and nice graphics , if you want to fine a game that you can build a city i recommend this one .
great app ! i ca n't believe all that is packed in this app ! this is a powerful little app ! i ca n't get enough of it ! highly recommended !
this game is a lot of fun . it helps relax me and also keep me occupied . i have found that i like spelling more now that i play this game .
this game was way too easy even at the hardest level . maybe okay for children . i would not recommend this game for anyone over the age of 4 .
i really enjoy playing . it has lots of fun games . they are pretty easy to play and some what addictive
just got this game and already know that it is going to be one of my favorites love the bonus
very easy , laid back games . the graphics are cute . animated . this is a good game for beginners . this game is good for kids of all ages . play bingo
i love this game . pretty challenging the higher you go in levels . great to kill time with . considering buying higher levels at a later date .
seriously the best angry birds ever . it is so fun to play and you never get bored and there is always a challenge .
bought this for my kindle fire . works great . fun game not a real challenging game by any means . but nice game to play when you have a few minutes to kill . worth the small price .
i recommend this to anyone who likes 3 match puzzles , loads of fun , very enjoyable and can become very addictive
nicely designed golf game with good graphics . physics engine seems ok. levels are interesting and game plays well . good times all around .
i did not care for this game . it was not what i thought it would be and i removed it .
the controls are very slow to react . i was disappointed cuz this game seems like it could be fun . it was frustrating with the slow reaction time on the controls i stopped trying .
i really enjoy playing this game . i find it very cute and entertaining . u should get this game cuz its now only fun , but its also free . so give it a try .
when you find super hard puzzles but than you can get it i love it very puzzling and kids put their mind to this game for puzzles !
this has a awesome story line and its so much fun its the best game that has ever been put on the amazon app store
full of fun filled learning . never a dull moment . my daughter loves it . she loves to use this app and learn .
why are people giving a 1 star without even downloading ? thats pretty messed up , if you ca n't do the first level im surprised you can read or write a review
love playing different solitaire games . this one has some i like and others i just do n't get . it 's free too !
i really really love this game.. i sit for hours playing it , i take a short break & amp ; i 'm right back at it . thanks a lot for this app .
i love this app even though some of the stuff is locked . it 's still very fun . i would get it if i were you .
i 'm sorry i did not like this game too much so i uninstalled it . not that fun ... .i do n't know . do n't like it .
worked once or twice , was a good bit of fun . now force closes whenever a goal is made on both my phone and tablet
this game is fun because you go from easy ones to hard puzzles back to easy ones again . this makes it more relaxing to me . wonderful for a free game .
not too bad but kinda slow moving . hopefully will pick up a little bit more as game goes on but very good way to spend time
easy fun . it 's simplicity at it 's best . just what solitaire should be . i use this app as a way to relax and unwind when i 'm stressed .
it is very helpful to me searching for info on my kindle fire . thank you so much for the info to get it .
best game in the world it is your favorite of mine is your favorite game in the world it is a good game
i like card games including several types of solitaire . you can play it when you only have a few minutes to a few hours to kill .
what is it for , not too clear for its objective to learn to play to have fun with , too boring
the game is a combination of a city building , tower defense and a rpg . if you enjoy these types of games , hi will enjoy this one .
i chose the rating of 2 as i thought it was hard to maneuver around on this game and play it . i really didnt like it and deleted it .
this is a fun game to play and on most pictures , you have to really think . the pictures are really cool to look out and most to answer puzzle .
i luv this app . it is really fun and you get to name all of your fish and it is super awesome i luv it .
this game is so cool i played the first one and fell in love i waited for the second one to come usually i do n't pay attention to the free apps of the day but now i will
a version of fruit ninja . i know my math but ca n't seem to slice the correct answer fast enough so my scores are n't too good .
if you like crosswords this is a good one . the concept is simple enough but it 's still pretty addicting ; good
i love this game i liked to be challenged and learn new things that prob forgot thru out the years lol
finally here for kindle fire ! way better than the first , only one thing what about the other people ? ! ? they be gone ! still great app better graphics , more options , awesome !
top girl is one of my favorite games on my kindle so far but i tried it girl and i absolutely hated it .
good game for the price . good graphics and good challenge . more games would be better , free would be better ... but good game for the price
find this game not as much fun as others i 've downloaded . seems slow at times and i often just move on to another game .
i did n't expect much from this app but when i opened it downloaded some maps and went on minecraft i had the maps and i could use them ! ! amazing so much fun ! !
so addictive and fun ca n't wait for more levels to come and i just love perry he is my fave
fun at the beginning but then you get to a level that just does n't work on the kindle even when you know what to do .
the game is okay , but , it 's the same thing over and over . although you can keep trying to get better . so it 's alright .
i like these types of puzzles . i have played many different ones . i think you should get a letter for less coins as it can get to expensive to play .
not only is it fun to keep track i find myself doing more to better the out come . very easy to use , and the information they give you helps alot .
fast and easy way to log on and shop . like being able to find items easily from this app . one tap shop
really fun game with a bunch of funny characters and places you can build trust me you 'll have a blast with this game i know i did !
has so many glitches and force stops . not worth the hassle . i ended up deleting it from my kindle fire .
no clear instructions on how to play and once you figure out the game , it get boring rather quickly . glad i did not pay money for it .
yes very nice app and easy to follow . you will enjoy it very much and will have little to no problem learning how to draw if you 've never tried it before
yes a good job for the kindle for sure keep us busy when we have to pass the time away
i think this game is so much fun you should get it it 's the bomb i love it and you will too
the amount of anime on here is incredible . the ads are simple and quick and the videos load relatively smoothly . i very much enjoy this app .
a awesome graphic and it a fun game you can either play on the kindle or facebook . a good game to played .
i wish each game gave more points it will take a while to complete . but i will keep at it .
never got the rules or any idea how to play it , so just deleted it from my device . it seemed stupid to me .

my daughter loved this ! he is so cute , and the noises he made entertain the baby . they should make a sequel !
i love mahjong , but this is more like a trial game ; it does n't have the full options that regular mahjong has .
this game is sooooo fun . it can get a little hard but that y they give u hints a coins to help u figure them out .
i was looking for matching with friends and this game popped up . i have n't stopped playing since i downloaded it .
too much stuff popping up and it 's got too many choices just to play ! ! ! tone it down , please ! ! i just want to play tetris !
i honestly in my opinion thinks it ducks all it does is makes the screen white okay so do n't get it its stupid . its so stupid i gave it a 0 star
this is my favorite bingo game . it 's fun to play and you can win bingo bucks and coins and do n't have to spend real money . and i got it free ! !
same birds , different backgrounds , new puzzles . nothing really special but still fun to play . it 's ok if you have finished the first one .

its a great and fun game after trying once it will be hard to stop playing install it right know .
a lot of fun . some levels are frustrating . children will enjoy playing this game . it really works your mind figuring out your next move and what color to use .
reminds me of farmville . i love it but the only problem is i do n't have any friends to complete the five friends quest because i dont have facebook , nor do i want it .
if you do n't have this game , download it . i have a lot of fun playing with friends and family and every few months forget about it and come back and have fun all over again = )

this is awsome i cant stop drawing . awsome . very cool . when i found out about the app i had to get it
after a while they start charging for the use of all the & # 34 ; upgrades & # 34 ; . free ? not ! save yourself the trouble . use clean master .
this game is tons of fun to play . there is such a variety of songs and artists . i have learned a lot about songs
cool game to pass the time . u do have to buy full version part way through the game but so far it has been worth it .
i like this game because you can speed it up or slow it down for your kids . i also like how you can upgrade without having to actual buy things
i love this calculator and recommend it highly . it is full screen and is simple to use , and the best part of all is that it is free .
this is great educational game . teaches kids colors , letters , shapes and numbers . my three year old granddaughters loved it . thanks
this is a change from candy crush saga . it 's ok but a bit clunky . i do like that you can see what you need at each stage .
i have not tried this yet but it seems like a copy of office jerk . but i do n't know for sure it just seems like it so ... three stars ?
this is one of the best slot game i have found . lots of bonuses and pays alot too . if you like slots this is one of the best !

if you like word games you will be sure to like this one . it is a lot of great fun .

it takes a good picture . i can keep all my photos here or transfer them to my computer . thank you
if you do n't like then just delete it is not a big deal and do n't bring anybody down just because you do n't like it
it keeps my five year old granddaughter 's attention on short rides across town . not something i would recommend for a brain teaser for anyone over six .
very fun game . i wish it was longer and easier to get items . lol . even though i beat it , still play it off and on .
this is a great app from a great product ! music and reviews on the go , anytime anywhere . i have had this app for a while and truly use it often .
great graphics and good story . puzzles could be more difficult and it could have been longer but a good choice .
an excellent tool that i use daily on my tablet . easy to use and very useful tool . recommend for everyone ! ! !
my 9 year old daughter liked this game the first time she played it . but i dont think she has played it that much . i guess it 's alright for what it is .
this game . is easy to learn and addictive ! i play and my kids love it too . we are all hooked .
i thought it was fun at first but it 's really boring and it took way to long to complete the quests .
this game right here is sooooooooo fun except for the hard mission but they have good people well strong people to send out
this is a fun game that does n't take a lot of thought . you also do n't need to purchase anything if you have a lot of patience .
the best horse game ever ! very realistic , it ` s like i really own this horse ! ! ! ! just wish it was easier to collect diamonds .
absolutely love this game , makes me come back every ten minutes to get my coins lol so awesome ! recommend to everyone !
i am sure if i did not have angry birds on my kindle i would try to spend more time trying to understand the concept but it just bored me .
i can not put this one down ! i love the story and the visuals and the challenge . will look out for more games from this company .
this app has really helped me track our bank accounts , no matter where we are . i have n't even used some of the features it offers yet , but am excited to try them .
i wanted to play it really bad , but it did n't work on my kindle , so i had to delete it .
this is a very boring app and i did not like it the game is much better in person that on the kindle
love this game ! its so much fun and when you are bored it keeps you entertained . its not my favorite game but its one of my favorite .
this app is really organized and will help you to take care of your device memory space so if you want to keep your device working properly you need this app .
did n't work out for me , that 's all really . good app , just not for me ya know . decent though , i suppose
its got pretty great graphics and it does n't take up much space at all . gameplay is pretty smooth and i had no problems with the download .
does not work on my lg optimus . sucks because i was really looking forward to this game . so very disappointing .
most of these games are hard to see where or what you need to do next this one has been very clear and easy to advance through .
a entertaining and relaxing game . first day playing still trying to understand game . i hope it continues to keep my interest .
i like the game but i do n't like all the lag that happens once in a while otherwise i really just enjoy playing the game .
very fun and easy to play . i really enjoy the farming portion of the game ! my kids love it as well great pass time game .
it is sometime too hard to determine what answer they want i prefer several other of the word games which i have purchased
i used this for about 30 seconds before i just decided to use my laptop . clunky and confusing to use .
this app is easy to use and very helpful i check it every morning so i can plan my day .
i do n't use evernote much on my computer but the app for the kindle is great ! i can keep everything organized !
this game seems very simple and kind of boring . it would probably be better for a child . i should have looked at it closer before downloading it .
this app is very slow , this app has a freezing problem , this app does not open properly , when opened it will only scroll up and down but not to the side
i like all types of mahjong games and this one is fun with cats . works fine and i like to keep trying to better my score all the time .
this game is full of fairies and mystery is my case . i like this game ... but i would n't buy it if you do n't like & quot ; finding & quot ; things .
and freezing my kindle fire so that i have to do a complete reset . it 's more frustrating than it is fun .
this game is great for days that i get bored . its its nicely priced and fun for on the go .
i am a big fan of movies . this app puts my knowledge to the test . i love it and you will too .
it is awesome there are many upgrades and weapons to get . very entertaining i have had it for a while and i still play it . i recommend that you get this game .
this is a very nice set up for a bingo game . really not much more i can say about this game game .
this game is very interesting i enjoy and spend a lot of time playing it . the levels seem to get more difficult to as i play which i love . it has not gotten boring to me .
the game is very addictive ! i really like it for its simplicity ! i used to love garfield cartoons when i was growing up : )
this game is definitely fun . it is really challenging however . not as easy as it looks . test your skills and see how many you know .
great game to pass the time with , yes i would tell a friend , cant stop playing it i love playing this game
loving this app ! glad to have found ! takes a little getting used to but once you get the basics figured out , it does what is advertised to do . works for my needs !
i 'm so glad that they have a sims and its soooo fun to play and i can see all my friends too . and it has a great quality too .
i wanted an app of abc and tried to see if this was the one , but it was n't . i have removed it from my kindle .
not enough scenes before you have to buy ! do not like to write headlines - if you want my opinion , stop making it harder than it should be .
great app . i needed a calculator that i would always have with me and i looked at a lot of them and this was the best that i found . great job .
great radio app . plenty of music to choose from your local stations to something for off and way out . the got it . check it out . i think you 'll like it .
i love this game it is soooooo fun i 'm so addicted to it i cant stop playing it . the minions are so funny .
i wish i could 've waited for the sale . can i get my 1 dollar back ! ? i like the game and all but , i 'm kinda mad now .
virtual city is an awesome game but if u r a beginner , it 's hard . get this game ! u will learn !
with all these great reviews i would 've loved to at least try the game , but it would n't even load for me . it just kept freezing up .
plays perfectly . no freezes or crashes . different and interesting modes of play with great graphics ( kindle fire ) and sound . great value .
its very slow at first but it is a very fun game so i think u should get this app
very easy to use app , makes ordering something on the fly easy , recommended to anyone that uses amazon
you get to play like a kid , making dinosaurs . you get to build a park that 's pretty to you . the game is fast paced enough for adults and is safe for kids .
very fun game . it is perfect for when you have a little time to kill . i have no problems with the ai .
i love the challenges each puzzle presents . i like the idea that it is keeping my older generation mind active . but most of all i just enjoy playing this game .
have installed all logo quizzes on kindel fire - i have gotten my entire family involved with the logo games
this was the first game i got for my kindle fire and i love it ! ! ! ! also the ads are n't bad at all 5 out of 5
i love the puzzles and the thinking it is really good . my parents think it gets your mind thinking a lot
this is a fun game . i do n't really play these kind of games.i would recommend this game to anyone .
played this for awhile . some of it is hard to figure out but it takes some time to catch on . fast action , cool air craft .
this game changes with every turn ... ... ... makes you think . there is no way to plan ahead . it is most challenging . i love it
i tried downloading this game on my kindle fire , but it would n't work ! it would n't even start downloading . i played 99 for it and it is n't downloading . oh well ... ...
this was as enjoyable and challenging as the others by this company . they make the best as far as i am concerned .
i love this game and play it all the time it is very fun and addicting i love survival mode with this game . probably its best feature
this game is fun . i was surprised . i am glad i gave it a try . the moves are easy . and it is very entertaining . so have fun playing .
this application have many features that supposed to have , but it does n't . the alarm works good as well the timer .
i think that this game is fun . it is very hard . the only reason i 'm rating this is because i want to get a free hint .
it fun for little kids from ages 3 - 7. since its fun for little kids i will give this a 5 star review .
i could n't even figure it out on the fire it would n't go to the location that i put in and it was n't as good as other ones
it is for kids i think , very easy , i like it i am a kid at heart . i wish you could go to different levels but not in burger making
this is a great game . lots of fun and just difficult enough to be addictive . no glitches so far . look forward to many great games .
i appreciate having a more accurate picture of how my phone is using its charge and how much charge i have left . i 've installed this app on all my devices .
this game is a lot of fun , and you can start off with a tutorial so you can understand the game before playing . you can play online as well if you so desire ! very addictive !
definitely different so makes it interesting and enjoyable ... . love the crush the gems ! ! ! ! i can keep playing as long as i keep win in and getting free coins , awesome ! ! ! !
i have other bejeweled games and this one does not compare . i thought is was the same but the spelling is different .
on fire , great app , u can watch movies , tv shows etc . and for free ! u can do it without wi fi too
you ca n't do some things on your kindle that you can in your pc . i basically use my kindle so it 's got limited use for me but it does help .
this game keeps me focused , it is difficult to put down . it makes for a great break after working all day . easy to figure out and it also challenged me to work faster !
i like to do crossword puzzles this one is fast and some times can really make you think and i like to do that
this game is fun , but the music gets annoying very quickly . you can turn it down though and just play the game without music .
fun and silly not very accurate sometimes but still cute i show it to everyone who wants to see the new kindle fire .
if it were completely free , it would be a good game , i like what i was able to play . oh well
i really enjoy this game & like the idea that i can play friends on line . the rules are easy to follow also .
it was a fun game while it lasted but i beat the game so fast it is just a waste
enjoyed playing game , good graphics and flow , puzzles were fun with right amount of challenge . look forward to more games like this .
did n't like how it forced me to rate . at least he start you can say later but that only works a certain number of times . graphics are cute . story lines ok
i have this app & amp ; i thought i could vote on it but nothing happens when i try . what am i doing wrong ?
i guess this is made to work on phones and not just android wifi tablets . so it makes it hard to give it any review . i was hoping this would of worked but oh well .
all of their games are so entertaining . love all the extras and how easy it is to get to the function tools . my favorite solitare .
quick and fun . wish you got more free coins for playing . great for people with limited time . i like to help others with the bonus round .
ok i love apps but this app is not the best it works but then it does n't even give the right answer its ok ! ! ! i would suggest it to my close family but no one else
this game was very challenging . it kept my interest and i could n't wait to get to the end . loved the creative story line . ca n't wait for the sequel .
i 'm rather new to this type of game play but am finding i enjoy it . with the help of the strategies book i was finally able to finish .
this is a great game for all ages and it 's a great time killer . i would recommend the paid version as well , it 's not expensive at all .
i like these types of puzzle games . makes me use my brain and figure out what to do next . not to thrilled about having to buy up levels though .
i ca n't stop playing it . i just love the fun of controlling the little people . one thing i dislike is that the people barely make enough money .
i loved the channel and now love the app ... love the show video clips and being able to get breaking news notifications ... good stuff : - )
this game can be a nice way to relax and be mildly challenged at the same time . it can be enjoyed by a wide range of ages .
i am enjoying this game very much . tried the trial app and bought the full app today . worth the money .
this was a fun game for my 4 year old grandkids ; however at times the game would just shut down or the screen would become small . lost interest in this after a few times of that happening .
i did n't like it at all . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
no strategy nothing . you just keep touching the screen in different places and that is it . that s a game ? not in my opinion .
this is an amazing game that everyone will love , young or old . you should buy it , and love it too .
i played for a day and really did n't enjoy the 2 games . i was expecting more choices for games so a bit disappointed with the product .
this game is solo much fun and addiction u want to build and earn stuff it 's solo cool get it it 's really fun and worth your time : )
this is a hard game to play , not user friendly . it would help if there were instruction on how to play
very cool game . nice effects , and generally a fun pass time game . if you like the simpson 's you will love this game . nice job !
love this game . fast download and great that it was free . i have it on my ipod and now on my tablet .
this is the best weather channel app i have used . the information and variety of information is really great for my uses .
awesome game ! cant wait for the sequel . make more games like this one . it is worth it to play this game .
i downloaded these hidden object games because i thought they would be challenging . once you have gone through the game and know where all the hidden objects are it is no longer a challenge . i am not impressed
this game is very fun ! but there was only one problem . kick off was locked and cost money but other than that i would of rated it 5 star !
i got a new kindle fire for christmas and so it is much easier to read facebook with the bigger screen than on my iphone
can keep up with local news and traffic conditions whenever i need to find out why i 'm stuck in traffic
this app is incredible ! it takes your selected interests and searches the web for anything you might like . that includes pics , videos , and more !
this is one of the better & quot ; escape & quot ; games i have played . challenging , but not impossible or ridiculous like some others i have played . nice graphics also .
this might be great for a tablet , but not at all for a phone . it was hard to control even using a droid x with it 's large screen . the controls on it are terrible .
a very great game cant put it down i love it makes my day go buy fast when i 'm at work so r my sims need more friends though
this game was a super life saver on a road trip . my niece was very entertained four hours and now i 'm hooked
i like this star map best . i searched through a lot to find it . also it does not require being online .
ca n't ... stop ... reading ... rage comics . read all the comics ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! great way to pass a few minutes ... . or lose a few hours ...
i love it . mine is this country and the next generation your food open to all those who want the far
i was playing words with friends but was less than satisfied with the pace . scrabble has given me what i was looking for . worth the price and they have added single player by popular demand .
this game is actually kinda fun ! ! ! but it always has to force close and u never get to play so if i 'm u ... . dont get it ! ! ! ! ! ! !
i found this app limited and not that worth the download . if it had more options that would be different .
great translation app i 'd recommend you use this if you want to learn a new language the easy way . worth the 2 minutes of download time
great fun for the whole family . i challenge my kids by giving then seasons and colors to dress them in .
what the h @ ll ? every droid and iphone has the radar function . i will be uninstalling . when we see weatherbug for kindle ? ? ?
fun game challenging and hard to put down . it is great to have new games to play especially on a rainy day
i am so happy to have this app , but we have not been able to use it yet unfortunately . = (
this is actually a pretty fun game . you should all try it . theme park tablet edition rules ! please try this game
great book to use in church . this is one that i was brought up on and nice to have at a my finger tips
well done with some really good sounds . much better than others i have tried . plus free sounds to download online . thanks .
very fun and easy to use ! i 'm not very good with video games but this is not too hard or easy . i recommend it !
keeps you busy and you do n't need neighbors or to spend a bunch of money to play the game . love it !
i love this game . it is fun and as i 'm a beginner i found it had helped me learn how to play better .
this app is a cool way to do status updates on facebook . i like the different cartoons and how you can really make it look like you !
i just downloaded this game and so far i am enjoying it . the puzzle are pretty easy so far but i hope they get more challenging .
i 'm loving the game so far . only finished the first level and it was n't too hard . looking forward to getting more challenging levels . thanks for the free fun .
the whole family loves this game ! closest thing to the real thing ! fun , fun , fun , and more fun ! two thumbs up !
okay . i think it was okay it 's fun to play but hard to beat . you need to work on graphics and performance .
great pictures ! - gets harder with each one ! the first challenge is to figure what animal , and to get the first piece in the right place .
love this game so much fun to play with the kids . we all love it and have fun trying to beat each other .
it is ok to look around on but that is about all i found it useful for if thinking of the right one
my grandchildren love it wish there was a little more to it its just the same recipes over and over
i would recommend this game to people of all ages . provides hours of fun while requiring thinking . allows u to think outside the box !
my baby sister had this game and she loves it she has a lot of fun only one problem it runs a little slow but still a fun game for little ones
not to bad of a game . it fills the the rainy day and does n't take to much effort . recommend for any one who is bored lol
i downloaded this game for my grandson and i started playing it myself . its so addicting and so much fun to play .
it 's a pretty good light for those odd situations where you really need one and do n't have one on you . i like the way you can change the settings .
whatever i do with it , it turns out really cute , so i always enjoy playing this . it 's so neat and anyone of any age could probably enjoy it .
good at guessing but guess sometimes wrong . just did not hold my attention . it is no longer one of my apps .
just the right degree of challenge for a fun and relaxing game . nice graphics and sound effects . i do think the bear is a bit creepy , however .
i have used yahoo mail for a long time and enjoy using it . i know there are other email systems available .
i really like this game . it 's just like the original game . it 's fast pace keeps you on your toes for the full two minutes .
this game is over quick and difficult to figure out . at this point i am not sure if i like it or not .
not easy to figure out how to play or what each level is about . there is not enough different things to do with .
i loved this game . it is very creative ! but too short . i wish there were more levels in this game .
it lets you know how much time if left before you need to charge it and it tells you how much time for games , videos etc - really good - a must have app
pretty good . not my favorite , but good . useful when i 'm bored . it 's fun and easy , and its always challenging you .
i just got this game but i 'm really enjoying it . you can win chips and power ups easily . i would recommend this game
just really did n't care for this game . it does have a great concept but i could n't get into it . just was n't for me
this a fun game and as you go along , more challenging . i need something to challenge me occasionally . love it ! ! ! !
this is one of the best games i ever played ! one problem , it should be easier to get gems . over all , it 's a great game .
i thought that this is one of the best calculator apps i have ever come across . a must get for every one ! ! ! !
best game ever , i love the walk through right on the screen , ready to use when you need the help ;
great game . but too many foreign logos . and not enough hints when you guess correct answers . still worth getting this app
i love to play this game with the kids . some are easy , some require a little more thought . great way to pass the time .
have 5 bingo games , this is 2nd favorite . seems to always have a surprise . extra games here and there . power ups .
saw everyone using this app on social media and i got curious have n't used it yet but will soon enough .
this is my second time playing this game great graphics . only thing i wish was that the words were larger in the hidden objects areas .
about time there was an edition made for kindle ! makes the addiction so much easier since i do n't have an iphone !
just started playing but a fun game to pass the time . good graphics . kids have fun playing the game too
poor for those who are not good with word games . if your strong with crosswords then here you go . your game .
downloaded based on recommendation from zoo story . not fun , nor entertaining . this app is far worth the money or your time .
it 's a fun game to but but sometimes the game cuts off and does n't let you back in so you lose the coins for that game
entertaining game to play . can earn a daily prize . check it out if you love bongo you will love this game .
i didnt think this app would be all that great when i first downloaded it but its really great and extremely addicting ! love it : )
i love this app a lot . my hubby and i both play and love trying to out do each others city .
thank you for adding candy crush to kindle ! ! ! one of my favorite games ! way to keep up with the & quot ; others & quot ;
was nicely surprised at the game . a bit different than the same ole match three games . the graphics are cute . i recommend this one for all ages !
i usually like to play a card game to unwind before i go to bed and this is great . i loved playing this game with family so it 's been nice to play again .
these types of games are a good way to pass the time on cold nights and lazy week ends in winter
while there are many other uses : daily readings , prayers , etc . for those on the go it is sooo very helpful !
it was impossible to get from one opening to another , going very fast and with a very short amount of time .
this is the only app of 4 i tried to download to my kindle fire hd that actually downloaded and installed . now i can watch my stuff from anywhere . i 'm very excited about this .
wasnt wat i thought it was . n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n

its a pretty cool game just do n't like that you have to pay to play more but other then that i like it .
i love playing this game , it is challenging and great to play . sometimes , the computer makes , i feel , the wrong card to play . however , that is half the fun playing .
game has bugs that are not allowing me to store items and move on . i have checked with online resources and know that i am doing it correctly . finally had to quit after trying 3 times .
i liked the first game but i enjoyed playing this one more . it was more straight forward in a way .
i do n't have time to watch the weather so this is nice to have so i know what the weather will be .
this game is really fun and works your brain . the levels are mostly easy but you may have to do a few a couple of times to get it done .
just enough levels . fun . cool . addictive . i love this app . the best thing about it is that its free . no good apps are free . but this one is ... ..
fun fun fun fun fun fun fun ! trust me ! if it 's updated it will only get better one of the best of this genre !
i downloaded this game because i spent endless hours playing pac-man when it first came out . since i did n't have a joy stick , it was much more of a challenge .

great way to kill some time while waiting for an appointment or your kids lesson to end . fun for all ages .
waste of my time . i know it was just for fun but i did n't have any using this app . took long time to down load
this app wo n't even install on my kindle . it is not worth it . from reading all the other reviews , it is obviously has lots of problems .
my 7 yr old grand daughter loves it . she is better at it then me . makes them think ahead . planning and logic . stop and think what there actions will cause .
i ca n't tell that it has made my tablet faster but it is easy to use and seems to work as advertised .
clean and easy to win i like the lack of a lot of bells and whistles a nice game to play when you run out of points on the other games
my son loves this show that 's why i got the app . and the app is perfect for learning toddlers . there is even a little racing game with bubble puppy .
i have been waiting for it to come out ! ! it is so much fun ! ! i am so glad amazon put it on app store ! !
my son downloaded this app and is definitely pleased with it . he uses it all the time and has no complaints !
awesome game i think i like this because it makes me feel not bored . i also like it because it is a challenging game .
this game is alright . i personally think that there should be no extra letters that u r not going to use . but , other than that , it is good .
i love my horse . i think it is really good because you do not have to spend money . i also like it because my friend plays it as well .
it is really fun . i highly recommend it . it is worth the download . get this app for a good time
i can not even bring this up anymore . also stuck on floor 30 and guide not helping me at all help
i downloaded this game and never played it . it was not what i was expecting , so i uninstalled the app .
fun for the first couple levels then i got bored of it . didnt get any different really just searching for things in the same way level after level .
really enjoy this bingo game . offers a good amount of free bingo bucks to keep you in play . cute music and sound effects too !
this is not the app you want to use for the kindle fire . download the other task killer with the red x. also free , more features .
daughter loves it ~ plays it on her new nook all the time glad it was free for her to get
this game just seems dull and not quite as exciting as some of the tetris games i 've played in the past .
love it ! ! simple and fun ! excellent way to pass the time and enjoy the use of single and 2nd player !
this game is hard using my kindle fire it is not fun do not like it at all do not get this ! !
i like playing this bingo . i would have given it 5 stars if it was easier to get keys and power plays without spending cash . seems to take forever to save up when playing without them .
i like this game easy to figure out , i have it on my kindle wish it would convert to my screen very small to read other than that it fun to play .
bingo beach is a fun bingo game . it helps me kill time during the day . it 's a very enjoyable game .
im nine and i love this game it never freezes like other games and does not have a glitch ! it works great for my kindle ! : ) ) )
fun resource management game . social with other players is built in with neighbors quests and such . worth the download for free .

this is extremely funny and have had lots of fun with this ! i 'd highly recommend this to everyone ! good one !
i really enjoy this game . it helps with eye hand coordination and memory , but there should be another way to earn stars . the process is two slow .
i love the sims i have it for my kindle my ipad my xbox and computer and i love every angle one of them i think you will like it alot
this one was just ok. did n't seem to have to many levels and i got through them pretty quick . its the kind of thing i like to figure out but it needs more levels .
videos were good in sound but terrible in picture . the music videos kept on freezing and sometimes it would stop , so i deleted it off my device .
ok for a while had to uninstall because it took up to much storage in my tablet . would download again
slots of fun great bonus games and different levels they do have coins for purchase but not needed try it you 'll like it
did n't always shoot where i wanted it to . annoying , so i uninstalled . if you can work around the problem then you will like the app .
this is so much fun for kids and adults alike . i can easily kill an hour or two ... . or keep my kids busy for a while !
it worked fine on my kindle fire but i used up all the free levels in 15 minutes . i wo n't be buying it for $ 4 though .
i just purchased this game and so far i am enjoying it a lot . i think this is a great game for all ages so we would all enjoy it .
i did not like this game too much . it was difficult to start . i did not like the time factor for the game .
i did not keep this one for very long . perhaps i am not the puzzle sort but other than that , the graphics were okay .
this is a great game . you will not be disappointed with it . nice graphics and pictures . starts out fairly easy .
bought this for my 4 and 2 year old . just what you expect . i got it free . i could n't see paying for a memory game .
its a cute game it reminds me of hotel city on fb ive only been playing for a short time but so far its enjoyable dont have any complaints yet .
good game overall . wish it was ad free . would be willing to pay for that . would love to be able to change the designs on the deck as well .
i love how i can build my city the way i like it . if there is new stuff in the game . i just ca n't wait to see it .
it will not even load do not get this app it really sucks and it crashes itself do not get this
a very good mystery game . very addicting and fun to play . i recommend this game to anyone who likes hidden object games .
really cute game i bet kids would love it . i really like the animal sounds when you get a match .
this is so far a very entertaining game . i like a game that i can go at my own pace , perfect . also it 's not frustrating like some other games i have played .
i like this app but if it had a different patient u can do and different situations then the app will get five stars but until then it deserves three
not a great app , should be free . why have a camera in the kindle if you need to pay for an app ?
did n't like it . do n't bother w this game cuz it is not worth the effort of writing all the required words .
awesome game love the entire thing u would love it if u were to be in a great mood like i always am
got it for the grandchild and he is n't really old enough yet . i like it fine though . not an artist and makes me feel like i might be able to be one : )
this is a fun game . it is challenging , yet gives you hints on little known brands that can really stump you
a very addicting game with increasing difficulty levels but not so difficult that you get stuck and have to stop . i play this game most every night .
this game is not bad . there are a lot of fun games . the only problem is the time it takes to get the games
this version has many languages to it . i am finding it had to set up an account with this version .
i absolutely love this game . some of the levels are pretty hard . but very challenging ... love to play any bubble games . i like that it 's challenging .
this is the best escape game ever ! it is so entertaining and challenging at the same time , most are too hard and boring , not this one !
i ca n't put this down . a game that keeps you thinking and busy for hours . good for long road trips or doctor office or just any long waits .
i love this game . it has hidden objects plus a good mystery story . also finally a hint option that actually gives you the hints you need . hope to see more games like this .
im sure that this is a fun and entertaining game , but i wouldnt know . i bought the game , but it wouldnt download so i really had no choice but to give it 1 star .
amusing game , keeps me entertained for a while , and works for the kids too . not to hard to play !
simple calculator with big buttons and easy to use . my go to calculator on my kindle fire . what else can you ask for ?
this game is great i play it with friends and family . its very addictive ad i love it very much . !
fruit devil is a really fun game but there is the word devil in it and if you do n't want your kid playing a game like that then i suggest not to download it .
nice game holds my interest . i wish the pieces were a little larger and easier to see . all in all , it 's okay .
never gon na be like temple run or anything but it 's okay but wish you could get coins though the game instead of at certain parts
these crosswords are so habit forming that i have to play at least once a day . great way to stimulate the brain and start the day .
it does n't give me all that need so i do n't use it as much . i still have to go online
this game is ok but i have played better ones . it keeps my mind occupied as well as giving me something to do .
this is an ok game . it gets boring pretty quick . you do n't get to choose categories , you have to search what it gives you .
i like having this on my kindle fire hd tablet so i have something to occupy my mind on the go .
keeps you interested to keep playing , and just busy enough to get you really involved in the game enjoy it its fun . the different levels and speed of the game are great
i cant get this set up to work , maybe its me that is the problem . this app i have never been able to use yet .
not a bad game , enough coins to keep you busy for awhile . fun bonus games . cool graphics . download it , you wo n't be sorry .
it get 's stuck on the last step of level 11 , ca n't complain i got it free . i do n't think i would waste money to buy it though
game was challenging at first but quickly became boring . luckily i downloaded the game for free as the amazon download of the day .
did n't see why the need for the plug in . it just was n't enough to make me give up the messenger . not impressed at all .
i was honestly impressed with this game . i recommend it . the layout was well thought out . the map feature that shows you areas where you have an open task is brilliant .
the only downfall to this game i have found is that you have to spend gold coins to open the high levels . other than that , it 's a fun and addicting game .
great family entertainment ! graphics are just amazing and the sound of the ice breaking outstanding . the music can become boring after a while but you can always lower the volume a bit .
it is nice to finally have security that was needed for the kindle . it appears to scan each time the kindle is turned on .
i 'm beginning to like this game a lot . graphics are really cool . i will recommend this game when you have time to waste and the time will fly by .
another great app for all of us slot lovers that do n't want to spend money . nice going : ) thank you to the developer !
i love tetris and this app provides a great platform for anyone who enjoys the game . once you get used to playing on your kindle - you 'll love it .
i think it is fun because there are lots of things to do on this app i enjoyed it ! you should download this app !
this game is epic and super addicting but the coins should n't be so expensive . they are pretty easy to get so there 's really no point in buying them anyway . still a must buy , though
this game is really fun and addicting . i have played this on my computer and was happy to see it available for my kindle . this game is fun for all ages . have fun playing it .
so far , i have been able to download every song i have wanted in english and spanish . very easy to use . love it .
little grandson likes to play this likes the animals and sits for a while and plays likes the numbers with it
good game . its very fast paced so you have to keep on your game ! i havent made it yet , but i keep trying . i recommend it , keeps you mind working !
it is a fun game but sometimes it can get aggravating . i would never buy coins for this or any other game and would not recommend any one else to waist there money on it .
this game will keep you entertained for quite a while . i would recommend it to almost anyone . it gets harder the longer you play .
basically you keep tapping cookies then you can buy upgrades to get cookies faster . this game will literally eat up your time .
ok so to match and get high score you need to keep looking and matching thinking of the next match if you want to get a really high score for three stars
its fun to kill a few minutes here and there , but it lags sometimes . it needs to be a lot more fluid . still fun though .
this is a very entertaining game . the levels are very difficult to complete with a star , however , you still pass the level without it . city building meets time management . very fun .
if you enjoy just having fun and playing something that 's catchy this is your game . i enjoy the levels and working towards getting the best score .
i really like it though i wish there was more levels but worth the $ 0.99 you should get it if you have a dollar
you certainly get your money 's worth with this game . great graphics and story . i play these ho games all the time , this one was one of the best ever !
excellent puzzle ... only problem , it was completed in only a few hours . ca n't wait for more apps like this one .
i have to rate to unlock a feature i have to rate to unlock a feature i have to rate to unlock a feature
fun to play as and very engaging for the mind . keeps your mind working while having fun . made me use a different part of my brain to figure out the puzzles .
i just used it once to see how it worked . unless you are at a good wireless site that can be used for the length of the item you are viewing not good since you loose the signal .
love the bonus games . like the way each game is a little different from the last . easy to earn more games too . just keep playing and i like to do that !
this was slow and laggy on my device , after all the updates it has gotten better . seems to work alright .
it works on my htc evo 4g and love it . the only thing i would like to see is the ability to print from my mail app other than just gmail . then it would be 5 stars !
it worked great at first , but now it 's not working on my kindle . have n't had time to figure out what 's wrong with it . if it worked , it would be great .
match three fruits is a lot of fun . you can play for hours at a time . good game for the doctor office .
really good content , easy to use . meets all my needs , keeps me updated on what is important to me without the typical media spin .
i am golf fanatic , and there is nothing more that to have one of your favorite magazines with you on your tablet or any other magazine , no paper . nice .
unable to start game , force closes on start up . tried reboot but no success , same with doing a reinstall . good thing it was free at least .
this is he was a great game you should play because my mom told me to get good games so . get it
same as the other fb hopefully time will fix it will try again another day and hope its fixed , i love fb
it used to be my favorite in the world but now , when i try to open it it just crashes .
if you are using the free version it is too short . just when i was getting to it , it was over , maybe the paid version is better
good love it ! ! ! ! it is so addictive i could play it all day ! ! ! i got the free one so but i would not buy if i. had to pay . : /
the game is very challenging . and difficult at times . i spent a lot of time on one level and could not pass it . i lost patience . but it is a pretty good game .
this game is addicting to play . can be easy at times and hard at other times . love this game ! ! ! love this game
love this game ! calm your nerves for sure ! lol got stuck on some levels , but than came back and passed those as well : ) can play it all over again !
it gives you the same 4 animals but it is cute i bought the free version i think that 's why !
definately a game i could play over and over . would highly recommend to a friend . get this app today & hellip ; you wont be disappointed
i do like the game it is fun , but the power plays are far and very little won . i wish you had a way to win more . at least a chance to win .
my 2 yr old daughter seems to like this game . she , however , finds the animals rather quickly . in result , it may not stay on her top 3 favorite game list .
fun fun fun . i love it . great way to pass the time . i love to be able to have so many things to throw and so many fun settings .
i received this from a free amazon offer . it is addicting . i have received lots of questions about the game when i travel .
not what i thought it was . just like the previous rating . should be more to it and less of the advertising
i really really like this dice game . you can play with anyone or your friends . it is fast paced and easy to play . i could sit and play it all day .
the videos show the line that they are loaded but it suddenly stops so i have to pause and then play it and then do it all over again every 3 seconds
when i first saw the free app for this game was n't sure what it was but decided to try it anyway and just see if i would like it or not
fun game . very realistic . the thing i do not like is it is too difficult to find out how to start the game .
what is there to say ? it 's a challenging game . fast moving and easy to navigate . free is always good , too .
i love this game works good on kindle fire and everything best i just ca n't stop loving this app : ) worth the money you pay trust me ! ! !
this game is really entertaining and enjoyable worth the 2 bucks definitely go ahead and buy it its also a good time waster
i love this game . it 's fun and challenging . makes you work to find hidden objects which is why i like the game . it 's unique .
omg ! ! ! i played this game nonlinear but now its on my kindle and its even better ! ! ! i recommend . this for everyone of all ages ! ! ! ! ! ! xd
i love it , very addicting . very colorful . great value for the price . will be playing this for a long time .
i have only been playing this game for a few hands but it is very fun so far . fun , fun .
well ... ... good concept . would be better if there were more free songs to choose from . easy way to waste money . ca n't recommend it .
this really works the other side of my brain . it makes you think about all of the possible choices . i found it fun .
i was surprised they had the star wars theme playing on the game . angry birds , what ever version , is always a lot of fun . i do enjoy hearing the music as well .
hard to use . my finger would n't pick up the words right and it was frustrating to try using this game .
i really like this app for android devices . this is definitely one of the best free ones out there . my only complaint would be that you can not easily add or delete locations .
this sequel was great , all my friends like it so i decided to try , and loved it too . just fun
quick and simple , but entertaining enough . a good entry level for this genre and the graphics are nice . best of all , there are no ads or permissions ! enjoy !
warning ! ! this game is very addicting ! ! ! ! great shooter . incredible graphics . multiplayer . what more do you need ? love this game . would be 100 stars if i could .
not enough to do the game with it seemed like a good idea but it 's hard to level your kindle .
i deleted this game after the first day ... it is hard to see some of the objects ... and on each screen you were looking for the same objects ... no wonder it was free ...
it is a great free app would not pay the 4.99 for it . lots of fun my 8 year old son loves to play it !
i really do like this app . nice to know what is up with the weather at all times so easier to make any plans .
on the kindle it does n't freeze up and it is really fun . i love playing it and it kills time . love the game it is awesome .
i watch it all the time with my dad and i 'm a girl but i love even im a girl
this game was recommended to me by my kids . boy it is fast pace , now my husband and i play it on our devices and we are even in competition ... i am winning of course .
it is so fun and i can never stop playing it is so much fun so that 's why i gave it five stars
game turned out to be more fun than expected . fun for the kids too highly recommended . can also upgrade with money
i like this app . the news is up to the minute so you stay informed . it also has video and stuff to read . i recommend this app .
i love keeping in touch with friends and family . it 's entertaining . i love the picture and videos . i would recommend it to everyone .
even the ads rock 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 . 15 16
i love this game its so addictive and i just cant stop playing everyone will love this game very much . : ) . its soo fun ... ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
once you realize a blank is used for a dash it is all fun and games . know your brand names !
i enjoy playing this game but it is slow and often freezes up my kindle . i like that their are challenges other than letter score .
love it best game ever in the world love in it ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya
this is a good app . it 's a great test to see how you know your bible . it 's also a learning tool to help you know the bible . very fun .
i love that i can play the machine and there are different levels . great graphics . it 's easy to open and shut down . good game .
could not get past the directions . obviously i am not smart enough . very sad . i like math games usually . i may have enjoyed this one .
i am enjoying the pandora app very much because i like listening to music with out interruptions . pandora has many music choices that i enjoy and i can listen on my kindle anywhere .
i could n't ever get my plane to fly . it would always crash . i just could n't get any of the controls to work .
i love this game . the bonus games are great . i also like that it gives me extra opportunities to win coins .
this is my favorite kind of game , i like skill of shooting down the various colors and seeing if i can beat the game . it keeps me working hard .
simply put , amazing . rio works great and looks great on my droid x. thanks angry birds and rio . and we even get to know when the next levels will be available ... awesome awesome , awesome .
this game was not the same game i thought i was getting -- but i play it occasionally . i am getting used to it .
love this game . works wonderful on my kindle fire . easy to lose track of time playing this game . love getting the puzzle pieces !
this has to be one of the better free games out there . i had it on my droid , but it is even better on my kindle .
i am finding it difficult to get rid of bubbles because i just ca n't seem to go beyond the first screen to get to the top . enjoyable but frustrating .
i love this game ! slowly but surely i 'm getting better with each game , and making new friends along the way . recommend to all
not for people with poor vision . i have difficulty seeing a lot of the objects even after i am shown them , but still a great game .
story holds your interest graphics are decent and puzzle challenges range from easy to difficult enough to hold your interest . i would recommend to anyone that likes this type of game .
kicks my butt so it is n't much fun . the reaction time of my kindle fire hd makes it hard to use .
l played this slot for hours and its better than almost all the rest . i give it a very good score .
funniest games there is ! ! ! it ever pays you to play ! ! ! ! it is really a great game ! and i hope this review is helpful
this is very cute ! ! ! great graphics , neat little game . i do n't normally write reviews but felt i needed to because this is a neat little game .
enough said , very disappointed , useless game , wasted the time to download and now ca n't figure out how to get it off my nexus .
it was so boring do not get this app because all u do is just fix her hair and do all that but it is boring
i had the old version of this app . there have been a lot of awesome improvements ! even tho i got the free day one , i 'd still but it !
my friends and i are using this app and have found it very useful . it 's easy to work with , too .
great game but a little bit too easy . ca n't wait for the update . got as far as i could in little over 2 hours
the story line is different which is a nice change . i am looking forward to the next one . my only complaint is i wish it was longer !
this app is entirely fake . it 's definitely not worth 99 cents or 99 coins . do n't get this app ! ! ! really it 's horrible .
this is another game that gets me going the more i find a word the more i want to play
i really enjoy this slots game . i could spend hours playing . reminds me of one of my favorite machines in las vegas .
i was looking for candy crush on amazon , but this was the closest one i could find . i do enjoy it occasionally .
great app love this app i think this app is a great app to have . you should really great app . i recommend this app to others
every time i play this i lose way more than win . complete waste of time and space to play this game ! ! ! !
there are no directions which makes it hard to play . hints require in app purchases . glad it was free . i would be very disappointed if i paid for this .
i really like this app . the backgrounds make this more interesting and exciting . the background music is calming and peaceful and the tiles are beautiful .
this game is fun , addicting , and challenging ! i ca n't wait to get back to playing the game . love this app !
no game instructions . what is zuma ? no fun not knowing how to play . all apps include a how to play .
this is my 4 year old granddaughter 's favorite app to play with . i wish it did more but she seems content with it .
in this awesome racing app you can pick your car and get to the tracks . this amazing app surprised me so much that i ca n't stop playing it !
this game is one of the best i have ever played . incredibly fun , challenging without being overly difficult . ca n't wait for more !
i really enjoy the stories and it is easy to follow . it is just like being on line at my computer .
quite an interesting game . as with the others , not sure about the physics . but the developers do need to explain the changes in the updates . that 's just good practice .
i was searching for an app because i was going on a 20 hour car ride and nothing seemed right i woo found this game and it is incredibly fun and i will never delete it .
the game is awesome and fun to play but it is hard to unlock new weapons . most of them will take more than a straight month to unlock them .
i agree with everyone else . i ca n't see recent posts . i am removing it from my device . i am in search of a replacement app .
i used this and loved it for about 2 weeks then i got bored doing the same things every day and never really noticed much improvement . might be my slow brain but it was fun while it lasted .
i 'm not totally sure how this game works , so far , but i enjoy playing the game and see how much points i can get .
best mahjong out there . i hope they hurry and make some new updates . best graphics , sounds , play . some are so complex where it 's unnecessary .
this game rates about third on the list of games offered as reward in my day care . the older children say it helps them with their spelling tests .
my daughter told me about this because we played it a lot when she was younger so i downloaded it on my smart phone and kindle fire .
addictive ! even my 2 yr old and 8 yr old love it ! ! ! fun times to be had by all ! love it !
it is so stupid all you do is toss birds so bad . p.s . all you guys the space one is awesome get angry birds space a lot better .
this is a great driving game . the only thing i do n't like about it is that gold is hard to get without using real money overall its a good game you should get it .
get this game it is so worth it at first it might lag but then it wont i enjoyed every little bit of this game : )

got this for kindle fire hd . it is fun to play . the graphics are great . the puzzles varied in difficulty . it runs well . i have no complaints .
this is not a bad game . i played it and could not stopped . i am a hidden object freak . but they have to have a story and or mystery to them and this has both .

not really as entertaining as i thought it would be when i tried it . it is ok but not something that makes me want to keep playing

this app used to be great . now they changed to where you have to spend money . they took away free things .

this is the best bingo by far . easy to win and the rewards are awesome . i have n't played long enough to rate the bonuses and power up yet .

it would be great for older children to play with because it is very fast paced but it has a good concept just not good for my 4 year old daughter .
i like it very much . i have just started to play games and this one i will keep on my kindle and iphone .
it is a fun game . it does take a while to get started but still fun . i recommend it for kids and younger adults . after starting it will get better .

now it was so much fun i wanted it on my kindle fire hd and it is just as much fun on it as it was on computer
a new approach to the match 3 genre . great graphics and challenging levels . unique powerups . this could become addictive if it were n't for the 5 lives limit .
a great way to pass time . the ads are annoying , but it is a free app , and you can purchase the app if they really bother you .
i really enjoyed playing this game . i would love more games like this . beautiful story and excellent games . hope to see many more like it .
this game is awesome , it 's so addicting once you get started , i learned , do n't be scared to use a lot of your stuff , it ends up great , get it
i like the game , but you are pretty much stuck playing several hours or days to get upgrades if you do n't want to pay . i did not try the multiplayer option .
gave it a 5 star for music , relaxing , and ease of play . also enjoying the 3 play modes . great way to pass some time .
thought i would like this site . the games just dont get me interested enough to stay connected . maybe it will be fun for some .
it is a very good game i like it it can be very challenging at some times but then very easy
love the game keeps me interested . thought it would be too easy , but it definitely is hard enough to keep you playing the game .
nice game . challenging but easy to play . game to play when time is limited . games are short if you know the answers

i do n't understand it at all it seems to easy ... .. do n't buy it , it is stupid ! ! i regret buying this .
just like the original . i played a few rounds by myself and liked it showing the different scoring options . i would like to be able to play against the computer as an option .
i love how you can actually take care of it like its real i highly recommend this game like i said its amazing i love and you will too and its free
great graphics . i particularly like the hints feature . it 's very helpful and visually attractive . a good game for anyone . worth the money .
a good game for no brain . little thought needed . would be great if your child can not use the real thing . and never wanted to .
i love the fact that you do n't get stuck if you do n't buy gems ! you can breed monsters to get the ones you want and they 're adorable ! i love this game !
this app is a great learning tool . i play my fb friends daily and most of them get more than double my score !
i am rating this higher because i am pretty sure it is better than the rating it currently has . it runs fine on vibrant . it seems like a decent game that is worth a buck .
i like this game totally and completely . you will also . and its much better than the older version so enjoy and pass it on
it was too short and i could n't even try out more than a couple things . the demo ends after the first day and i was just disappointed . : /

i love this product and have one for every room in the house . this product is great for streaming everything . i especially love the ease and navigation of this product .
i recently downloaded this game and have really enjoyed playing it . this game has really held my interest and i do n't think i will get tired of this game .
this is fun . i play it myself even though it 's for kids . it has various levels of difficulty , which is nice .
this game did not hold my interest at all . i would rather just stick with the hidden object games which are more entertaining .
i already enjoy this game on my big kindle in black . & amp ; white , so it will be even better in color !
very creative game challenging . i would love to see a sequel for it . i liked the way they did the hidden object parts of the game .
this game is so much fun . it can keep you occupied for hours . you have to use some brain power if you 're trying to get to the higher levels .
i enjoy this game . i love hidden objects , and this one is pretty good . i like looking for hidden things .
this is a pretty good game so far . the graphics are pretty clear and so far not too tough . like it !
i looks to play a game several times before making a final decision . this appears that it will be a winner .
not worth my time when i found facebook works great without having to put it just for tablet when it gives nothing more
fun to play . download it and start playing . have fun . relaxing and easy to play . begin playing and see for yourself .
love this slot game - gives me hours of entertainment trying to get that & # 34 ; wheel spin & # 34 ; always fun - never disappointing !
i love this game , had one similar to it in a hand held game , the bonuses are great . if you like slots , you 'll like this .
possibly a few thing i might could change , but those would not keep me from paying for this game to support the company .
this game gave me everything i was hoping for shows you how to play awesome theme songs to tv shows and more great game definitely worth the money one of my best games
this is a game that my children play . they seem to really enjoy it and it seems to work very well for them . i would recommend it to others .

my 15 year old needs entertainment and free is ok by me . decent game and no cost is a good deal for everyone .
talk about some cool wallpaper this is it . love , love this for my samsung tab 7. there are hundreds of different wallpaper that you can choose from . love it ...

this game is very easy , but is also fun . i can figure out the answer to the problem in about 1 second .
i like the game . levels get more difficult as you go but not hard . i started with free version but upgraded to the paid version which has more levels . well worth the money .

love this game . advance player of seek and finds and this game really makes me think out of the box .
a great game added to my tablet . hours of fun to enjoy and it helps that it was free to download

it 's good for video or minecraft lovers like myself but i wish that when you buy it they come unlocked
what can be said except fun . it is a fun and quite game which will keep you entertained . get it .

downloaded this onto my kindle for my grandson and he plays until the battery runs down . additive ! better than the free version .
this game is awesome . you should definitely buy this game . you would have to be an idiot not to buy it
this is a very pretty , scary , fun game . i am enjoying playing it . the only problem i have with it is that sometimes the items are too small to see .
love this game , can play whenever i want to and do n't need anyone home to play ! i always look forward to my next turn .
it is okay , but not a really good substitute for minecraft . if you are looking for minecraft , pay the cost .
very cute game that moves fast enough to keep the player interested . keeps player interested with new features and adventures .

good graphics and entertaining . just wish money did n't go so fast . payouts should be larger . overall i enjoy playing to pass the time .
this game is really fun to play because you feel like you 're really working in a hotel . i also like that there is different themes . the themes are very creative .
great app that lets you pick your own radio station to listen to . there is a wide variety of stations available
does what i need it to do . i love the big screen and buttons . very handy and it 's a quick start up .
pac man is one of my favorite games growing up so this is totally perfect for me . my children love it too .

if you watch a lot of tv then get this fun app because it will keep you guessing so get it .

entertaining . i do n't know how far i can get before it asks for money to continue , but its fun right now ...
if you have never heard of candy crush their us something seriously wrong with you . this version plays very well on the kindle . very pleased ! !
this product is really good . especially on my kindle . one problem is that it does take quite a while to load up . other than that its a great download .
i really like this one there are lots of choices to calm your mind and relax good music and sounds .
this game downloaded quickly to my kindle . i 'm so addicted already . get ready for hours of fun and excitement with this one .
to much to do to get it to load , had to call support and decided that downloading so many apps was not worth the effort .
i really enjoy playing this game ! i recommend playing it ! i first played this game on my computer and now i play it on my kindle .
this is one of the best bingo games out there . i just love it.i would recommend this game to anybody ; and the best thing its free .
it is okay . i am not very lucky . but is fun to play . i like the word games better . fun
very nice graphics and game play had a lot of fun playing it . much better than other games i 've tried
wanted a game to be able to play while on the road and this is it ! my kids love it too .
lots of the levels are really hard . though it is kind of fun . you should n't buy this if you 're not looking for a challenge .
i am only on level 3. so far it 's fun ! village is small but growing . hope to get past this quickly . @
i got totally addicted to this game even though i 'm not that good at it . it was totally worth the couple of seconds i had to wait
i liked this a lot . i do n't consider myself an idiot ( thanks , mom ! ) and i found the puzzles challenging . give me more like this .
nice app for the novice user . i do n't know all there is to know about twitter , but it works for everything i need it for .
my grand daughter plays this game . i guess she really likes it or she would n't play it more then 5 minutes
i get people who leave messages but no dates . they are either not interested or i 'm not interested or too far away
this was pretty easy . i did give it four stars ; but i wish that the house had more rooms to & # 34 ; look & # 34 ; through .
but you can play it without having to wait on your friends to take their turn ! ! also it 's a one player game .
some of the puzzles were challenging , but i was disappointed with how short the game was . i think it would be fantastic if it were longer and the end was n't such a let down .
endless entertainment , husband plays daily at lunch . i play in the evening , seems like you never play the same game twice .
i do n't know why ... the app did n't seem very user-friendly . i have it on my kindle but rarely use it .
it was easy and fun and challenging . nice to past the time away . easy to navigate . i 'm no expert , but i enjoyed it .
this game is addictive . i did n't think it would be this fun to play , but i love it . it 's easy to learn the controls and game play is fairly easy .
it 's nice to have a calculator handy at all times . it is right there at your fingertips when needed . works great
not a fan of that software . so i 'm rating it 1 star for that . if open feint was removed this would be a 4 star game .
does anyone know where the crosswords and other games can be found ? other than that it seems a good value .
this is a lot of fun . at first i thought it would be too easy , but the difficulty increases as you go .
this is a good game . it really works the memory . i am enjoying i very much . i have not had any problems with it on the kindle fire .
this was not at all what i thought . i removed this app quickly after downloading it . it is just not fun .
the facebook application downloaded fine and works with no problem . speed is fine and have seen no errors . thank you . : )
abc def g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y and z
it was okay its just an ap . i really not sure what to say about it . i need it for my kindle .
i love this game it 's just like scrabble , and its a great brain game that makes you think and grow .
great game very addictive love playing keeps you entertained for awhile love love love love love love love love love
such an easy and fun way to pass the time . all th animals are cute ! and the game is so easy to play , easy enough to level up that it never gets boring !
i bought this game the day i got my kindle played daily . the update ruined the game completely . so small it is pointless .
i enjoy playing this game . could get hooked on it but i ca n't get past all the buying other tokens or stars
i love this game ! it is my favorite game ever and it is so much fun ! this is without a doubt the best game ever made and it is totally worth the wait .
this app is really great . the puzzles get more difficult as the progress . he has learned how shapes fit together .
this is the best weather app anyone could ever have ! it works great on my kindle fire and cell phone !
fun game as all of the rest of the angry bird games . really like the star wars characters . will have to get the next one .
fun game that sucks you in because you want to keep beating your score . easy to learn and play . addictive .
i have never played this game but my husband seems to like it . he has it on his kindle fire
the quality of the picture was blurry , but other than that it was funny . too bad you could n't adjust the sizes of the faces though
maybe i did n't give it much of a chance but my initial experience was poor . i uninstalled it almost immediately rather than deal with it .
this is a cute little app . my complaint is that it is too hard to obtain diamonds . you must buy them to keep the game moving .
challenges your mind . makes yourself think and make mental thoughts of what the logo could be . very hard and although i suck at it its cool and exciting also fun

fun and relaxing . love the different challenges . it would be nice to have more lives , or to take less time to receive new lives .
it ok i mean i hate that you cant go to the next level until you get s certain amount . but otherwise its alright
this app stops on a regular basis and it is frustrating when i am in the middle of a game .
extremely good app and must have app for every kindle user . easy to use and with nice interface . definitely an app to have .
i would rate this 5 stars if it had n't keep asking me to go on facebook . other than that , it 's fine . have fun .
the game is nothing special . amusing for short amount of time . good for free not so much if had to pay .
got this and several other games in the series . this is by far the best . i play it constantly to pass time when i 'm not busy .
it was fun playing this , love all versions of spider ... .its an easy version to learn with . its a keeper and fun for a time filler when you have a few minutes to spare .
this is a very funny game . you feed candy to the monster . better than angry birds . best game i have .
my granddaughter and grandson love this game the excitement they have when they pop the balloons and the surprise falls from them is great .
this is nice for some people but not for me . it just does n't give you that much info for what your make up would be .
i really like this game . i love word searches and this is great because it not your typical word search game . which makes it fun but a little challenging but not too hard . awesome game !
my friend had this app and i watched her play it , then i got addicted to it , everyday i 'm on it now
i love this game it is really fun and super addictive . i would recommended this game to anyone and everyone .

awesome game to play keep them coming yea cant wait for more games like this this is one cool game
easy game , too short in my opinion , finished it in less than half an hour . plenty of clothes , not enough levels .
really good app - it 's constantly updated with fun stuff . just wish it did n't take up so much memory on my kindle
this game really makes you think . my kids can play the first few levels but that 's it . i really believe it really makes you use your brain . and very addicting . fun
kinda fun for 5 to ten min but gets old fast . wo n't play often , works for when your bored in a waiting room or something .
this app is very fun once you get used to it and now whenever i want to play a game this is the first one .
this asked me to rate it after only three games ... ..i think that is alittle too soon to rate any game .
if you like fighting and puzzle games . you will love this game . once you start playing you will not want to stop . only downside is it runs on energy .
i love this version on my kindle . it 's very user friendly . i can take notes , highlight , cross reference and get many different translations . i wish it was available in a non online version .
this game makes you think . sometimes it seems hard then all of a sudden you figure it out . it 's usually more simple than you think .
this is another word game that is fun to play . i like it very much . i would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys word games that interact with other people .
it is what it is . it is tic tac toe . i like the difficulty levels . the hardest is very hard , but the easiest is easy
one of the best sudoku games available . wish there were more than one a day , so i sometimes play the same game again !
i l love this app . i use it all the time to help me figure out what i need . it is designed very well and easy to use . i recommend this app highly .
good find the objects game with a storyline that 's interesting . works well on my kindle except for not being able to pick up objects the first try . sometimes takes repeated attempts .
once i started playing i had a hard time stopping . i 'm still playing the free part and will probably purchase the full version .
great game . very entertaining and lots of fun to play . i would recommend to a friend and they would not be disappointed
i really enjoy this game . i played it all the time . with my grandma and now i play it with my own children
i love it you could just take a gun and shoot it its a cool game really fun awesome and cool
this is a really fun and addicting game . i am having so much fun playing it and creating new and interesting recipes ! @
harder and easier at the same time than temple run 1. very glad they let you keep your coins between runs though or i 'd never get anywhere .
i think it 's a fun creative game i wish they did a little bit less of the work but overall it 's great .
where 's my perry is an upgrade of where 's my water . it 's my favorite game on my kf . i have almost beat the whole game in 2 days . this game is simply addicting .
mine i think it 's glitch or the app i pressed on it but sometimes it does n't count i get frustrating when that happens other wise it 's a great app i put 1 star because the thing
this games is fun but sometimes crashes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
i play this a lot . it 's fun and a great time killer , no issues with the app itself and you do n't need wifi to play !
it is a fun silly little game that is rather amusing ! you can unlock all characters without in app purchasing !
this application is very useful and good . wo n't use to much memory on your phone and easy to follow . you can get it for free at google play market . this makes exercises fun !
my two kids ( a 2 year old boy and 4 year old girl ) both love playing with this game all day ! !
this game too would not load up so i got rid of it too . it was a free game so i can not say one way or the other .
fun ca n't wait to buy the whole game . wish that i could unlock more levels for free . wish there were more games like this
this game is awesome if u do n't like it that 's just sad i can play with my sister while shes sitting next to me
fun to play with friends . ads are annoying , but it 's better than having to pay money for the app . but it 's a good game anyway .
i make sure i play this game every day it is fun to play it they have another i play every day .
great graphics . needed a pinball game for my new kindle and this one is fantastic . a lot of challenging games .
this game is a fun one to help pass the time . nice for those time that you are just sitting around and waiting , like the dentist and doctor 's . games are short and challenging .
i thought i had the best bingo game available on my kindle , that was until i tried this one . keeps me entertained for hours , and it is free .
beautiful photos of beautiful sites that remind me who god is . easy to use application ... quick download . i like the colors that are so vivid .
i like the app , it does everything i need it to do . i dont have any complaints really , it just works .
i am now on my second generation of families and i absolutely love this game ! its an easier version of sims .
this is another great game . frequent bonuses and good spins . five stars from me . you 're not forced to buy coins .
this is an all time favorite of card games to play . done very well with colors and speed . lots of various settings . this is definitely a keeper !
i have been searching and searching through all the pet apps and games i could find on my kindle for a good pet game . unfortunately , this is not it . pretty boring .
great app to have whenever you need to jam ! love the fact i can listen to any type of music and my local radio stations !
this game is pretty fun i 'm only rating it at 4 stars became a use its not the game for me
overall it 's a fun way to kill time ... i wish you started off with a few more coins . great for all ages .
a very easy game to play . it only has 100 levels . and they were easy to get through . i had hoped for more levels .
got this game for my grandkids and my husband is now addicted to it ! ca n't wait for more levels to be released !
burn the rope as fast as you can . love the idea and it 's really fun playing it . free app . what more do you want .
even with the small screen and format it lets me choose several different news items on different pages . scrolling through seems quick and easy .
i like it but it is n't a favorite to play . it is ok for a 10 year old to play the game .
fun exciting build the town game . there is great graphics and fun missions . the only bad things it takes a while to level up and where you have to buy items . i love playing it .
this game keeps me busy when i 'm waiting for someone or just to pass the time away . i recommend this to people who like strategy games .
this a great game and enjoy playing very much . i played it when i was young with a deck of cards and was glad to enjoy it again on my kindle .
the game was great until i could n't solve the puzzle . did n't realize that you have to pay to proceed to the next question . you ca n't skip - you must pay .
fun and easy game to play , although later levels tend to get a bit frustrating . controls are easy to pick up , and graphics are cute and fun .
this is a family favorite . we all love it and get stuck on it for hours . even the baby plays it . i would recommend
this does what it says it will do and it does it very well if you are looking for these sounds .
i enjoy trying to figure out the logic in the game . it 's difficult and yet quite fun . it takes me awhile to figure out the puzzles .
this is a challenging , great to pass time with when there is nothing else to do if you do not get bored .
this game is okay ... i found it a little hard , on level easy . anyway , soccer scores rarely go above 4 points
game is ok i have played better ones would not have bought if it was not free app of the day .
this game is the best game i have ever played in my life ! the people who have never played this before , i think you should get this game !
i like the game but it takes to long for the energy to refill ! ! ! great graphics keep the good games coming .
i do n't play this game , but it seems to keep my kids entertained . na na na na hey hey hey good bye .
my little one loves this game . and i think it really helps his motor skills for what you have to do in it .
great game for the whole family with a fair amount of tokens given out on a four hour basis enjoy the game
i have this app on my phone , my computer and now on my kindle . it is good for when you do n't have a tv and would like to watch something .
it a good way to pass time as you are waiting . i even like the ideal that you can change to back ground seen on it . nice game .
i ca n't get this downloaded to my kindle . went through process of getting adobe file but it sits in my download file and wo n't allow this app to launch .
this game is easy to catch onto , the shooting is a little touchy , but overall it can keep you occupied while killing time .
this game is terrible on kindle fire . it is very bad you can not do anything with it it is stupid .
i think that everyone should have and like this game . i think this is the best game in the world
this is cute , but is mostly just a time waster . i like to show it to my grandchildren and let them play with it , but even they get bored with it pretty quickly .
i love all of the escape games , and i especially enjoyed this one because i could keep the sound off while playing .
can not see things as i do on my other devices and they jump around and when i select something it goes where it wants
i like to play hearts every day . i ca n't seem to fine how to change the difficulty of the game . i would like to teach the game to my kids .
this game was so much fun to play ! the colors of the different seasons were so bright and beautiful ! i will recommend it to all my friends !
nothing special about it . just ok. no real challenge to it , got kind of boring to play . deleted it from my kindle
nice fun game . if golf is your game to play this will be fun for you . kids will find it nice to play .
my grandaughter loves the cutting his hair and decorating and she can even make him laugh need to get her a little girl one to work on .
this app has gotten worse every day . constantly stopping for no reason . great content but it would be faster to drive to the library .
played this for years in books before , but just downloaded it and played . it was fun . could be more words
it will not load on my kindle ! . & # 34 ; getting right to the point ! & # 34 ; because this box only allows so many words , per box .
yeah again , only was able to watch on computer so now it awesome to catch my shows elsewhere as long as i can connect
it was not challenging enough for me , it is best suited for children . i like angry birds better and it more fun
it is fun , though there are apps that are more fun than this . i have more story apps that i need to keep track of .
finally a game that says it is free and it truly is . i give it five stars just for that . and the game is fun to thanks for making it .
i like angry birds , it helps to pass the time and i like it more without the ads . thanks for that .
my husband loves having this on his kindle , he watches it all the time . he says he has access to movies and series that are not found on netflix or on hbo on demand .
this is a little too repetitive for me , but it is addictive and i keep trying to get to the next level .
this solitaire does n't allow you to keep track of your scoring , turn 3 cards at a time , etc . overall i did n't enjoy playing it at all .
if you are looking for a quick game that will challenge your memory skills than this one is for you .
i had absolutely no problems using this app . it was a huge help in the kitchen . you 'll wonder why you never got this one .
very cool but coins are so hard to get i play on medium mode you get 2 coins a level
i like games like this and so far this is a good one . if you have patience then you do n't have to spend money to play the game .
same thing as flappy bird . very fun and addictive . if you ca n't find flappy bird get this . my high score is three ! ! ! ! ! ! !
this game is very fun . it is also a quick game . i wish the graphics were a little bit easier to read . i will play this bingo a few times a week
i play every night . no different then any other bingo , i just enjoy playing .
this app will not work unless you have cable television thru them . it will not give you television channels for free .
this app is adicting you should get this app i really like it . there are a lot of apps like it . i reccomend them all .
ok , some quotes are suitable to go into a card , but not enough .
it 's a free app and my boys like it . gives them something to do while riding in the car or waiting .
a fun hidden object game with puzzles that do n't frustrate . a good game to play , put away and play again .
yeah its cool but i deleted it cause i got mad at a level but its pretty cool ! you should get it .
such a fun and addicting game . lots of fun to try and solve each level . for people of all ages !
i enjoy playing this game . keeps you thinking . the different monster provide a different twist and the students challenges keep things interesting . i recommend for a quite evening when trying to relieve the days stress .
works fine . i 'm going to have to get used to using it on the kindle - it 's different than on the computer .
although there 's a line of fire , the bird does n't follow the line . i prefer the other games . there 's no reason this game should cost $ 3 ... not worth more than $ 1
i purchased this app for my grandson . am very pleased with this . i highly recommend this to anyone . two thumbs up !
i have always enjoyed playing scrabble , but this game is a lot more challenging . if you have not tried , please do . i am ready to challenge you
this game is real fun . it has the best virtual life on amazon . i really enjoy playing this . it has a long time for waiting but other than that its real funny ! !
i really like family feud & friends . i wish more of my & # 34 ; friends & # 34 ; played , though . lol . it is a cool app . no complaints .
love this game . the levels are difficult enough to be challenging but not too hard for you to be successful with a little thought . very addictive . ca n't wait for the sequel .
love this game ! my husband got me started on this game and now we go back and forth on who can get the highest score . so fun and addictive , you 'll love it !
this version is better than the facebook one also i like playing games on my tablet not so much my computer . the colors are vibrant the content is better and not so much wait time without doing anything .
it is what it is . i like to catch news from several sources . cnn is not my first choice , but the app is great and easy to use .
just started playing and wants rated already . a little to soon but so far it 's okay . you spell what the pictures have in common from a list of letters that is showing .
it 's really fun but needs more hints or need to be able to win more coins . but still it 's fun
i love backgammon . the only problem i have is that i believe the game may be cheating me . the game usually wins .
it 's nice to have a how to guide in a style that i do n't usually use . i do n't like buying apps , but it allows you to go through things without paying for a while .
check this every day . there always is something in the news that i wo n't find out until later in the day or tomorrow .
its not that good but its sorta okay but ive played better games than this . it actually is boring kinda
this is by far my favorite android game . it is very challenging but at the same time is relaxing to play . the music and the graphics are wonderful .
very nicely laid out . clear and easy . i love this free app of the day , just what i needed ! would recommend it
not enough free play . wants you to purchase dollars . not enough time to enjoy before you are asked to purchase points .
i use to play this all the time and it 's fun , but there are other games that i just like playing better !
i certainly think it is worth the 99 cents i paid for it . really glad i did n't spend the five bucks it originally cost .
i downloaded this on my kindle fire and it works great and does the job in helping me to relax and concentrate when i have too many things on my mind .
wow . its pretty good , with ways to get to different levels and you have to work to get to the next level .
i like it , it keeps you thinking on how to do this on each level . it may look easy but its harder than it looks .
this wo n't save my progress ! ! a bunch of other reviewers said that too . extremely annoying . gave it a star cause it 's really fun .
could n't get it to work while using words with friends and gave up after trying too many times . this is terrible .
i did like this game , but it seems it crashes way too much anymore and will barely load . i hope that this app will be fixed soon .
the games are easy to navigate and fun to play . there are lots and lots of different ones which is nice . i thought maybe it would be limited .
just like the original restaurant story except with a few special items and deals . same problem i have with all games like this , you ca n't get far with out having to spend money .
lots of fun . just got it , so far so good but has stopped running not sure what 's up with that ?
i have n't actually had a chance to try this out yet . i 'm looking for something to try it out on .
good way to pass time . the bad is you run out of coins to fast ... you can not buy new clothes without coins
it 's a fun game for me and my girls . they fight over who gets to feed her or brush her
this app is like 2 in 1 ! you get to play hundreds of games on one app and can spend a lot of time . truly fun !
this game is a lot of fun and very challenging , but it was over way too soon . i am hoping they come out with a sequel .
love the game it helps pass the time away without losing all your money and you also get to meet new people
this game was just no fun for me ! i thought i would like it but found myself bored with it .
this app was very disappointing did n't do what i expected . it failed to open on my kindle for several times .
this one would have gotten 5 stars if it had been a little longer . great graphics and storyline that kept my interest we 'll . i finished it in one day .
very relaxing . picking out the fish is a lot of fun and they are so cute . everything also looks so realistic and detailed .
netflix is a great thing to have on your devices . easy to use and great movies for young and old !
i just love it . at first i did n't know what i was doing but it did n't take me long . it really makes me think before i start moving my stylus over it .
this game is both fun and challenging . i played this game on someone else 's tablet but could n't get it on mine at the time . i was excited to see it was now available .
i have played on facebook on my computer for a long time but got addicted enough to have to have it on my kindle fire also . challenging and addictive , always something different with every level .
this game is very enjoyable ! the puzzles make you think and the graphics are very nice . i look forward to each level .
what a great game . it brings back wonderful fun filled hours . i love it and would recommend it to everyone .
i love this game . it is a fun & # 34 ; action & # 34 ; game . the characters are cute and funny and the scenery is great .
this is a great time killer but i only give it three stars because it is hard to progress . after a while i lose interest and shut it off .
i cant stop playing . plus i am even better with words with friends . i love playing this game . awesome game .
my idea is then at well this games is ok i mean it 's not that good if what they say it 's amazing but then when u play with it it 's just boring
maybe it 's me , but i have better , more fun things to do with my time . perhaps , i 'll try another time and like it better .
its not the greatest , but not the worst , its ok , the game is fun for about ten minutes then you end up losing interest .
based off of real life actions , in this game you mine gold to earn money and advance to the next level , you can buy upgrades to help you along the way .
love the hidden object games . very challenging and fun to play . love playing these games with the challenging that come with the game .
yahoo is very easy to navigate and to keep up with news and whats going on in the world . it 's a good place to have an email account as well .
overall , i 'd rate this version of solitaire a 4 out of 5. i did n't care for the ads before the beginning of the game .
very fun and addictive game . if you loved happy fall then you should really enjoy this game . i cant stop playing : ) .
this game was fun to play . it has a good theme and a good story line . good for people who like hidden object games .
downloaded and played . did not like horrible to play.i did not like this game and would not recommend to friends .
sometimes , when i try to win at the night club , it freezes completely . if this was fixed , the game would be perfect !
just started this game fun so far will see how it goes . it has me thinking a lot but that a good think
this app is a good one with the exception of the ads . been using it for several months now , and the down fall is the ads . please offer a paid version .
oh , what a game . keeps you on your toes . i would truly recommend this game to all of my family members and friends .
only one of each game in the light version . so cute and educational that i bought the whole version immediately .
simple , easy , well designed . save it from your computer , read it wherever . this is one to keep . you will use it .
my daughter had played this game with someone at school . she loaded it onto her kindle and has played it alot . she loves it and she said she loves it !
this is great for kids . it is very entertaining for them , when at the dr. 's it keeps them busy . great app .
would be great if were n't for the constant screen flipping . i tried everything to stop it but nothing would ... very disappointed because it seems fun ...
if you loved the original tetris , than you will love this game . it is a classic game that never fails to please .
i do n't have a lot patience for games , but this one is pretty clever . i do n't think i have ever played anything like it before . works great on evo 3d .
it 's a different hidden object game . it 's nice for a change . i only hope there 's a part two . maybe in the future if possible .
i love having this bright little flashlight right at my fingertips ! it 's handy in so many situations . best of all , it 's free .
my kindle now has a camera . i think i am going to like it . i look forward to using it to take lots and lots of fun photos .
this game is addicting . i play it often . i love it when it says , ho , ho , lets go . silly are n't i ..
i like the game but you seem to only be able to play 5 minutes before it wants you to buy something because every mission seems to take all the energy you have
like it a lot better than 100 floors . i 'm looking forward to more rooms . update soon please . my review is too short ... so i 'm adding this line .
this is a fun and challenging game with lots of hidden object scenes ! absolutely love it and totally recommend it !
i enjoy using facebook in my spare time . the kindle fire hd is easier to use than a smart phone and laptop .
it is okay if you like puzzles , bored and want something to do while passing time . however , the puzzles are so easy you can complete them all in a flash .
this app has sooooooo many awesome wallpapers its hard to choose just one . i like that you can save your favorites for later . would recommend this to everyone ! !
this game is ok but i 'm not that crazy about it , it seem a little tedious and hard to find the objects because they are so small
i have just started and its already awesome and addictive i wish it was on the kindle fire earlier yeah
i loved the first game and was excited to see a second title had come out . i hope to see a third installment soon , it will be worth the wait .
i love being able to print both from my android phone and my kindle . does a nice job from both devices .
this is a fun game with easy but fun puzzles . good graphics and a fun story . this is the first game from this company . will probably buy more .
download this for my son and he loves this game . he plays it all the time . i love that fact that he loves it and it didnt cost me anything .
i 'm just playing the trial but so far i am enjoying the game . just hard enough to make to hunt for an item but easy enough to play . i like it
i thought this was just for kids but i find myself playing it more . when i have to quit , i keep telling myself just 1 more which then turns into 2 or more !
this app is great for any kid or even an adult basically any one who knows their old school cartoons to this year cartoons .
love the game but wish i had realized the app i bought on the amazon market on my kindle fire was n't a version that would work on my kindle ...
a little confusing at first , but a really fun game once you get the hang of it . keep getting better !
love this game it makes time go by quick and i like to figure things out . that 's why i would recommend this game to a friend
lots of fun off the hook game , i 've played lots a slots this is a most enjoyable game easily played , have n't played anything else since i began this game
i think it is a very easy game to understand and it is so fun and it is so exciting
love it its fun and time consuming although i would love to get the version it 's a must get its awesome
i am an older adult and i love this ! it 's just mindless fun but sometimes that 's exactly what you want !
not bad but you have to wait for gems to fall which can take awhile . it be nicer if you could get a full lot to work with .
starts out easy , gets more and more challenging . i end up playing way more than i should because it 's so addicting
my grandsons and i are huge fans of the original doodle jump . this variation is terrible and has been deleted from our kindles .
the game itself is fun , i would just like to be able to play it offline . i do n't have internet access at home .
i like games like this because . i 've always wanted to be a big sister . you really need this app if going to be a big sister
if you do not watch out this game will help you pass a lot of time . even my son loves to play .
very fun and addictive game . mega cute graphics . very challenging and lots of fun . great game and free . what more could you want ?
this app is really good because you get to not only have the original talking tom but take care of him at the same time ! i recommend this app for anybody and everybody .
have to agree with others about graphics of this game and also am becoming a fan of this developer . playing a few of their games and enjoy all of them .
like the alarm clock feature . the other sites within this app are great . i really do n't have 7 more words to add to my review .
i love this game stopped playing than came back to it now i ca n't stop playing it . i recommend everyone to play it .
this is a wonderfully intriguing game that increases in difficulty at a very nice pace . music and sweet creatures are relaxing while not boring .
best game ! play all the time . highly addictive ! do n't ever change except to add more vehicles or levels . and it is free too !
i love playing solitaire . this one is interesting so i thought i would try it . i do n't play it a lot , but it is fun .
i love this game ! it is so cute and highly addictive . cant put it down even going to pay the 3.99 for unlimited play so worth it
graphics are gorgeous , music is beautiful and play is just hard enough so you do n't get bored ! love it big time !
very addictive . just when you think you 've got it figured out , you find out you do n't ! fun game ! should n't have to pay for more hints !
it was my casual pastime while my girls were in school . i get bored sometimes . it helps to have another pastime .
this app is awesome . i really like how there are different kinds of games for everyone . my favorite kinds of games are puzzles and challenging games .
i rated it high because it 's a challenging game , that works well for kindle fire because of its size . and detail .
neat little fun puzzles . my little girls really like them . and its free . what could be better ? this is a must if you have little ones .
i 've only been playing a short time but it is fun and challenging . i guess i do n't know as many logos as i thought !
this is a very fun app for my kindle fire ! my grandkids enjoy playing with it and creating beautiful pictures .
it was fun to play . why do i have to have at least 10 words ? it 's a simple app , not a freakin ' complicated purchase .
it gives you choices on what live wallpaper but then after u pick it it goes way . its a nice app but if ur looking for a live wallpaper do not install this app .
i never get tired of this game it challenges you no matter how many times you go back and try doing it to better your score .
i like playing this new game . it is a little hard to get the cards where you want them to go . but over all it is a good game .
i play solitaire quite a lot and now i can play while i am in bed at night . it 's great .
a very addictive game . of course the minions are cute . i wish that you could win some of the coins instead of having to purchase them .
love this game . i can not believe how hard but easy it is . it is so much fun . love it .
every time u get done playing on the map it 's asks you : get full version : which is very annoying so no i will not get full version
the pics do n't load for me . the app offers upgrades for additional money . i wish i knew this before i downloaded it as i do n't plan on purchasing the upgrade .
the game is pretty fun but after awhile it will get boring but my son seems to like it more so i keep it for him to play .
its a little tricky for a 5 year old but with a little help its a fun game for kids !
it helps kill time and when i ca n't be with my own horse this helps me not miss her too much . my children enjoy it too
fun and exciting game that will give you hours of fun ! enjoy playing this with your kids and even learn something together .
the game was as fun as chess most of the time you don ` t know why you died in the process .
i have been playing all afternoon between 2 games . it has been a great day . i usually do not get that much free time . thank you it was fun !
this app is misleading . i thought i liked it when i got it but then it really started to bore me
having fun just looking at the pictures and seeing the animals . enjoying guessing what is behind the covers . ca n't wait to see the other games .
i downloaded this a couple days ago and i love it . it 's a unique and challenging game , definitely worth the $ $ .
pretty fun game ! ! ! ! i just started ! ! ! it takes awhile to get used to and it takes forever to level up ...
this is a great game , requires a little thought here and there . more levels would be nice . especially like the bonus levels !
easy to use . has different solitaire games in it . i only play the 3 card flip style but you can play any of the others at no charge also .
the games really fun if your bored and it 's fun if you know the movies ignore the bad reviews you should get this app
this is the best mahjong app . that i have found . lots of different levels . choose from many different backgrounds and playing designs . in a word . awesome .
it 's a okay game as long as it do n't get started same ones after another . i really enjoy this game more than people know
this is great to have and be able to read every morning before starting a new day . no complaints from me .
i have a number of slots games and this is a favorite . the graphics are very attractive the operation is smooth . you get a nice size bonus which allows you to keep playing .
got it for free but it is a great game to play and get addictive to when you really start playing
i believe this would be okay for some who are not looking for a mind boggling experience . i prefer other hidden objects game better .
has limited formats ! ! but it will do a professional job with the photos you choose ! ! excellent photo tool ! ! ! ! ! !
this game is so addicting and fun ... i like how i can play with people from around the world ... it 's a very very fun game : )
ok for an angry birds copy . it does n't seem to progress as smoothly though . maybe it 's just me but angry birds seems to be more fun .
great game to keep the mind and eyes alert . this is the best game for older generation to keep the mind and thoughts going .
because it has fake facts and most of it i know . the cool things are there is true facts too .
fun . keeps me entertained for hours . the more i play , the more addicting it gets . five plus more words required .
quick and easy to play . just swipe from one item to another . good for any age . gets harder on each level to keep your interest .
it is a good game but i hate waiting for hours for some thing to get built but everything else is good
i want to give this 5 stars . but it has no landscape mode for my tablet . please fix to auto rotate and work with tablet to get

this game is flat out boring . not worth the waste of time to download and install . would not recommend at all
this is a fun little app . some of the riddles are tricky , but you can figure them out with the letters they give you .

its wont let me go to the next level until i get all of it logos right hey but just one problem i said
so much easier playing on the tablet than my phone . enjoying playing . do n't need to know how do draw well , just need the desire to have fun .
i really like word games . but there really isnt much of a word game here . just another match 3 type game . blah ... uninstalling .
i like the way it challenges you on every hunt but it takes gold , coins that you need to buy things , faster than it gives , other than that its real fun
this game keeps me excited . i would have to say its one of the best to play on kindle . i give two thumbs up .
this app constantly crashes on me , and it was n't really worth the time of trying to download it to play it on my kindle fire . would rather use the pc for this one ; )
my older son plays with this good app . it is easy to use and time certainly flies . to stay at home with family and share with them
the quality is good and you can change the set up of the deck and game rules . it has ads in between games , but you can skip them . you can play without internet .
i think it is nice 2 hav a conversation even if it is the same one every time . cute game .

this game is original and very challenging . i wish the tutorial was a little more thorough , but i suppose that would make it too easy .
i enjoyed this game a lot , but it was really annoying that almost every time i wanted to play it , it would freeze up my kindle
where 's my perry , and now this . temple run . brave . no connection . brave was n't even a good movie from what i 've heard .

i absolutely love this app . the quotes are always inspiring and right on time . i just wish it had a widget .
this is very cute . my grandkids thought so too . i would say it is for kids 6 and under . but i liked it too .
i give it 4 because it would be great for a very young child , my daughter is 4 and it was extremely easy for her , so i would n't recommend it for a child over 3
completely , 100 % free . if you want to leave a rating , that is ... .. i love these games for that reason ... . and they 're super fun !
i got my son this app and he absolutely loves it ! it 's a nice little learning app for kids and i notice him thinking and solving through the exercises .

this game is hard , but not too hard . also extremely addicting . and its free . stop reading reviews and just download it .
it was not explained well enough , not sure how you play this particular type of game . i 'll pass on this one .
it takes forever to load i waited ten mins and it still was still loading . and u cant get off until fully loaded
this game is cool , not to hard but it is challenging a good free download , it will make you think and is a good time passer . try it .
facebook has let me stay in touch with friends and family in many different ways . i see many interesting videos from youtube that i would n't have seen otherwise .
our daughter loves writing in alphabet using this app . she likes to use a many colors as possible . it entertains for whenever we need it .

this game is so much fun . i ca n't put it down . some of the puzzles are harder than others but it gets easier the more you play .

this game seemed like a lot of fun if it was your type of game . i thought the different pigs were cute .
i loved this game when i was young . still a great game now . my son gets excited when he gets to use the kindle so he can try to learn this game .
- game play is too slow . was hoping things would speed up after 3 or 4 games but they stayed at the same slow pace . graphics & amp ; sound are ok .
this is a good variety of bingo games . you need to pay attention , but no way are you bored as it goes fast .
this keeps my toddler occupied . i like how it teaches cause and effect . it would be nice though if most of the animals made their actual sound .
this app so supposed to enhance photos for better clarity but did n't see any difference in the photos . not reccomended for anyone who needs to clear up a blurry photo .
it 's a very interesting game . i love seek and find and this one is very challenging . thanks for offering it
i have found many uses for this great light , one of them is reading at night . i use this light to read at night so i do not wake everyone up . works so great !

if only it was the full version . but since it is n't i do not ha e fun with it . what the heck !

i like it , it 's a easy pull out and play game for any time fun . i recommend it to all . = )
this game took too much memory on my phone and ran too slow . i had to take it off my phone .
i found this fun in the beginning but after you know where all the items are , it gets rather boring so i deleted it . maybe if it had more levels .
allows you to review and manage your apps very easily . very useful app , highly recommended . matter of fact , i think it is a must have app .

was not thrilled when i found it was a puzzle . but when i started working on it really enjoyed it . i especially like the beautiful plant puzzles .
game is a unique take on puzzle games . so far i have completed a few levels . i am disappointed that it cost money to get hints . which is why i choose 3 stars rather than 4 .

its very very cool i love the pets they are so cute i wish they were real omg the kids
i did n't enjoy because the game was slow and really no potential for me to play as i was not challenged enough
controls are a bit small and it does n't have a lot of replay value , but it was free and fun . ca n't ask for much more .
this game gives you a lot of styles to pick from . if you get stuck , you can shuffle the tiles and go on until all the tiles are used . rather than just having the game end .
a brain teaser , my friends think that its a great game . i love it.it 's a lot of fun . play it all the time .
great ! ! my 3 year old enjoys all the puzzle games on this app . good way for him to learn . thank you .

it no longer works . it said it stopped working and i do n't know why . it gives no explanation as to what to do once it says it has stopped working .
i am a huge bingo fan & this game is a lot of fun . the only thing that sucks is how long it takes to get credits . definitely recommend if you are a bingo fan .
i especially love that i can play off line , sometimes i do n't have internet so that worked out for me . fun .
enjoyed playing this game . a lot of going back and forth , but still held my interest . i like hidden object games with a story line .

easier to navigate than weather channel app . glad i found this one . use it at least once a day . great
i like this game a little more than some of the other hidden object games . this one keeps you on your toes .
the game is enjoyable but sometime tiles are hidden under the stop , pause or go back keys on the right of the screen .

i wrote down stuff i needed to get done and with this app on my kindle i could check it easily to see my progress . it works very well .
it 's ok. i just wish there was a way to skip to the next word when you are stuck . also there should be a feature to scramble the letters .
it takes a little while to get the hang of this game but once you know what you are doing it is a lot of fun . could be addictive .
this game is very challenging and i would definitely suggest that you get it , the greatest thing is that it 's free .
cool game . its pretty fun like the others but i loved that it was for movies only . its definitely challenging but its exciting at the same time
good game . good graphics . could describe the guns and upgrades for them better so i know what my money goes to .
its a real fun app , but i think some of think some of the games are actually quite hard . but their really fun too . so it makes this app such an adicting app .
i like this game though clues without words make it difficult to figure out but i like the challenge . nice job creators .

it was n't the best but it was fun but it can get very boring when you play it so much do get it if you get board really quick of games .
this app is so bad and the music gets on your nerves . second , the kitty goes too slow and its hard to maneuver .
any girl that wants too have great time it is great and all the people that says it is bad they are wrong . : )
ok graphics on a timed game but the objects do n't disappear or turn color or something so you know you 've found them . not worth the buck
ok it says free however it only lets you play so far then it wants you to pay for the upgrade
lots of fun and hard to put down . it 's a great game for all ages to enjoy and easy to follow .
the game was fun and had good graphics . it only lasted me about ten minutes before it was locked due to me having to pay for the rest of it . not truly free .
great game . not the most or worst . but good . not a terrible game but not that great either . it is good .
maybe because i watch a lot of movies but it seems too easy a game . i would recommend to others .
not exactly what i was looking for but fun . i like hidden object mystery games and this one is fairly easy to play .
it pretty much does the work for you . it is not real challenging . i got bored with it really quick
i would say that this game is fun . it also has a problem being consistently harder as the game goes on .
having lots of fun playing it . i love playing these kind of games . very entertaining to play . i would get it again .
it was n't exactly what i thought it was , but it 's okay . do n't get it unless you 're very familiar w/ scripture verses .
i thought this would be a lot of fun to play this game but not so , maybe i do n't understand it totally
this game drives my cats nuts ! they keep looking for the animals . the game is fun for me too . love it !
great word game and one that can get addicting but in a good way . really makes you use your brain .
i love this app . this app is extremely adorable . the monsters are very cute . i recommend this app to any of my friends .
classic word search game , fun and different levels of difficulty . would recommend for anyone who enjoys to do word searches
i did n't mind this game but even for a free one there are n't very many puzzles available , most of the puzzles and features are behind purchases and the ads are annoying .
i love this game.. i was hooked right away and even while away on vacation , i played for 5 hours straight . definitely download this one !
love it and i 'm just doing this for stuff it 's just awesome i like this more then anything i just love it
i love this game ! it is so fun and make s you think . it is an app for kids and adults .
i love it . it 's so much fun so many weapons lots of fun you should get this app and rate it
i ca n't put it down . fast paced and keeps you looking for the objects . much easier than some of the other games out there . highly recommend .
my sister got me hooked on this game it is interesting i most say you do need to thank on some moves
this was not what i was looking for and did not give me the information i was looking for but i plan to keep it for future use and hope to find it more helpful with more use .
i just love pinball so i dont have much to say about it , it takes me back to the good old days
good game but after i played it for about two weeks i checked my gallery of pictures on my kindle and there were about 200 random pictures of gameplay buy game but check your pictures
this is the game everyone has been talking about and it is finally on kindle , still trying to get it but i am very happy to be a part of the candy crush saga family ,
some are not very good differences just the name of the object does n't really mean the odd one too much to use a hint so get stuck easily
i love this game on facebook and was so happy to see it for kindle . great graphics and colors . ca n't wait to see how far i get .
very good close to flappy birds . my high score is n't that high but it is still amazing like flappy . birds
i play this on my android phone and my kindle . great game , works quite well , never freezes , great graphics . probably the most reliable app i use .
love this game . love how it has so many different levels compared to the other slots . the graphics are pretty cool too .
not what we expected . thought the kids would love to play this but it does n't keep their interest at all
the play gets more and more difficult as you go along . a simple concept that takes much concentration . lots of fun .
this game is a very good game . you can level up , and earn guns . you get money for every game you play . very addictive too
what the heck is with all the permissions ? why do you need to know exactly where i am just so i can throw some crap at a zombie ?
i love this game . have played it for years on my computer and was happy to find it for my 8.9 & # 34 ; fire . easy to play and a lot of fun .
all my grandchildren love this game . it is nice to have it on the kindle ! it made a trip to the dr. much more entertaining !
this is a fun game . can be challenging at times but the hints help . you should get it . fun for kids or adults . test ur knowledge
i love the fast paced game play . i have played for a few hours a day and i love the game . my grandchildren play it and i have a great time trying to get the best score .
never get this app.i did not understand it and did n't really get the point of it it is so stupid .
used to play this game on the laptop and it is much more fun on the kindle fire great job can not wait till the next one is released (
i enjoy playing the game . i find it a bit to small and it makes it hard to play , also i do n't like to be timed .
i am not fast at making words . maybe if i played more often i would see words faster . i try too hard to get big words . it is entertaining and works my brain .
i really enjoy using this app . the word searches range from easy to hard and for me at least i always felt challenged . i recommend this app for everyone 10 years and older .
lots of fun games . you play for points to unlock more games which i like . there is something for everyone . a must have !
this app is terrible i thought it was for the kindle but its for phones i was soooooo mad ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i wish it had more stuff to do i am super mad
g5 did a fantastic job with this game ... different types of games that i 've never seen anywhere else ... even from g5 ... i am very impressed ...
this is really awesome . i love drawing characters from a good game ! i really recommend this to those who love to draw . these drawings are step by step , too !
i like the puzzles and how they all work together to get you to the end . excellent little game for the price . fun to replay . works well on kindle fire .
love it . love it on my pc for years love it even more today . try to play as much as i can
this game is really fun and addicting , i had the game poo fall , it was fun bit then i got this game . i play this everyday
it worked when i got it 1st time but now it will not work . please fix this or people will delete it like i did just now .
if you played one temple run you played all of them . i do n't find the point of downloading this game if you already have temple run .
i am really enjoying this game ! puzzles you need to solve to be able to get out of a locked room . entertaining .
i did n't even play it yet . i think it will be fun though . all the apps that everyone rates are bad , i like .
dang . this is awesome ! i did all levels without even losing a life ! are any of you surprised ? you have to be surprised .
i 'm enjoying both the artwork and the game , though it 's not an entirely new format or story . still , it 's pretty and entertaining .
i love this game so much that i hope they make a second one . ive never been so addicted of playing a game .
i found this fun enough to get the full version . it 's a thinking game but i kind of lost interest after a while .
it 's a really cute game . that is all i really have to say about the game . this is a lot of fun and addicting .
this is very challenging and is detailed for bible readers it truly test your knowledge which is a great reminder of needing to read the word more . the app is very clear and free
way too slow earning swords to clear space very slow progress ! not much money or experience either ! and you ca n't play offline ! not one of my favorite games !
i want to delete it now but i cant because it isnt install now i cant install it thanks a lot dont get it
downloaded this app but did n't use it as much as a previous app . not saying it does n't work - was n't for me , i was too used to the other one .
great app and fast . easy to download . works on my kindle fire hd as good as using the computer . i recommend this , would get it again , and i hope this helps someone .
enjoy bingo games . this one is a little different but fun to play . have to pay attention to boards but worth it .
good challenges and a variety of choices of mental exercises . only reason it does not have 5 stars is the print was quite small in spots for my old eyes .
i loved this game on my phone , i 'm loving the kindle fire version . it 's easier to move my little people around . just wish there were ways to customize my little people before i play .
this app is awesome ! ! ! ! ! i can always have a gun war with my brother and its soooooooo much fun ! ! ! ! ! ! u should totally get it !
i have not yet played this game . i just got it and i plan to spend many good times playing it
another hit with this company . rovio keeps making these great fun games . i thought at first it would be the same , but oh no , totally new game and lots of fun !
great game so i went ahead and got the full version ! this is perfect for relaxing and killing time no matter what your doing . i really hope they make more games like this ! !
this is a cool game we play everyday . kids love this game just downloaded it on my moms tablet . got ta try it
it is ok for a quick look at the current weather . i 'm not sure i 'm using it correctly but that is all i can get out of it .
i was not happy with this game and actually removed it from my kindle . it seemed awkward to me when playing this particular angry birds game .
i tried to download from my computer to my kindle with no results . this looked interesting and disappointed i ca n't play it .
i removed this game from my kindle . it would never work even after removing and downloading it again . i can not say i would recommend this to anyone .
now i do n't have to hunt for other players to have a game . it 's a lot of fun for one .
not good and have removed it from my kindle after trying it several times .
if u remember this game from back in the day than u will enjoy playing it again take my word u will have fun
i have played this as a car d game for years , and now enjoy playing it on my kindle fire hd
challenging yet not too hard . great game to pass some time with , or get completely lost in ! i also love the fact you can play the same game on many devices .
this is a solid puzzler . the levels are challenging and highly entertaining . if i could give it 6 stars i would .
works great on my kindle fire hd . i love being able to record something on the fly without having to turn on the tv .
you pretty much know what to expect . works just fine on both cell phone ( htc sense ) and kindle fire . no issues whatsoever .
i like this time management game . it ` s not too fast or too stressful . it is a good game to play when you need a break or sitting in the waiting room .
great game . make more ! i ca n't stop playing this game . i would like a never ending game like this one . less searching and more hidden game though .
i try various apps on my new phone as i come across them to see if they actually work as advertised and something i find i need . this app is a pretty good one .
love the challenge of this game . you think you know these things but they are n't as easy as you 'd think . i also like that you can reset and play again .
this is a really awesome game ! it 's so cute and fun to play ! despite the occasional freezing , its extremely addictive ! ! ! ! i love it !
my daughter likes some of the silly choices available , but does n't have a lot of options . does n't see to keep her attention .
my family and i love to solve these puzzles together ... . my son loved the game so much that he download it on his phone !
my granddaughter plays it for a few minutes and then wants to play something else . she finds it too boring . so i am going to delete it off my kindle
i 'm addicted ! i ca n't stop playing this amazing game ! i would definitely recommend this game to anyone and everyone ! i really enjoy playing this game !
best bongo app i 've seen so far . you get coins every 4 hours and the numbers are called at good pace .
i like it it 's great for road trips and just to play its fun minigames and good points it 's fun for for all ages and a fun time . : - )
good game can be very challenging at times . the for words series odds fun overall . i def recommend this game
my friends thought that this was the funniest thing that they had ever seen they actually thought that i had an iphone . i loved this app .
i like this one . i do prefer the temple runner 2 because i feel like the characters for some reason in this one are more difficult to maneuver .
good ole angry birds its like a bag of chips u can never have just one got to have them i can never let this game down
it 's ok but when u click for a walk through , it does n't give it to you but its still ok
apparently , i 'm doing something wrong . i 'll keep trying though cause using this app would be quite benefit . i use yahoo daily .
i hate it . i ca n't make it even move , no instructions . take it off my kindle . please & thank you .
this is a lot like bejeweled and it is a lot of fun to play so if you are looking for fun game without killing or you just want to relax this is the game for you .
addicting game that 's tons of fun ! if you like playing zuma then this game is perfect for you ! it has tons of levels and great power ups !
great to have to find out all the who you need to know about the doctor . lots of features . go get it .
really helped me get ready for my trip ! hopefully i do n't forget anything due to this wonderful app ! i love you !
it is so fun to create different avatar 's i could play this game all day it is so fun to do it i love it
fun and easy to play . the ads are not intrusive and help keep the game free . great way to play with friends .
ok i think i 'm hooked at least on the graphics have n't played game long enough to say more but hey i love free stuff so what more can you ask for in a free app !
i love this game . i tried the play first version and could not get enough so i purchased the game .
alot of items can not be seen until you press that area . would not recommend to any one . needs better visual .
this game is very fun , but for some reason it always lock up when trying to go to the next level . i had to end up deleting it . overall , it is a fun game .
i 'm stuck on the same level . too hard at times , especially at this time . i get bored not being able to go forward .
its ok but i can tell what mood i 'm in better than it can like when i 'm happy it says i 'm sad you have to try multiple times to get it right
on the game it says to update the game then it just takes me to the app store and does nothing else except keep telling me i need an update ...
the thing that i do not like is that there is no channel 's in this one i want it to be like to be like the web .
it was horrible . it clicked all the time on my kindle fire . i wish i could give it less than 1 star , but ...
need to make it a little easier . gets so fast . other than that i love it . very fun game . ca n't wait to level up .
i think this game is so fun . the look of it is very pleasing , the controls are simple , it offers lots of different birds and pigs to use .
i enjoy this app . very challenging with great options to solve . lots of puzzles to choose . it can become very addicting for crossword fans .
it could be better i mean it 's amazing with the art work but not what i expected so with this game before u play expect the un expected ... ... ... ... ... .. and ya .
my daughter wanted to buy this and i should have read the reviews before i let her . it is okay , but not an actual game .
after i played it , i found it was dumb . so i deleted it what more can i say i did n't like it .
even though the app was free ; it did n't work , could not watch my movies on my kindle . not a good app .
it is a good game but after a while it wo n't let you get on and the ipad version is better
i play it a little . that 's all i have to say . that 's all i have to say . that 's all i have to say .
harder than i thought it would be . not the hangman i played in school . several categories of words are given .
i got to play one level and it kept force closing . it was fun until i could n't go any further what the heck ! ! !
great for getting into the christmas spirit ! if you like & # 34 ; hidden object & # 34 ; games , this one will not disappoint ! get it and be entertained . thank you .
if it does n't work on your kindle then do n't waste the bad reviews . minecraft is fun but wait till cheaper . do n't . get the free version it just like iphone one horrible .
it is a waste of time and it do n't even work i was angry and it said i was in love it is stupid do n't get it if you are smart
i love this app it 's great . however there are many times that the downloads fail and do n't finish . all together though , it is a great app .
interesting game . fast paced . good graphics . good plot . hidden objects not too difficult . what more can i say ? good game .
i have had trouble sleeping for the last few days and with this app it put me right to sleep ! it sounds like real rain outside my window
not that cool . three yr old likes it for a minute then gets bored . only one feature that shows dinosaur pic and tells u name . its alright enough though . its free ! ! !
seems ok so far , not too far into it yet , you have to pay for hints and tips though ... but the game is free
this game is perfect for my daughter to play and i get an enjoyment out of playing this awesome game it brings back childhood memories .
i like the story the graphics but not so much the puzzles . worth the half price . sometimes you have to tap several times to make the object stick . l like the hints .
funny game - this game is what you might want to do at work but ca n't . it 's a funny concept .
i got this as a free app of the day game and i loved it quick play through though . i love escape game and this is the best i found very recommended .
this is a nice game . it would get five stars if all the puzzles were free but at least you can get one new puzzle each day as well as every weekend .
i 'm a facebook addict and this app makes it easier to read than on my phone and easier to access than on my computer .
this was a fun game to play . i love mysteries and hidden object games and this offered both ! i ca n't . wait for part two !
i was n't sure what to expect at first but i was hooked from the start . fun game . husband and son are hooked to . gameloft has done it again . great game !
i play this game a lot and especially enjoy the levels where you challenge yourself to see how high you can build the burger . lots of fun !
i chose this app over several others . the graphics are bright and vibrant . it is user-friendly . being able to play with others online is a plus . great app !
my children watch this short movie . they always laugh whenever they see it . child humor ... comes with free app version . worth it , if you children like angry birds .
this game is fun and addictive . i play every day and night . i would suggest this game for anyone . i do wish you could get more daily coin .
its going good so far love it great great great emails service will keep it for a very long time
easy to learn , easy to play , and addictive . so worth the price of a free download . several characters , and boards to unlock . this will keep you entertained for hours .
really creative app . never played before , but i could start . my kids have a thing for this game . definitely child appropriate .
free app of the day and well worth downloading . excellent graphics and good gameplay . good for all ages and abilities .
my 4 yr old shows me the app everytime she figures out what each little picture does , she loves it .
i play this game every day . it is a lot of fun to play family members and friends . of course it helps that i am good at it ! ( :
you do n't do anything what so ever on this game it is so boring . not funny at all . do not get this app
boring and i could n't get into it . i do n't like it but you might . so try i just thought it was boring .
i enjoyed playing candy crush and i truly love this also . i like everything about it the daily prizes , and everything .
meh ... you can try if you want ... only one actual game.. gets boring . maybe you 'll like it ... i uninstalled in a week .
this game is fast paced and fun . i only wish there were more levels to play . worth the money i paid .
it is a ok game i like it but could make it more smooth i still like it my wife even plays and she hates games
i have n't exactly played it yet but i was just wondering if you have to have facebook to play this game because i do n't have facebook but this game looked really fun ... .
fun and challenging . my 9 and 11 year olds love it too , good for both adults and children , had a blast !
this game is so much fun to play i can & quot ; t put it down its hours of fun i am up until 2 in the morning playing .
this game is super fun and addictive it is great for me and kids of all ages and it is great for trips even little kids this great for them because it is fun and kid friendly .
this app was amazing i love all the very cool and popular icons ! ! i recomend this to anyone that has free time .
my 12 year old grandson loves this game . he is an avid hunter and i got this for him . the youngest one is trying it now .
nice little time waster . makes you use your brain to figure out all the different puzzles you are required to solve to get to the next level
awesome entertainment for hours . it is a very fun app and a great time waster . love it a lot amazing
this is a grate game kinda hard to control but you will get the hang of it after a little bit .
a very nice way to start the day . i look forward to this . god is good and his word is blessing to me .
it 's ok , but it 's kind of easy . i can usually figure out the puzzles in a few seconds
this is a fun game except it takes forever to build your money up . it would be better if it did n't take as long to add up . but it is addicting .
i love this game i played it before i 've been waiting forever to download on to kindle fire and here it is ! ! it 's so much fun !
great app ! love this app . really like the notifications of battery level . like knowing how much time i have left on different actions .
i really love the app . i 'm so into horoscopes . this way its right at my finger tips . i keep ot on my my screen at all times
tested it out and it works ! ! i have it on both my devices . i think it is the best mobile security i have ever used .
this is a great app for killing time . the time limit for getting your coins could be less but other than that i have no complaints
this is a dumb game . i could not find a challenge or any way to improve the game . ended up buying it in a attempt to get to pac-man .
good game , makes you think . so far so good , you earn coins to buy hints or extra levels . i have n't had to use any real money yet .
i love pinterest so much fun . you will love it , post stuff and get useful ideas and there is funny pictures to make you laugh you should get this app
i really enjoyed the story and gameplay . the cut scenes were first rate . nice break from the hidden item games .
i love this game because i play real bingo and you can play this along time without running out of tickets quickly
fantastic game but very addictive ca n't wait to play all the time and to meet new people good game well done
fun game , easy to play and keeps you on your toes . great for & # 34 ; challenging & # 34 ; my granddaughters while we are all on our kindles !
i went through it pretty quickly , but i really enjoyed it . great graphics and game play . the hint feature speeds through .
good game but kind of monotonous after a while . i enjoy it but i know after a few days it will get boring and repetitive .
what can i say . i like it . it 's simple , easy , and helps me get my math homework done a hell of a lot faster .
this allowed me to connect with our printer printer and print out anything i need to from my kindle fire . one of the best free apps i 've ever downloaded !
i was really enjoying this game until l could n't go to another level unless l bought tokens using my credit card .
this slot is slot of fun . real slot games from the casino . but better be ready to purchase coins if you want to keep playing . takes them pretty fast .
this is a new twist on solitaire , i love this game , even more than playing spider solitaire . this is a great game .
i do not get it even with the tutorial i think they should give it better instructions but it seems fun ! !
fun app to pass the time . makes you think . i can see how it can be very addicting . great price for an awesome
its strange cu 's just yesterday i was thinking i really want temple run 4 my kindle so now i have it and its the best game ever !
i love this game ! i can choose to play one of my friends , or i can play a random opponent . either way , there are hours of entertainment with this game !
i unfortunately can not rate this app due to the fact you need the disney channel to use this app
i use this app to watch all of my favorite cw shows when i miss them on tv . works like a charm but the commercial breaks can be annoying .
i agree with all the comments about app ... please fix the problem ... so frustrating to almost finish but ca n't ... otherwise good app .
the graphics in this game are very good . the only thing i feel like that it 's too easy . wish it was more of a challenge .
when i looked at this app i thought it was boring and i installed it and turns out i really like it i cant stop playing
this game is good great for all of these people were having fun with the best possible games free for all your fan 's
love this game . it is so fun . i would recommend this game to anyone who has free time . not all is easy but most is
i like to play this game when i have some free time or am bored . . . . . .
easy , fun and a good way to pass time . works well for kindle fire . i recommend this game for whenever you need something fun to do for a while .
i 'm . really enjoying this game . nice graphics etc . i wish it had a zoom feature that would make it perfect !
i am having a great time playing this game . much better than floors . i love games that challenge my brain .
downloaded this app for kindle hd and it keeps freezing up on me . may be a good game , just do n't know .
this is an awesome good and super fun game to play ! i love it so very much if i were you i would get it ! !
it is fun and challenging . i found most objects but really had to search for some . would recommend it for all ages .
my daughter likes this game but got bored fast ! should have more things to do ! good idea though ! i like that it encourages care for animals .
i hope they come out with more levels for this game . i was sad when i finished it . kept me hooked for sure ! ! !
this game 's graphics are horrible and at first i was n't able to open it . but then when i did it was n't worth it
i had heard a lot of talk about this game but i did n't think i 'd enjoy it as much as i am . it truly is addictive !
its possible that i did n't just get the game , but it last like 3 minutes and all you do is crush bugs with your finger so unless there is another point i do n't recommend this game
sometimes it lags but it is a fun an addictive game . i really like to play the slots i think u should add more
it 's just like flappy bird it 's so much fun ... the game is a little challenging but i like challenge so if your like that this games for you : )
i am really enjoying playing at this site . it is a lot of fun and almost as good as the real thing
i 've had no issues with this game . it 's fun to play to pass time if you have it to waste . not awesome but not bad either .
the kids love . the loves it . the graphics are pretty good . what else can i say . i recommended you give it a try .
not to pleased with losing all progress due to an update . the game was great , but i wo n't be playing anymore after this .
very addicting game , the card at its some of the best , easy to learn and great set up for the action .
i freaking love this app ! there is nothing that i dont like about this app it 's all good . it 's so funny i use the music of the app to fall asleep lol .
i think this game is one of the best games i have played . i did not find one problem with this game
i love this game , great game so basic but so much fun . i love the speed and very easy to learn to play .
very fast action just like you are at the casino ... you win and lose big ! lot 's of fun you do n't realize how much time flies by .
it was hard to steer , and i wish i could control the speed somewhat . then it was just boring . i stopped playing the first day .
solutions are not unique . puzzles too simple . developer spent little or no time creating individual puzzles . also , colors used not appropriate for color blind users .
perfect for children its graphics are amazing my daughter now wants a pony for christmas . i love how they give you real activities you must do to care for a horse
did n't like this one all that much , love pinball , but did n't enjoy this at all , which is bad , because i was hoping it would be better .
this app works well and has n't caused a crash yet , i like as does my wife . i would get it again .
good graphics but the game cost too much for so short of a game . disappointed that it was so short . not enough for the money .
it is a super game to play . it is real hard to put down . i would recommend it to anyone who enjoys puzzles .
it fun to look up stuff but it really did n't have that much , i was looking up one thing and it took somewhere different so not that helpful just got it for fun any way .
i thought this was a kindle game bought it than could not download a little angry i purchase this one no recommendation didnt get to play
i thought this was something else . not for me ... . maybe a better understanding of the game was needed before i purchased it .
... since it was the free app of the day and i love it ! ! especially the list feature ! definitely highly recommended !
my husband and i travel often , i make sure i read the bible daily . i have this bible on my ipad and my galaxy 4. i have god 's words with me always . thank you !
there are so many games to choose from in this game , and i do n't see how anyone could ever get bored with it .
i am not a big fan of this app for the kindle fire hd . it seems lacking and slow in services . i do n't even use it .
i wanted an app that would allow me to find my kindle files . this does what it is supposed to do .
i think this is a nice way to relax . nothing exciting , but enjoyable . i would recommend this if you want to play but not concentrate .
so far so good , just wish the price was n't so high maybe soon they could make a full length game for free , i love all their games but would be broke buying everyone
this is a fun game . if you don , t play for awhile it uninstalled and you lose your coins . if this could be fixed it would be a five star game .
nice to be able to check facebook while at work or on the road . same features as the computer program .
fun and real life like but it takes forever to get any where in the game you literally have to buy into it to progress and get money to fix the house and stuff
this is a great game ... ... ... ... please keep this updated . it 's terrific for idle time & i love it . keep these games coming !
this game is great fun and it is perfect for all ages . in fact i might even say it is better for kids .
this game is great . it is so much fun to play . in fact it is very hard not to play it all the time .
fun to play when passing time or waiting for something . simple to play and it is free . the ads are easy to skip . get it .
fun , addicting . sometimes the ball does n't go where you want it to . otherwise its good . kindle fire compatible . play it all the time on mine .
works quickly and has a fairly good interface . the only problem i have is sometimes the controls freeze when in map mode , otherwise works well .
every game i play i get down to the last two word and get stuck , i ca n't figure out ho to reset them .
i love pandora . even with the ads its great and so many channels it allows you to make and keep . wonderful app and one of my favorites .
i like this game but unfortunately i do n't get the best results . i can play a long time just on luck .
this form of solitaire is both challenging and straight forward . i 'm glad it comes with instructions and an easy win choice .
my husband took this and did all the puzzles in less than 30 min . i like the pictures of the flowers but not the square format .
who does n't love zombies and killing zombies ? ! well it is a heck of a lot more fun when you get to do it with cute little plants .
i enjoy this game , however i keep having to reset it and reinstall it it 's just not reliable ... i hope they fix it
i love this app because it is addicting and i can never stop playing it ! it good for all ages and free and easy ! this is a game everyone should enjoy !
this is the same as temple run 2 - my granddaughter plays it and says it is ok. i have not played this game .
i love anything that has to do with food network , it makes my life more complete ! love the recipes , it makes for a good dinner every once in a while .
this app is so cool . i can barely get off it . do n't pay attention to all the bad reviews ; they 're mental .
i love anything that has to do with words . it is very engaging and i love it . i will definitely recommend this to everyone .
got this to help my little one learn how to count she loves it and plays with it every day
it was a fun game when i first bought it but very quickly it became boring . graphics are not that great .
this game is cool i love it some of them get hard but nothing you ca n't figure out just takes some creative thinking
great to have this available to check on my mail and contact with friends while traveling in area with wifi ... wish it was more like cell phone to get to web etc .
this app is great . i love watching old movies so this is right for me . so easy to use . and the selections are great .
it is a really fun game but is sometimes to understand what the next step requires . i eventually figured out as i went .
decent graphics and movement . difficulty level is appropriate and most puzzles can be solved . i enjoy playing this each evening .
great , fun game that involves strategy and a lot of thinking to solve each puzzle . it is a good challenge .
i had a lot of fun doing this game . there were lots of great activities . the interactive play was really quite good .
i 'm addicted ! love this game ! the more you play this game the easier it becomes , but each level is more challenging .
this is a really good app to help to learn to draw games well , celebrities . this is also a really fun app . i love this app .
not quite sure how all the aspects of the game work yet , but , so far it 's fun . we will see how much better or worse it gets as the game progresses .
the other checkers are stupid and boring but this one is actually normal . go ahead and download it its the best one yet
it is very challenging ! it takes a while to get through all the islands and each is so different . i love it !
i love this app i play it during church all the time and its a great time passer where ever you are or how old you are its just awesome
good concept , but the artwork for the objects is rather confusing . once you figure out what things are , it 's a rather fun little game . got it free so no complaints about the price .
this is a great game that keeps my partner and i entertained for a while . my children even like to help clear the blocks and guess the picture .
i do n't like that when you get stuck you are kinda out of options besides asking facebook but other than that it 's ok
this is a really fun game and i was surprised at the bonuses . the extra bingo cards help alot ! we need more games similar
it 's ok i guess but i really would n't know because you do n't even get to play the game before they ask you to rate therefore i only gave 2 stars
great app and so nice to use when reading on my tablet . thanks amazon for a great free app of the day !
i really really love this game but it is very addictive . i 've been on it over 2 hours now and ca n't put it down ! ! : )
i think this app is great it is so addicting and so fun . great app i love it get it
this is very entertaining . i love it . it is awesome . who is awesome ? this game right here . i love it . did i already said it ? whatever . buy this app .
i 'm not sure if this game has harder levels or not but the levels i 've played are impossible to lose . not much challenge really .
the best game ever and i play it about three or four times a day . it is easy to use
i enjoy this game when i am bored . it is entertaining and fun . love the power plays and it is not hard to collect .
pay close attention . be careful how you spend . all in all just another rpg . it wont bore you but it wont thrill ya either
this game is not angry birds , but it is awesome in its own right . its a very addicting and very fun game !
this game is so boring it is just not for me i give it a 2 star rank on my opinion
i found that this application was just ok. it provides the basics , and that is fine . i would like to see some improvements
everything that was fun about temple run but with more variety . more level variety , more power ups , more fun ! perfect kind of game for when you want to kill a few minutes , or hours .
i think it would be a little better if you could at least enter the houses . there could be a couple battles in each . or items .
i love the graphics . their amazing ! ! and since i love temple run or games related to it i knew this game would be perfect for me and it will be perfect for you too !
this app uses alot of my battery . but it is reliable . i use it all of the time . it 's loaded on a kindle hd .
i love this game i play it a lot it keeps me on my toes and fast action i love
the game wont play properly . i make a move and it never shows the other players move . glad i didnt have to pay for this
my son loves to just sit and have the app read this book to him ! i really like the fact that he has the choice to read it by himself !
i still have to learn more on it it is hard to understand i am very new at games so i need more time
its a fun game but i do n't like having to wait so long for things to finish unless i spend my own money . that 's why i left off 1 star .
this game is much more fun than it looks to be . typical mario clone type game but works very well on nexus 4 phone .
good game that makes you think but is n't so difficult to get frustrating . i found the concept interesting and entertaining .
it gets your brain thinking and exercises it . it 's fun trying to figure out the pictures and match the letters to the scene .
builds good problem solving skills . my 8 year old likes it as much as i do . works great on droid 2 .
i like that this game has auto click , and auto finish . it makes it much easier to play than other free games that make you drag each card .
this game is great for people who like challenges . you have to go through many different rooms trying to find a way out of the ship .
thanks to the developer for fixing the word list to show again . i enjoy playing this game , and requiring the letter in the center to be part of the words can be challenging at times !
some of the games are lame . but some are pretty addictive ... worth it for being free . better than most free games : )
i thought it would be fun to play a clue game for once in a long time since my childhood
oh this one is easy . who does not like angry birds ? now the pigs they are not so nice . i thoroughly enjoy this game . the seasons give you something cute to look at too .
my grand daughters love this game so much . they play it every time they come over . i highly recommend it .
unless you want to use your money to advance in game it is very slow moving forward , with some quests pretty much impossible otherwise good to help pass the time .
guess i 'm not very good at this . it did n't hold my interest and was bored with this game . not good at the slots in the casinos either .
it wo n't let me sync with facebook from my kindle . love the game from my laptop . help developers ! i want to spin .
where 's my water ? is beyond fun ! it is the best game in the world ! you can play this game for hours ! the controls are very easy to work . a must buy app !
get bored sometimes at work , and at home . love it ! comes in handy for young children also when they get bored .
this was a fun game did n't have to think very hard , so it was a fun time waster when bored with tv .
i love this game it has all of the robots in the movie and also they put in other robots to fight
works great on the kindle . it 's addictive and fun ! i 've played it through a few times and still find it to be my favorite time waster .
works like a dream ! does everything i needed and more ! keeps everyone in the family organized and informed . even syncs with my kids school calendar so i do n't forget when school is out .
great game and lots of fun . would recommend to anybody who loves to play the slots . great graphics . very addicting .
this seems to be a lot of fun . takes time to figure out the answer . can get the help needed from friends
boring ! i guess if you do n't have any other games to play - but i ca n't imagine that . it 's just boring .
an ok little app . works fine on droid x. it is simple , but interesting . it is a good time killer . good for kids . score history would be nice .
this game was n't a challenge at all . it was boring and did n't have anything interesting going for it . do n't play !
i have been unable to download it and am a bit frustrated . oh well , it was free and maybe it will work later on , , , ,
i got this app on my phone there were so awesome i love it . i can play it all day
i 've never played quell before and now i 'm addicted ! ! simple and easy to learn . the graphics look great on the kindle .
gets a little more difficult at each level . found out i needed a pen and paper at some levels but then again i 'm older than most of you .
it is entertaining and my grandaughter loves looking for the objects and the picture in general , would get other games like this
i play this every night before bed . pretty cool game figuring out the angles to kill the zombies and lots of screens .
so addicting ! ! love that you can share the puzzles you get stuck on to facebook for help ! ! love this app ... even paid for it to support the makers ! great job guys ! ! !
this helps with problems that you have during the game , you need a good memory or write the answer down for the problem when you ready to go back into the game .
i love this game there are so many levels , it is very challenging . i get to play all night long . great for anyone who loves matching .
this is okay , more fun probably for kids . not sure if i 'll actually play it much myself so i 'll just rate it as & # 34 ; okay & # 34 ; .
the video looks so cool i want it so badly i wish it was free or at least a dollar only
this game is very good . however challenging it may be , i enjoy playing this game . i would recommend this game to others .
what happened ? did you stop updating or what ? ? ? ? would like to continue , see where it ends . please update , so i can finish the game , if there is an end .
this game is somewhat of a challenge for anyone who has not done a lot of these type games . takes a while to get the hang of it .
it 's not my favorite game but i like it ok idk it 's a little boring to me i play it but
i just started playing and already its pretty scary . i love the mix of puzzles too . the length also is appreciated : )
so far this game has been fun and the and i like the story line and is easy to play .
one really fun and challenging puzzle game ! definitely worth $ 1 ! better than most puzzle games out there ! : ) most amazing puzzle game !
this will be a good way to clean out the bugs in my kindle . i think i will get the app right now it seems interesting .
this app is really fun but it started to slow down and my kindle would n't turn on a few times other than that it was really fun . and u should get it
this game is just like doodle jump but somehow the bottom of the screen is solid so you can never lose
best app ever that the only thing in can say like seriously . by the way the there 's a big boss at level 20
this sounds like a terrible game nice title but it sounds like it sucks so i am not getting it .
app says it 's for free but it really is n't . you have to pay it for each magazine . do n't recommend download it .
this game is much like the game clue . it takes you from one level to another . i would recommend this application to everyone who has a kindle .
this is a fun game . great pastime . challenging and fun . play for yourself and find out . any age will enjoy playing this game .
i happened to buy this app the day it was free , so , it 's worth more than what i payed for . is it worth $ 15 , heck no .
i love the speed of this game and the different cities and i love how you can use the money you earn for power ups .
it is challenging but fun too i got addicted fast but i wish you had a little more help or the song was longer
it is so cool i love it a lot so you play it it is so cool love it love it
i love this app ! it also works without wifi ! it 's fun if your bored and its not hard to get new characters and coins ! great app ! download !
this is a awesome game because i feel like it is a learning game and i love to learn at school and at home .
i just do n't spend as much time with this as i should . if the weather would get bad i might stay in side & work with it more .
crashes on nexus s 4g . shame , i got through a few pages and it seemed nice . it would be good if the description said that this is designed for a tablet
great - it is challenging and that keeps my brain active , sort of like games make to stimulate and keep mind active .
good job on this app , its worth the money , strong features and hd , i dont know why some gave this app a 3 or lower , i give it a 5 out of 5
good waste of time if i had to pay would not bother pretty much what it sounds like with a few cute features
its a good game . its a little challenging at times but its not too hard . i wish it was easier to get free hints though . : - )
i really like the game i just wish it had more story lines in it . i also wish kindle had the same version as the android market .
fun time killer . i 've only played single player mode , but is easy to learn and controls are straight forward and shooting up the other cars is a great stress reliever .
this game just did n't do it for me . i could n't seem to get it going right , though they said it was easy .
overall quite fun . i wish energy came back sooner and you did have to pay so much for the extra items .
i really like it but i think you should start off with more money and i think that they have too many buttons
i am a beginner . this was supposed to help beginners . didnt make sense at all . very hard to use . deleted it .
best sudoku i have played . though the backgrounds could be improved , the game itself is excellent ! ! ! i highly recommend this to beginners , novice , and advanced players .
i used to play this game when it was on ios but gave it up when i gave up my ipod , so now i 'm so glad it 's finally on android !
i cant believe that after this long i can finally get temple run on my kindle it is so great i am so happy
i 've gotten pretty addicted to this game , but it can get pretty tough without higher level cards that you have to buy
my 11 year old daughter got this game for her kindle fire . it is basically a game for very young children .
this game is a lot of fun . if you like bingo this is the game for you . i highly recommend this game .

it 's fun to play with family and friends . simple to follow , can move along as quickly as you would like to
this is great i love it .it has all my favorite shows from when i was a kid its great for my kindle fire .
i get tired of games really easily but this one i never get tired and it is way more fun than angry birds
it 's a fun game and instead of needing energy you need food to complete actions which i think is a much better system
this is definitely entertaining , and sometimes frustrating . the dialogue is awful , but sometimes you have to listen to it all for clues , so do n't skip it . worth the download .
this game of draw something is a lot of fun , my kids like to play it over and over again
this game is just like flappy wings it still is fun but a little bit harder so try it you will like it
just played it for a while and its fun . can get addicting cause i keep wanting to catch more fish .
too cool ... i could play this constantly . more of a challenge than i thought it would be at the beginning .
this game is awesome but i do n't like how ya have to purchase coins to buy stuff but its . funny
i feel that there was not enough explanation on how to play this game . therefore , i deleted it from my device .
i like the way the colors show you the words you 've found , as well as how they show in the list .
have so much fun same as one on face book , then works same , make your comics of your self and friend are so on lots of fun ! !

for very young kids . not adult game . to few of the seek items on each screen . would never have bought if i had listened to the other people 's feedback . will from now own .

i wish things could be better than what is comes out of it needs to be better for child to use
i just love the weatherbug . love how it tells you what the weather is in your area and gives up to 7 days of forecast
not bad , not outstanding . it gets several headlines on the screen for a quick look , but browsing when you have time is not so easy .
i really enjoy this game . the games have free spins and sometimes bonuses . colors are great and characters are great .
i love this game and play it as often as i can since i work all day
nice game . good challenges . do hope it gets a bit more difficult as the game progresses . at the moment a tad too easy .
it was free , so that makes it even funner . yes , i know funner is not a word . i am not an idiot .
take about addicting i like the the fact that u can see how far your friends are . wish it had more life 's but then i would be to easy .
it always crashes and never lets me post . i ca n't believe i even tried this again , such a waste of time .
this game . was a little too dark for me . i could not keep my attention for any long periods of time .

very easy to use and nice to have a calculator so handy . having it on my kindle for easy access is great .
idk about this game . it is ok but it does n't hit that very very fun mark . i do n't think so anyway . it was short and boring
i downloaded this to pass time . it turns out to be a pretty good app . highly recommend . if you enjoy slots
challenging and a fun concentration game . lots of fun to play ! i personally love word games anyway . hours of fun .
this book is n't very good . the quotes are nothing you 've not seen or heard before . i love great quotes so i may not be the best to give a good rating .
this was very frustrating for my child as there was nothing telling him anything about what was needed . he lost interest and he loves problem saving , but this gave him no hint to what the problem was .

awesome game . my only issue is that for me ... the clue doesnt always match the movie . but all in all , it is an amazing game .

this is one of the best games out there . i would play this all day if i had no school . lol

works perfectly on my kindle fire . easy to play and it fun . i played for about 10 minutes after i got this app . love it !
this game is fun to play with . it 's like you have your own little fish to breed , buy , and take care of .
my favorite android chess . fits well on my phone and tablet screen . they make great apps that work well . even their free versions are very nice with adds that do not distract too much .
this game is really fun and it really makes you think thank you i would like to see more fun stuff like this
this game is cute and fun , but there 's not much of a challenge . maybe my two and almost four year old nephews would like it .
this game is amazing . it is fast paced challenging and you can play with your friends . this game works on kindle fire .
this alarm clock does not word for me , i would not tell a friend , does n't work for me , complicated , would not choose it again
i loved it still enjoying it today . nice sequel . would recommend to all . it 's a must have
like angry birds . i shared it with my grandkids and they loved it . they are better at it then me .
this app is very helpful for minecraft ... it has everything you need ... i have a huge diamond block house and i have a huge gold house right next to it ... definitely would recommend this app
i just wanted to keep busy for as few minutes , but kept playing round after round . good for keeping your mind active .
this is such a great game ! it 's so much fun ! you can play the game without purchasing anything if you are patient .
did n't work for me . you pop one bubble and the app messes up . do n't waste your time . i was going to get this for my 2 yo . glad i tried it before him !
love how fast this app is on my kindle ! can jump between accounts quickly if you have more than one . try it you wont be disappointed !
description says it is compatible with kindle fire hd when it in fact is not . please fix this so that i can get it on my kindle fire hd .
ca n't always get to my desktop so i 'm glad this app is available for kindle fire hd also works well with my android .
really gets to be a challenge and makes me want to do the next level before i stop playing for the day
almost 5 just not quite there if they added more moves and characters it be great overall solid game i am not in love bit i am definitely satisfied
this was not for kids and was not good unless you wanted to check out the sounds and looks of guns
this would be a great game if it all worked . the bonus games do not work . the balls are not added every 30 seconds .
this is a pretty fun game its not one of the best but its ok would be good for younger kids
this app is one of the best apps for the kindle . i loved it so much ... it was money well spent .
not as good as some games , but does play well . i would recommend to anyone who just wants something to do .
fun and challenging . good to pass the time . better on larger screens . i need this for my kindle . fun to use .
stupid game , not worth your time or the memory on your phone . i do n't even use it . deleted it shortly after purchased
this is an entertaining game . i like the challenge and seeing how i rank against others . sometimes i wish it would give you a little more time to make words though but still a great game .
this is a highly addictive little game . it has a nice balance of strategy and luck . fun to come back to if you want to waste time .
i like the pet rescue saga . it is easy , but yet difficult at times . great for kids . i do recommend this game .
this is mostly for children . i do n't care for it . maybe someone could come up with harder tiles with letters and game symbols .
this is a good app if you like logo games . it makes it kind of easier by giving you letters to choose from . just buy the app and see !
this is my very favorite game . it would be a lot dinner if the weapons were cheaper or we earned more money . but otherwise it 's very fun
my daughter loves this ( she is 3 ) . she is learning though she does n't know it . i like that there are different learning areas .
i personally like traditional art and i suck at digital but with app what i draw actually looks pretty good . i would recommend to anyone ! : )
if you look at the permissions , you will see that this app is able to access your exact location using wifi and gps ... why does a flashlight need to do this ?
i did n't play it . this was chosen by a small child . she did n't quite understand it . i did n't take the time to check it out . no comment one way or the other
haha this game is awesome i have been waiting forever for this and it has finally came out i 'm so happy
i couldnt open this program . so it may be good but i dont know . is there a way to see before i down load ?
it is okay , not for me really , and do n't like the slots they have , maybe will be better when i play it more
fun to play when you are stuck at the dr office with your kid . need five more words to be done .

this is good very busy and a lot of our business is done through mail so i never get behind
it was not what i was looking for so i really did n't use this app . might have been a good app , just was n't what i was wanting
this app has a lot of fun and very interesting games on it and i thought it was the most fun i have had .

i especially like that you just have to touch a card to move it unlike the other solitaire game i have on my kindle also from amazon .
i was really happy to see that this game was finally on kindle . this game is fun and addictive ! you wo n't be able to put it down !
this game is great i played some zombie game on an iphone similar to this but this game is much funner i got it for my kindle fire its funny too everyone should get this game
the game is addicting but it stopped loading on my kindle and takes up too much space on my phone to download .
decent game so far as i can tell . i am not impressed with the fact that you have to pay after ten doors .
too many reminders on main page . do not have facebook so cant get hearts . need more land more quickly . cant find scratch in my village .
i love minecraft . my friend got me interested and i got it for the xbox 360 , one of the first apps i asked for as soon as i got my hd .
son is having a blast . there are some parts that are frustrating but as games go it is fun to play . wish that had a beginner / easy selection .
i was hoping to find some sort of norton protection for my kindle fire and was thrilled when a friend told me about this .
never heard of some of the companies . and spelling counts which makes it a bit harder but i like it ok .
i loved this at first until i had to spend real money to advance into the fun stuff . i get why games do that i guess but maybe an option to earn stuff would be great ?
this is a good version of mahjong , it has numerous layouts to choose from . the only thing that i had a hard time with was telling which tiles were free to move .
this is a great app to have , always available at your fingertips to watch whatever you like when you want to watch . so glad i was able to install this app .
this is a fun little game to have to pass the time . there are cool things to do and it is educational in some aspects .
does a great job . so happy to have it on all kindles . ever one should have one on all their kindles .
i did n't like this app at all . i even think i paid for it . it was confusing to use and i felt like i was getting second rate news .
this is more like what i was looking for to take notes at meetings and a bit hard to get used to .
not my favorite slot game but its good to pass the time . need more points like every slot game . end
what a awesome app this is a cool an fun game it 's like going to the arcade . everyone should play this game .
this seems like a fun game just wish it would load a little faster but still fun thats why i gave it a 4 enjoyed it
right from the beginning i did n't like it . it was boring and i could n't get mind into it.i had to quit .
enjoy the slot games ! like that there are so many different slot games to choose from . payouts are good and there is an hourly bonus to help keep you going !
i love this app it makes possible for two of my other apps to word flawlessly . trouble without it . thanks .
i bought this for free before , but now its .99 cents ! ! ! other than that , its pretty cool , except for controls

i 've played this card game when i was young . it is still as much fun as i remember . try this fun game . i 'm sure it will be addictive once you give it a try .

i have been waiting for this game for forever ! it has for so long only been on apple and android products . i love this game so much ! great fun easy for all ages ! : - )
neat way to keep track of your battery status . have n't had any problems with it on my kindle fire . fun to play with .
i love thus app because there is different difficulty levels . the categories are great and its always a challenge ! great for all ages ! ; )
its time consuming . i get addicted because it 's fun . there is n't much too it and it 's easy to learn how to play .
i was not a big fan of this as it did n't meet all of my needs and was n't as user friendly as i would have liked .
i was so excited to see this app finally free but it was to short i finished it in 30 mins ... fun but short
i was n't sure if i would enjoy it but i soon discovered that it was different than any other game that i had downloaded .
very addicting game , very easy to play and smooth ! i have n't found any problems at all ... . hopefully it will stay that way .
i watch animal planet all the time and this will be great for when the power goes out or we are just waiting for more things to happen
after seeing the cute picture , i downloaded the game . i was disappointed . the game was confusing . i probably wo n't continue to play it .

i find this app to be extremely accurate and i recommend it to everyone this is the best app ever !
just could n't get into the game . just not my kind of game to begin with . do n't know what else i can say .
fun to play in free time . get it i mean its free why not ? ! ? ! the only downside is that you need wifi to play it but its great and a fun game to play !
i love this app ! it is addictive and fun , but it also has different ways that you can play . i like the training option , but also the one where you play for chips .
wonderful way to pass the time . and an easy way to learn new words as well . loads quickly . never had a glitches with this one . highly recommend this one . )
this is a nice application however the interface could use a bit more work . i prefer the website or the iphone app .
great game . graphics are good , sound is kind of cheesy , and the game party is awesome . great start to a good game .
the because i like trying to solve puzzles and how to get out of the game it is hard and easy
this is a challenging game after the first levels . do n't use up your hints ! they are hard to get as you reach higher levels .
this app kept locking up on my tablet and phone . when it did work i liked it , but it caused more problems than it helped .
i think this game is awesome ! ! ! it 's really fun to play and very cute . i would recommend this to anyone who likes fun games
i really love this game it has such beautiful graphics keeps you very busy once you start playing you do n't want to put it . down

son got this game but he and i really do not like it at all . reaction time with the game is slow .
i liked it . its challenging but not too tough . kept me busy for awhile . not bad for an escape game .
this is ok. same as all the others like this , nothing really pops out that makes me say it 's better than any other similar app . go ahead and take a look .
netflix at your fingertips , how nice is that . this app makes it easy to watch netflix from your phone or tablet .
the game is fun addicting and challenging . even when you reach the finish , you can keep playing for the highest tile .
it is a trivia game and it is really fun i think you might need a brain to do this
very fun hide and seek game . i do recommend this one to all android users . being free app makes it that much more appealing .
ice age is a color full fun enjoyable game that you can play totally free if you have the patience to wait for your acorns to accumulate or if you prefer you can purchase . them for fast building .
this game is way better then temple run . i just love this game ! who would n't love it . every body should
i don not use this ap . too much trouble . i thought it would be handy . but paper and pencil works best for me .
i enjoy the hidden object games and this one for the tablet is really nice and i liked it a lot .
this is entertaining . not difficult at all . nice to pass time with when waiting for an appointment or other such event .
like the idea , but when i get to one i do n't know or ca n't solve , it stops me there and wo n't let me go on . very frustrating .
enjoyed it very much , had some problems seeing the items but that made it more of a challenge and that 's what i liked .
i could play this game all day if it was only possible . i have so much fun playing it that it is the first thing that i do once that i have all of my other work done .
super simple . i wish i could make list in side of list , but it does n't allow you to do so . works for simple grocery list , but i 'm better with pencil and paper ... .
this is an interesting game and i like it but i do n't understand it that well . i would recommend to give it a try
the carnival game i enjoyed as a child is now on my tablet . it is great fun and helps with my hand and eye coordination .
just because candy is in the name does not mean it is like candy crush saga . this is nothing like that game .
i have only used the app for a day and it seems like a good application . i only wish my community had more local ads on the app .
it is a good game . just make sure you think ahead as far as moves and how much time you have to play . you will forget about time
this word search is suitable for casual or more challenging use . letters are easy to read and time length given is fair . most enjoyable of recent similar apps .

really great game . well worth the price . cute character . i did find it was easier to play if i used a stylus .
i did not care for this game at all . it seemed very childish to me . do n't buy this one . that 's just my opinion ! ,
this game is fun and the new layout is awesome . very fun and entertaining . anyone who likes sudoku will like this version .

i love it a lot ! i love to draw so this is a good way to do it on my kindle .
great game . love i can start over if i want to . was a little hard to get started at first but became addictive fast .
this app is not bad or anything it 's just that you do n't need this app . i mean you can just go to silk and search it there . thats all .
this game was a lot of fun . i love hidden object games . the scenes and picture quality are wonderful . big fish makes high quality games , reasonably price . i highly recommend there games .
its ok but it would be better if there were more ways to get coins and the hints were more specific
wish i was better at drawing . and wish more of my friends played this game . oh well , it was fun when everyone was playing .
this app helps me talk to any of my friends anywhere i want to ... ... ..i love this app so much ! ! ! ! ! x x
love this game . very mind challenging . love that it gets harder each level . still easy enough for kids to use as well .
like this as it is relaxing and also allows you to use your mind . easy and fun . would reccomend this to anyone who loves to do puzzles ! fun and challenging .
this could be a good game if you were given some directions but without hints you ca n't figure out what is next . not even good as a free game .
but when it uses the flash from my camera , i would n't call it tiny ! ! it 's the only flashlight app i 've ever been impressed by . definitely a keeper ! ! !
this is one of the games that i play the most . it is very entertaining and will keep your attention for quite awhile .
i love this app . it syncs with google for me . i like that i can choose which calendar to have events show up on .
please update ! but great game ! buy it its will never end ! addictive and awesome fun for it children also great price ! ! ! !
omg i luv this game ! ! ! best game ever . but i hate when i run out of coins . my question is how do u get the gems for free ( without paying for them ? )
this game is a great game and i love playing it all the time . having this game is great when i 'm going somewhere since i can just upgrade something and go to the place .
just like on the big machines , you 'll find this does what it 's supposed to do , and does it well . no complaints here .
alot of fun ! really love the designs and creativity put into the game play . challenging and could be played by any age .
i enjoyed playing this app . the random puzzles make you think which makes this app game better than a regular seek and find .
a great way to challenge yourself and waste some time . sometimes frustrating but always enjoyable . i would recommend this game to my friends
way more easier then others and i found it fun for me and a bit almost funny can i say i laughed at my self
it is not a complicated game , but it can be challenging enough at any level . i is a great way to sharpen your brain .
would give it a 5 but some of the food takes to long . love the game and the concept get it !
i 've become addicted to it as much as candy crush . i ca n't stop myself from playing it . yes i have become one of those people i thought i 'd never be .
i am addicted . i can set and look for hours . there are so many great ideas on here . i just need to find enough time to try them all .
the game is excellent in providing many hours of fun and enjoyment for either multiple people or a single player . this helps to develop more word power .
fun , entertaining , and great play time ! ! ! ! ! try it out and you wo n't be able to put it down : ) good graphics and interesting quests .
great fun and the quick video for free points is nice . new gamers can learn quickly . highly enjoyable ! the graphics are great and there are many levels of play .

solitaire has always been a great way to pass the time . this is a great app . great way to get your mind off other things .
quick and easy access to well chosen verses . very convenient . would like to see verses in new american standard version .
love this game , just wish you could level up quicker . love the mini game . i will keep this on my device for a long time .
i would n't say it is as good as the original but it is great it is like 3d and i love the games it has they are awesome
i think if they would have put mobs ( like animals or monsters ) in it that would have made it better .
great game . not as great as the original flappy bird , but is pretty good . great game , i definitely recommend it .
everyone should play this game ! i have played other bingo games and this one is the best by far ! you will love it ! !
this game is fun . and i think it 's cool that they added new things to this game . i want to play this game all day
a very handy app . multiple items in on app , takes up less space on desktop . very useful , glad i got it .

awesome app i love it so much it is so awesomely awesomeness and the great app is awesome happened to play app
love this game . it plays easily and its not heard to learn . it has no glitches . the only bad thing is its highly addictive .
i played this game a lot when i got it . now i play other mahjong games but i still come back to this one .
i do n't usually review , but this game was pretty cool and said i should . overall i was satisfied and this game was something to do when i 'm bored .
i had a hard time at this and it was real brain teaser . need to have patience and time to complete the levels .
this app is so sick , been playing for five minutes and have been loving it . reccomended to anyone who likes guns
it works well on the kindle but i would recommend a separate keyboard to make it easy to type documents .
i have a 3 year old grandson who loves to play this game . i like the game but have not had a chance to play it .
reminds me of the old atari system . that kinda tells my age . have n't played much but it is fun . works well on kindle fire .
i liked the first where 's my water better . this one had too many additions , like special tools . i guess i just do n't like change .
once i got to a certain level and i cant get past it but it 's a cute game to play
i saw my brother playing it so i wanted to try it but it would not download plz fix this bug asap ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
i can finally text my friends . we are working on a project so it comes in handy . get this app !
this is a great game , enough going on to keep your interest and nice graphics . i have had no problems with it either .
i used to not be able to play the game at all , force closing frequently . the latest update fixed this problem along with changing the physics . major improvement .
this is a great game and lots of fun . it challenging enough to keep your interest yet not too challenging to cause frustration .
people are saying that you cant update this app but just uninstall it and reinstall it and it works perfect .
i would like to thank the creators for making this fun and challenging game . i completely recommend this addicting game . download this .
this game is challenging and fun . the graphics are pretty good . i do wish there was a way to earn free hints during game play .
must have this app . once i started playing it i ca n't stop . would recommend this app to everybody it is fun
very addicting and fun ! i have n't been able to put it down ! i have to fight my son for it ! kidding ! definitely a thinking game .
its a great game its easy to learn anybody can do it i think its good its great great great great great great great
the game of life is really fun and awesome and good graphics for a kindle game i love this game its worth the money
this is a great game , but the controls for steering on the kindle fire are very sensitive , that is the only reason for the 4 stars !
this game seems like it would be fun but you really cant see the stuff your looking for maybe because of color
the game itself is fun , but it freezes up on my kindle to often that i do n't really care to play it .
fun to play , easy to figure out , good graphics , good sound effects . i would recommend to people who enjoy pinball
very neat game . lot of content for a free app . i recommend it to anyone who likes being in charge of something . i have n't encountered any bugs . cool app .
this is a fun game additive and entertaining would recommend this game to friends and family the graphics are cool and funny
for free , this is a great app . allows me to see what programs are taking up the most memory and to easily force stop them if i would like
fun app . especially like the fact that you can play it with being connected to the internet and connect if when u want
it was a good game until it started with ads . then it had issues like starting over and going back to the same page i had just finished . i liked playing it til then .
fish farm is not my cup of tea , was ordered for my grand daughter when she spent the week end with me .
really great game . this is the first time that i have played it . something like diner dash and just as great .
since i am a big fan of christmas he really enjoys all the different pictures this book has . not to mention the quality time we spend together .
i downloaded this game thinking it would not be all that great . but i was wrong . it is both challenging and nicely detailed graphics to boot .
not my favorite game . slow moving through each board . not enough of a tutorial to help me . so no fun .
loved it wish there were more levels , once i play it it was over ... .. would give it a 5 if more levels ...
this game is ok but they should make more free levels . the mystery duck should be .99 cents not 2.99
this may be a good app on a full size computer but i do most of my research on my tablet . this app does not work properly for my needs .
i really like this app . i can save photos , music , documents all in one place . it 's easy to use . i really like being able to create my own folders to stay organized .
i am not great at riddles and only just started . so far i find it challenging and interesting . no problems .
every thing is pretty much locked . is is very realistic , however . but overall it would be cut for young children . ( if they are into it )
daughter loves it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! : - ) ! ! ! ! ! ! : - ) ! ! ! what more show i say !
alarm is easy to use . i like that it has the weather feature . good alarm sounds to choose from . nice clock .
lots of fun ! has many challenging levels . this game could use more levels . great graphics ! this game is very very addictive .
totally enjoy interaction of this game and chat feature to communicate with friends and family who live far away , and have met new friends
i love this game its not too hard and not to easy just put together well enough to keep you occupied
great free app . could use an undo button . but it was free so who 's complaining ? get this app . you will love it !
this game is very addictive i have a hard time not playing it everyday ! ! if you do n't have this game you should get it now ! !
fun to play . makes you think . moves fast . i love the games like this one . keep them coming . educational as well . the whole family can play along
i would not buy this game it 's boring and never ends , no point or challenge to it . if you want to be challenged then this is not the game for you
my grandson loves the game as do i. i find myself wanting to play the game every time i have a few minutes to spare .
this is kind of hard and not that fun but passes time i guess . would not let me get to level two so it has some issues .
my kids love this game . even the 5 year old is better at it than i am , and i 'm a video freak !
it 's a great idea but my daughter was bored in 2 min . plus the mistakes in the program should be fixed .
this game is really fun . the only bad thing is that you have lives and you have to wait for some time till you can play again
me and my brother tried to download it but it did n't work also it takes forever just to load a level up
i think it looks very nice but that 's about where it ends at least for me . i removed it within days . just was n't for me .
this game is a lot of fun and very challenging . it makes you think as to what each picture has in common .
overall this game is fun . not really anything especially good or anything . but it is kind of fun . i like it .
fun relaxing , no pressure , nice graphics , do n't have to buy anything but the game . i could live without finding the differences , otherwise fun game .
nice mix of creating a town and fighting the bad guys . a good game for a wide range of ages .
this game is sooooooo fun i am a boy and i love this game i think it is fun for all boys and girls
i was n't what i wanted and i had to purchase the full version key to get it to work . i wish i knew i would be happy with before i purchased the key .
i 'm not crazy about this game . i 'm older and like more of the card games and things to keep my mind going . my grandchildren love this game . so do many other people .
this is a wonderful version of the angry birds series . wish they had more ! finished all levels , all stars , etc .
i just thought i would try it out and found that i do n't like the speed of the game . it shows advertisements after each game .
i do n't get this game . maybe kids would like it . very boring ... not at all challenging . wish they would rate these games .
love this game , but it is very addicting . just wish it had an info button as most games do to explain the levels and options . it 's a great way to pass the time .
if you are a fan of diner games you should get this game . even if you never played a diner game before i promise you that this is a great game and i think everyone would love it .
graphics are superior and gameplay is awesome ! ! one of the best apps i have played ! i highly recommend downloading this game .
if u like sports games this is the game for u like the person said below me this game has some great graphics
this kept me busy for some time . i looked at comic books for a little while . i enjoyed it and read some free ones .
just started playing . it 's interesting so far . it froze a few times , but i just exited and started again . i 'm going to keep playing for now .
i don not have the original so i can not compare but this game is nice and better than jewel
my fault i did n't read the description well enough i though it was more of a logic puzzle than just a puzzle .
this app was fun and i am enjoying the adventure , thanks for your creativity on the app and mini games .
fun game , however , did n't play for 2 days , but was the highest battery drain on my device . what 's up with that ? uninstalled .
i like this game and played it often , until i found another one called backgammon free which i like a little better , better graphics .
not that entertaining but its good when you very bored but when you are bored , you could probably get way better free apps like fruit ninjas : )
this app is fun to play with . good time killer . only thing i would change is being able to save designs .
i ca n't get enough ! it 's just like the real deal except i 'm in the privacy of my own home or anywhere i want to play ! thanks again kindle fire !
i really like that i was able to start playing with no trying to figure it out . timer and auto finish are great features .
i really could not get it to work for me on my kindle . it might have been something else but i could not play it very well .
it has very little action and theres only 4 cars plus there is only one track i want more tracks more cars
this game could be played for hours and is so cheap . moms if your kids want something get this . this is the best and i move it .
i love this game but it is really challenging . this took me a long time to do the first puzzle . like i said very hard but will get better the more i play .
cant advance past the stupid rock . hint is useless . just keeps doing the same thing ! there should be a reset function or something !
it is fun so far . my five year old daughter was even able to guess a couple questions . i am only 6 questions in so far , but so far so good .
best game ever ! very addictive and fun . my entire family loves it . so download it . although do n't download the free version it ai n't free
the number of stars given by others show that i will not pay for the app . i pay only for apps that have 4 stars or better !
this is a really fun game ! the only downside is having to buy extra cards to finish some of the rounds .
this game takes a while to load and its good but not the best out there , but at least its free .
just ok. you have to think but you move along quite slowly . is it challenging ? that 's as matter of opinion now , is n't it .
it works like it is supposed to . it is easy to use . the price is very good . it is a video camera too .
the app was not what i expected . the trivia really was n't good . i wish that it was more of a brain training type of trivia .
violent ? is there blood in this game . can a little kid play it or is it too much for them
hate it ! all u do is play with a person on ice and press buttons ! it 's a waist of your time do n't get it ever !
it is a very helpful app . i think it is a good way to find out what is on tv .
it 's great to find an where you can download free music : ) listen to the saved list w/ o a wifi connection .
it gives great hints if you just think them through . can not go to the next one if draw a blank and need to go to another song and then go back .
was never ever able to really play it maybe i just could never figure it out you may have better luck then i did but i did not have any luck
this game is pretty good in all ways but i do n't like how the screen turns when ur gon na throw the ball
omg i love this , it runs perfectly , amazing graphics and so much fun . id totally pay money for this . glad its free though !
i like the app that gives videos about what is going on in the world . this one does not do that .
would like to see high scores . why do you need your name if it does n't keep track . it really works your brain . love it .
my phone died so i decided to get a texting app and i was very smart to get this . great notifications and hd graphics it is simple to use and is quick .
my nephew loves playing this on my kindle , make sure you do n't have in app purchases on as i learned that the hard way . but other than that , it is good and keeps the kiddos entertained
the random mahjong is one of my favorite mahjong games . it is a lot of fun to play and has a lot of screens t play .
i get to distract the young ones and its entertaining for them . there has n't been any glitches lately , so its been working pretty well .
great game is easy to play and understand . would recommend to anyone that likes to play slot machine games that do n't like to wait a long time for bonus coins .
i have n't played myself but the kids are loving it and that is why i got it for them . yeah
you know the answer but do you really know the answer ? it 's challenging and yet easy . it takes time to think and yet you might not still get it wrong .
great game , i would recommend this game to everyone . good story and a great way to spend your time . i ca n't wait to try the other games in this series .
my youngest is four , and he thoroughly enjoyed it . i was interested in the full version , but i could not see and upgrade price . i thought this very odd .
very fun game but you have to pay to keep going . i would have loved more levels for free . worth buying . graphics are good .
love this free game ! very easy to get into and start . my son likes to try and catch the animals that run in . overall fun and great game !
great game , tons of fun , i just wish there were more opportunities to use bananas for purchases instead of coins all the time . fun for kids and adults !
it is just garbage it 's basically unplayable and they have a bunch of games by same developer that are exactly they the same do n't waste time .
this app is similar to facebook but in my opinion i think it is better and also has a way better lay out and format of how they do things and how things work and run .
i have n't had much time to mess around with this app , but it seems to be a lot of fun . i look forward to working with it more .
i love this game . its interesting and challenges the mind with different ways to find objects . i love the story line as well like the game clue .
there is tournament play or individual . they have interactive fun boards and challenging prizes . it is fun and the time element makes it fun and challenging .
great game . i have the microsoft version on my laptop computer and i play it almost everyday . i love playing the classic version of this game .
fun game ... ... .if you just want something to do and to pass the time for just a few minutes . i like it ...
really awesome game i really like it . it teaches about responsibility for younger kids or older you can race clean
this game is full of interesting challenges and i enjoyed playing the different levels . i think a lot of people would enjoy this game .
good game - thanks for making it available . and i would recommend it to everyone who has time to play .
this is the most addictive game i have played . i ca n't stop . ca n't wait to see what the levels bring . hope not disappointed .
its very addictive and i enjoy playing it the levels keep you going and they are interesting to complete . love it a lot
this app is cool but i am 11 and some of the logos are really hard . but over all its pretty fun !
this is very convenient for when you are away from the house to make sure you do n't miss your shows .
it is fun and challenging for all ages . my four year old enjoys the lower levels and i enjoy it all !
if you have played any of the angry birds games this is a great game to add to the collection .
this app is really fun at first but gets a little repetitive i like the different races and characters but not very detailed
if you like movies and want to spend a few minutes using your memory , this is a very good way to do it
i like this game because it 's colorful which holds my attention and it 's fun to have payouts that are fun and exciting - cute also .
i did n't mean to download it again . i already have it several time . sorry , i made a mistake . now just let me delete .
my grandchildren enjoyed this game but we had to buy more options for it to be very good . after that was better .
it 's really fun for little kid s lol my kid knows how to play it and i do n't know what they teach me
awesome game and it starts to get addicting but not to me i play it like 2 time a day
i love the game it is great you should by it it is totally worth being around in this world . it is such a cool game . i am happy the kindle fire is around .
our entire family loves this game . it is easy and everyone down to the youngest grandchild can play with this awesome game .

this piano master christmas app is a great time waster and a lot of fun to fool around with . i just love it !
this is a really good app and i think you should get it because it is a great way to spend time .
this was actually better than i expected . a little cheesy but a good game & it held my interest . will play the next one .
most of the movies wo n't load for me . i had this app for only a few days before deleting . too limited in selection and poor at loading .
its fun you get a free spin every 3 hours . i wish you got the hinton bucks a little more often .
great game for all bingo lovers everywhere ! ! ! give this a try as it is challenging and fun for all ages . go ! ! bingo ! !
fun to play , lots of big pay outs . great graphics and color . the best slots i 've played . make more slots games with big pay outs .
i downloaded this for a little girl who was visiting and she seemed to enjoy it very much . she had her granny write the title so her mother could get for her to play at home .
love this game it is so fun ! it makes me laugh and that is a good thing . it 's easy to learn and fun for all .
this game is loads of fun . i just cant stop playing . the graphics are stunning , so colorful and clear . i love it .
pretty good graphics and skill levels recommend others to give it a try . better than most zombie related games i have tried
great app ! ! i looked at many before i downloaded this one . quite satisfied , extremely nice that it is free too ! ! !
i love playing this game . i see why it is 5 stars . if i were you , i would get it .
fun app with a lot of different slot games to play . many ways to play and win . also many offers to get coins .
this is so easy to use and has everything you need . others that i have tried did not even have a percent to use .
i enjoy looking at it . have n't had to use it for anything , not sure if i will keep it . do n't do much flying anymore
this game 's hardest level is level 19 in chapter 3. it is sort of a horrible game.i do n't like this game that much .
thought it was too easy so deleted it after first try . was colorful and should be for children about 10 years old .
fun game . my grand kids really love it . they want to play it whenever they come over to see us .
extremely additive just wish the payout for work and everything would be a little more but that makes me stay on to keep earning
again ... .this one did not hold my attention like the magic jigsaw puzzle app ... not as many options and pictures were poor quality .
find this game to be interesting it challenges your eye coordination powers to figure how to find the missing items
i like the animation of the game . it keeps my attention and keeps me wanting to play more . way fun game of bingo
i loved all the puzzles and hope you put on more and larger ones . they were great to put together .
so it 's a good game but keeps having to force close on my kindle fire when they update it it will be the best game on my kindle .
this is a fun app . i ; highly recommend this . i have enjoyed it alot . you can draw things and take notes .
it is a good game . i just wish that the game makers would make it easier to get gold . other than that it is a good game .
this is a pretty okay game . the graphics are amazing . i like the way gamers seem to enter from the street .
parents they have bad clothes i would say for a 13 year old . i just do not like it for me a 8
my daughter enjoys the game though you have to spend alot of money for the added features to play game .
my granddaughter loves this game when she comes over that 's what she plays , she is trying to teach me , it takes time
i play with computer and is a good challenge . gives good practice for playing other players . this is a family favorite .
i 'm still in the free version and enjoying this game a lot . the story line is interesting and there are not a lot of hog scenes which is fine with me . nice graphics too .
wow , let me just say this app is amazing . i highly recommend you to get it because its a fun app and its really addicting .
the . game is fun and very hard to figure out the words . but it is fun to play the game and it is worth getting the game for free
it is an alright pass timer but does n't give you much options . actual card game is more fun to play .
my kids love this game and play it all the time . i have been known to play it as well , the only problem is , once you start you ca n't stop !
i love this game i really do , but it 's really difficult to get weapons and armor without buying it with real money / :
this is one of the best games ever . the graphic update really had an effect on it and the multiplayer is awsome
it would n't work on my kindle fire hd . i tried everything i could think of . nice idea , but a waste of time .
i really like this solitaire app . unfortunately , it has become very addictive for me since i waste much time playing it .
just started playing today and downloaded all the games . no real money necessary to play but i do need neighbors . fun !
had it two days . now wo n't even load . if i reinstall , i 'll loose every thing i build . not a memory problem on my device .
i usually do n't play or like games like this one , but it was faotd , so i got it and it is great ! it has tons of levels and is very entertaining .
i love this . app is so awesome i mean its tree 's plus its like you take ' n care of a pet or a living thing ! ! ! ! ! !
i use this app every day and the format is great . it 's quick to find the news i seek and i always find other news i was n't aware of . stay informed !
fun game young kids can play several types of sharks a lot of fish to eat ... and other sharks its fun try it out
this game is fun to play . sometimes it seems difficult to guess the word until you start using the help letters . then you feel dumb because it is so obvious .
i enjoy playing mahjong and this format is really cute and fun . nice colors and symbols . if you like to play mahjong , you will enjoy this version .
might be nice if it stated it needed a wifi connection in the description . visiting family and not around wifi till i go home now have to sit with this in my bar till i can download it .
i had this app on my ipod touch before and loved it ! so glad its now on the android and free today on amazon app to boot !
so far anyway hope i can keep going . i am playing on my kindle . having way too much fun with games .
i think this game is super fun and it even helps me spell ! you should definitely download it . it is a better version of scramble and its free ! ! ! !
it is quite challanging . i watch many movies but really had to think . some of the graphics are not very clear .
not great , not terrible . does n't save your high scores - only fills the top spot . long way to go just to be rated good . hoping for improvement soon .
i will have to monitor his access but we will enjoy the movies too ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! thank you ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! we would not change anything .
this is a really fun game . i ca n't get past level ten ; it seems almost impossible . this is not a good game for people who have anger issues .
this app sucks and is just a copy of temple run . temple run is way better , plus its free . get temple run and save yourself a dollar .
fun game . like the offer of 100 coins for a review ! more challenging than the first set but in a good way .
best game ever i would like the freezing to stop though when i got it i was addicted to it and i still am
great game for kids and adults too . i really love watching my daughter get into this game and have fun learning ! !
good questions and categories -- some are very difficult and some pretty easy . graphics are good . would recommend this ap to anyone who likes the jeopardy show or a challenge .
use this app , more with the smartphone . get movie on the ride home .
you got ta give it a shot . take a bit of time to get to know it . this is really one unique game .
im addicted ! love this game . play it all the time . recommend it for all ages . fun for the whole family .
this an ok game , i think it always good to have a few extra challenges , i was n't sure what to expect .
this game is fun and addicting . i love that i get to compete with real people and not the computer . my boyfriend likes to play against me too which makes it more fun
this game is so fun and challenging ! it is also addicting , so be careful : ) my four year old sister likes to play it and my 19 year old sister and my mom !
the review stated it would teach piano . when i downloaded it a piano keyboard popped up but no instructions and no way to get out of it . deleted it .
it is necessary for anyone who uses their phone frequently and has multiple accounts . it creates passwords for you our saves your own .
such a great game to play when at work ! would recommend it to anyone who wants to pass the time !
super cute and tons of fun . great graphics & challenging levels . worth the money . i 'll be sad when i get all the levels , ca n't wait for new ones
this game is okay , have n't played it much . however , for the most i played it great . get you use to playing high with really dollars .
my niece likes this program . i have not seen it yet , but she says it is fun to use , so i trust her on that .
great little game . i think my granddaughter will love it . i even like it . it was free cant complain about that .
love this game . its so much like the actual show . love that i can compete against my facebook friends . you should definitely get this app . you will love it !
not very exciting , but my son loves it , so it 's a keeper . it 's easy to use and beautiful to look at .
this game is kind of boring does not keep your interest in the game . however the graphics are pretty peaceful along with the sounds .
i gave this rating because it was a good game . i like this game . it was as they had described it
i downloaded the & # 34 ; offline & # 34 ; bible to use when i could not connect to a wireless system and it worked great ! thanks for the easy use and offline versions available .
if you like bingo blitz , you will love the fast paced action in bingo rush . challenge and fun all in one game !
just downloaded and seems like fun . different from other bubble popping games . i would recommend downloading this game if you like these kind of games
this is a entertaining and actually quite challenging game as things progress . it 's really fun and i come back to it often .
seemed interesting ... ... but really was n't . there really are n't any cameras worth watching . i just deleted it . not sure why all the other reviews were so good .
keeps you wanting the next part of the story . get this game . just like the pc hidden object games . good storyline .
fun game . i prefer this game too candy crush . it is similar to another game i used to play where the bubbles kept dropping . this game is less stressful , though .
great way to spend a few hours . i only have it 4 stars because it was n't long enough . if they add to the game i 'll give it 5 .
i love it but first i thought it was about doing missions like walking and stuff like that but whatever i totally recommend this app to iron man lovers ! : d especially that gameloft made this ! !
i like the game but i dont like how much it cost to get a new game everytime . over all the games are cool .
i can not connect to google from here and my account on my phone is on google not facebook so its annoying for that , but the gameplay is great . recommended it 's very addictive
its kinda easy but its also kinda hard at some point . plus its just to simple then it becomes way to hard
this game goes at just the right speed for seniors to keep up . i 'm a bingo junkie and play several games on my kindle , but this is a favorite .
very easy to read and it has every book ! and it breaks it down into each category . i love it . always at your fingertips . thanks so much .
the controls are awful . the game is worth what i paid for it . which is nothing . do n't waste your time getting this app .
it down loaded nice to my fire and the graphics are good . keeps you wanting to come back for more
this game is so awesome ! it does n't slow down or freeze and i 'm completely addicted to it . i play it everyday !
wow i would totally recommend this game to other people . the storyline is the best i 've seen and it keeps me hooked
on my kindle fire it keeps closing on me right in the middle of playing . i would like it if it would stay on
i love the app , if only i had more money to play longer . just like the casinos , just move on .
this is a great game it 's kinda like the old pokemon i would recommend this game if your up for a challenge
the google keyboard does everything this does and is included on most devices . also , it looks better in my opinion .
finally on amazon ! i love this app ! when you play this game everyday you zoom through it but i still love it ! totally reccomended !
this is definitely a great application . everything you need from the web version , but made for a tablet or mobile device . glad i got it .
i love playing this game at any time . the cards move well and the game is easy to play . it is a must have game !
very useful . it 's nice to have it on my kindle fire when i do n't have my computer handy , and i can do a quick check on places i may visit .
easier way for me to jump on and check out what is going on in between reading books . will love having the extra access
this game is ok. if i were you i would not get it . it is a boring game . do not get this app ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
this game is so addicting ! love how the games are timed . makes it challenging . could probably play day ! sooo much fun !
it 's awesome it is not a waste of time if you buy it it is challenging take my word for it
this game is alright . it 's a decent crossword app . i plan to keep it installed . i do n't play it that often .
wish i could give you a review , but it never downloaded to my kindle , not sure why , but i deleted from my account because it never loaded .
this game works well and is fun : ) what more can one say ! ! ! ! easy to follow and has different yahtzee games .
i use this good app to see good movies without paying any coin . i recomend you this app . remember is free and you can watch a lot of movies .
very fun game hope u enjoy as much as i do only bad thing is u ca n't up ur defense
hate this i this it is so bad that it dont even get get star . dont get it bad jokes
this app is really fun i love it so much it 's amazing it could use better graphics though it 's awsome
a fun way to pass the time while in between classes or at the doctor 's office or just anywhere , anytime . only been playing it for a few days and i think i 'm becoming addicted !
i been playing tiny monsters for 6 months i check in everyday to feed them and breed them . it 's a real time game so sometimes it kinda slow but i been hooked on it
this is a great app , now when you just ca n't remember that song that plays over and over in your head , now you can know the name and artist .
it 's never boring . i have it on my phone , and on my tablet . it 's good for my brain , i believe .
perfect app for my bank and lets me do whatever i want for the most part from home which is very nice when my bank is a 30 minute drive and i feel like being lazy .
find this game to be quite addictive and even fun . learning curve at first , as instructions are a little vague . good fun . works great without any issues on the kindle fire .
was fun , difficult to control though ! not something you 'd play more than a few times , but worth the download when it 's free . : )
the app does not connect on my kindle at all , it just sits and tries to connect . do not get .
game is awesome ! pay outs are huge and new games keep adding more money ! ! ! if you are needing a fun way to pass time this is a fine choice .
i like the game , so far . i like that there is a second challenge within the item search scenes . only on chapter 4 , so not too far into know if it 's short or long .
i really enjoyed this game . this is one of the best games of its kind . it makes you think , that 's for sure
not so hard that you ca n't do it , hard enough to keep yourself amused for a good length of time .
i like games that have levels of challenge . did n't really dislike anything about this game . i would recommend this game for teen and older .
tiles too small to work with on a kindle and trying to read what is on the tiles is just too hard .
they have cute stories as well as being great time management games . they 're on the easy side but fun to play
the pictures are very pretty and i like that there are 3 different ways to search for the objects , but once you go through it , it is the same next time .
if you enjoy browsing pinterest , you 'll love this app ! it 's a fun way to pass time when i 'm waiting at the doctor 's office or in line somewhere .
this app is cool but there 's not a lot to do using kindle fire if you press most apps it will open an ad . awesome but not all that awesome .
ok this game was pretty good , fairly easy . i liked the story real well and it played nice on my second gen kindle .
i just tried this game on my my phone and played it until the battery died so i found it for my kindle fire and downloaded i 'm hooked i love it .
grand kids thought it was just ok , was n't very excited over it but was an ok game to play . thanks
i played it once and it was a good game of its type . i do not play this type of flying game . it did play well .
if you like the xbox edition then you will love this game i would recommend this game to everyone so if you 're a guy that does n't like minecraft your not a guy .
it was a free seek and find game , and i like playing with it . helps pass the time while my daughters are in school .
great app ! it really is cute . we have n't seen anything this nice for awhile . and whoever made this is a very smart and creative person .
my 10 year old loves these games ! they are fairly easy , great follow up to first one . i would defiantly recommend it and so far no problems playing it on the kindle fire .
this game was okay , although the graphics are not very good . i found the game fairly simplistic and i solved the entire game in a very short time .
this is a terrible game . there is no point to it and i do n't think its worth the 99 cents . it should be free ! it is not entertaining at all and i regret buying it .
my little brother is addicted to this game . in updated versions you can unlock different types of clothing . i highly recommended that you buy this game
it is a good app for when you do n't feel like searching the internet for the latest world news and are lazy .
we have tried downloading this app twice it does not work , we have tom the cat and my daughter was looking forward to this app too .
i would recommend this game to everyone i love playing it it 's extremely addicting my whole family gets involved in the game !
i am pretty impressed with this app.it is by no means a substitute for microsoft office , however it gives you enough in the way of editing options to get a pretty great start on just about any project .
for all the people who have a kindle fire , this game will not work , maybe the first few times , but then , everytime you open it , it will close out of the game by itself
overall this is a very good application , but i would like it to have more of the features like the ios app .
it was helpful and educational and help explore my mind . it even helps learn new things and was fascinating . i love the game for these reasons . it really deserves 5 stars .
i love it , excellent game ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ; ) if you want to be entertains for hours tried this game . ; ) there many games out there but this is the best .
i would like to ride the horse and actually clean thing . overall its okay . i also would like for you to be allowed to name your 1st horse .
fun . addictive game constantly playing you get grabs by waiting 30 seconds instead of buying with real money . that 's great .
this is as good as on my computer , i love this game and have had no problem on my kindle fire . i play at least 3 times a week , works perfectly .
i 've had this app for quite a while and still have n't been able to beat the while thing . each level is different and challenging in its own way . definitely worth a try .
this is a perfect app for anyone who wants to text their friends and does n't have a phone . get it ! ! ! !
lots of fun and is a quick play . it is another good game to help learn and stay alert . many topic selections .
its just really bad , and its slow , and the graphics are terrible . and its just not fun . you cant even get that many birds , there are way more fun pet games than this .
i 've been using this app since i got my kindle fire , and have not had a single issue with it . very useful and customizable .
this keeps me entertained all the time if you 've ever played kick the buddy this is actually better ! as far as i played you are n't asked to pay with actual money its so entertaining and cool
great for me and the kids to pass the time at appointments and things ! would recommend this game id you like & # 34 ; island & # 34 ; games : )
i use this app all the time and i got my college age daughter to use it also . works great !
never heard of this first song and it wont let me past so i 'm unable to play this game . very frustrated , but it was free so ca n't complain to much .
have n't played long but fun so far . we 'll see how it goes once into higher levels . might review again then .
i did n't like the product so i uninstalled it . to me it was n't very user friendly and not much on instructions .
i got hooked on this game played the whole 60 something boards in one day . it 's all about mind playing . figuring things out
if you 're strong suit is n't doing calculations in your head while out to dinner or lunch , then this app may be perfect for you .
interesting so far . have not gotten very far yet . the first couple of tasks made me think this was to easy of a game , but that is certainly not the case .
a bit hard to get acorns though . but it is pretty fun maybe another mini game to play though would be fun
this was a bit boring . i deleted it and regret wasting my time .
fun game to help pass the time . worth the download , will recommend to all . have played it for a few hours now .
i 'm not interested in video games . my son showed me this one and i 'm hooked . it 's a great way to pass time when you have to wait in an airport or doctor ' office .
this is one of my favorite computer games and i was happy to find it in an app for my tablet . it is challenging as you have to watch where you move cards to benefit the end result .
it 's a good game for free . it 's good to pass the time when you have some free time to yourself .
if you are looking for a good app this is your app . i 'm a girl and i like . best game ever .
when i get bored this is the app i go too . i think that everyone should get it . i recommend it to everyone
better than circle word in books , addicting and entertaining ! all the grand kid love it also ... keeps them entertained for hours
perfect for free this is a good to waste time with . great time killer . way to go . what else can i say about it .
i love monkey 's and this game is so exciting just wish that i could play it longer before time runs out .
i could use a little more points but i love the multiple games , the different bonus features in each game .
i love this game so much ! ! ! ! its fun and challanging too ! i love how it has different speeds for you to .
very helpful to keep my calendar and life up to date . the reminders are great , too , if i choose to use them . also , very handy . thank you .
i love the set up of facebook for the kindle , it has a very large display of each post and it 's quickly response to each swipe and tap .
i wanted a calculator for my kindle fire and this was the perfect fit . try it , you 'll like it i 'm sure !
i got this for my grandson and he loves it . has been playing it now every chance that he gets
if you just need something to kill time and still stimulate your mind this is a very good one to do it . there are many levels and tons of games on each level . i recommend this game .
i ca n't work with 2 hands and ca n't keep him on the road . maybe someday i will get the feel of it .
i played it once and did n't care for it . i did n't like that you had to tap the colors twice to make them disappear . my opinion is , it was n't all that .
it is very fun to play . it moves along pretty good . it can be for adults or children . enjoy playing everyone .
yes , the review looks fake , but the app has been out for a while . just because this is the first time you have seen it does n't make it new .
this was an awesome game especially for an adult and avid mystery lover . i have a difficult time with my eyes so this was just what i needed . so hope to see more of these soon .
i downloaded this game onto my kindle for me to play . so far so good . my 7 year old grand daughter enjoys playing it also .
i love . to play games at night to try to relax . fun game . easy enough to not drive you insane but does keep you thinking

my sister and cousin love fashion designer : wedding dresses . i think it is an awesome game . but it should be free .
i just got it will not load not so happy so i hope a lot of you like it : p.s kinda love it
great ! ! ! ! the dinosaurs are very cute and funny looking . the buildings are unique and big . there is a lot of things in the game .
it 's really cool and makes all your drawings look professional . the only problem is it does n't have a normal brush . if it had a regular one i would give it five stars .
it 's great . i use it weekly . no more printing recipes from my computer ( wasting paper ) just have my kindle fire in front of me at the kitchen counter .
love this game . have played for years online , now on my kindle ! must pass every level to proceed to next .
it was very easy to find a selection in this bible . you can select book , then chapter from the menu . i 've been using this for a few months and it is great .
this another great game like dinner dash . i only played the free version , would have liked the full version but i like to save my money on books .
confusing controls at first but once i got the hang of it i loved it ! so addicting and extra entertaining : )
i love this game . there is so many beautiful things . so much to do . i can play this game for hours .
great game for brain activity and keep sharp . also addictive and maintain good level of interest . i can play this game for a long time without getting bored as every game is new and challenging .
... .but like it so far . the game play is good and the graphics are well done . not sure if it will continue to keep my interest , but we 'll see ... .
i have tried multiple times to install and load the game and so far it will not work on my kindle fire hd .
this game is hard to get started playing . i guess i just do n't understand why i can not just open and then play a simple game of cards
i like playing this on my kindle bb the best and this is second i love playing bingo good luck all
i loved the game and my dad had to stop me from playing the entire thing in a day ! though i do n't understand the trees , they look like they have paper leaves .

fun game where you grow monsters . it can be frustrating trying to get the monsters you want and if you do n't have patience you can end up spending to get the monsters . very addictive .

very scary and great graphics will put you on the edge of your seat ! i think it 's one of the best games on the kindle fire hd . totally try it .

not a bad game that was free , graphics are great and the sound is great also . need to grab your own and start playing now ... ... ... ... ... ... ...

great app . came recommended and works fantastic . i even get to review its work . give it a try . it 's a must-have .
it 's okay . i do like that you can get more backgrounds to choose from , i just wish you could delete the ones it comes with when you first open the app .
this app is really distracting for the baby , we use it alot since it makes fun noises and has alot of colors ! : )

i really like this game it is the best mini golf game i 've ever seen . i not to hard or too easy . this is a great game .
it kills time pretty well . the levels can be hard to pass but the attempts to get past the level can be more fun than actually winning the level .
not for me ! maybe if i played with somebody who knows the game already it would be different . i couldnt get off two blocks , so it didnt hold my interest .
will not load the games and only a few posts at a time . very big disappointment as i love fb and really wanted to play games on the go : ( please fix this app .
very good app also addicting though get this app works great on a my kindle fire get the app please

this is a fun game . not so hard that you lose interest . very addictive . i highly recommend this game to everyone .

not to thrilled of it at all . not sure why but if i were you i would give it a try
it is very challenging game , it did slow down as i went farther into the game , it started to pause and slow down .

really like the graphics ( much easier on my eyes than the more colorful versions ) , and the music is sort of fun . fun way to pass the time .

it 's angry birds . i 'm gon na love it no matter what . my nephews and niece like to use my kindle to play it too .
this game is okay . not too exciting . the first time you play it is fun but after a while , it becomes boring really quick .
it 's fine until you have your account set up then when you tap on something it will go back sometimes even back to the app store this app is junk !
for someone like me i love music and i went on pandora all the time but now it wont let me in the app . serious problem needs to be fixed
i 'm having such a fun time with this game ! i never used to win when i was a kid , but it 's satisfying to be able to kick the computers butt !
i love this game it gets challenging and kinda frustrating all in one . it kinda lags sometimes so that kinda sucks but otherwise great graphics .
i love this app . i liked the fact that it is free . i use this app for texting my friends and family , and it works very well .
now i always know where and when i need to be somewhere . very simple to use and i find it helpful
this is a great casino game . very enjoyable game they add a new slot game every day too . from what i understand there is in game purchasing but i have been winning since i started playing .
love this tetris game . rounds are short enough that you can play a round even when you are busy and do not have a lot of free time to play .
just downloaded this app for kindle fire hd opened it and had no problem watching shows it worked just fine for me
i have this game for my pc . i am glad they made it for kindle . i will spend many hours playing it . good graphics and challenging game play make one of the best .

i wish it was more educational . it is a fun little app thought , they enjoy playing it i guess . no problems with it .
this game is awesome . totally addictive , i would recommend this app , you can play without being connected . i was up late the first night i used the app .
it was exactly what i was expecting . it only has 2 play modes but that is good enough for me . i am constantly trying to best myself .
i like this game and have a hard time putting it down . this game is challenging but not too difficult . and it 's . free .
no instructions ... no story ... plain boring . even for free its not worth the time . better games out there . deleted first day
any time i get a chance to kill zombies i do this game is fun and addicting i recommend this game
this is an awesome game u need to get it it 's a awesome card game it 's amazing trust me i bet u will like this awesome game
i got this and app to play on the train . only on problem i must be on wireless to us it . this is an epic fail on my part not to research this better .
addicting is about all i can say about this game . once you start it 's hard no to stop good thing you only get 5 live to start . it 's the waiting that 's hard .
it 's a little piano , it 's handy , it plays a few songs , the sound is ok and it was free . life is good and so is this app !
u cant do anything and u have to wait . it doesnt show ur baby doing anything . the most u do is change the name .
is a good and funny app that children often enjoy . once they used it a lot is not that funny .
i really like this game . it is fun because u get to make a village and raise dinosaurs it is fun
player would n't load , and when it did had only a few videos . very disappointed . i removed it from my kindle right after installing .
it was a good simulator i really enjoyed it . it was the best one i have found so far thank you for this
get this app it is awesome real looking cars and awesome cars to totally great at money free get this
super cool game ! really makes you use your brain , so you ca n't really space it and play as much as i do when finding the birds , but i love it , really different .
hahaha i love this app ! i always wanted to play piano , now i can , well sort of . its also nice just to listen to the songs .
my daughter was n't interested in this one so i removed it from my kindle . i do n't think it was anything wrong with the app just not really her thing .
this game is so much fun . i ca n't stop playing it . the more levels i get to the more harder it gets .
it gives me a challenge because you have to have a number of points to get another game ! its fun
this is a pretty darn good game . especially to be free ! it can . be a bit frustrating to wait for energy to fill up but it 's fun otherwise .
numbers came in too fast , and then froze my kindle fire hdx ! ! ! ! decided to delete ... did not like this bingo game .
this app is fun to play with friends when you are bored . it is fun fun fun fun fun fun ! you should download this app ! ! ! ! ! ? ?
there were not any instructions for playing this game . where are the instructions and then i can play this game
i am really enjoying this game . i like the way you have it set up . keep up the good work with this game .
this game is so easy . you can pass the levels just like that . i thought it might be a little harder .
this game is good for those you like to figure out puzzles and search for items . looking may take some patience , but items are fairly easy to manipulate .
i have been searching for a fun game for a while and i love it ! ! i can not wait for more levels !
i did n't know you need internet with this app . i want bible i can use any where .
i can not get past the engine room so i 'm am getting free hint for this review ! i would recommend this app ! ! !
i agree there are a lot of ads and some of the games are difficult but all the same i think they are enjoyable .
like the hint and advice button , wish it was longer especially for $ 1.99 . was a good story , like that you are different characters , in the story .
too much trouble trying to get the shapes to form that you want to draw . boring and not much fun .
this app is awesome . its fun fast free and easy to navigate . it may be basic but its all you need to talk to your friends . the only bad thing is that you need internet .
useful . i use this at work and at home . friends who see this immediately download it for their phone as well
i wish it gave you a few hints sometimes other than that its a ok game .if you like puzzels you like it
i absolutely & lt ; 3 this game . i have had it for about a week or so and have played it many times and it has n't crashed yet .
a decent driving game with good physics and challenging gameplay . needs to be easier to get coins for upgrading and fixing your vehicles
do not get this app is horrible i do n't get how you get back up because i keep on pressing the screen but it wo n't go up
i play it everyday to see if i can get a higher score and my guy keeps trying to out score me
i found this game very entertaining with a variety of themes . in fact it is one of my favorite games .
simple and great to keep my parents ' busy when they are at a restaurant and waiting for food . has a & # 34 ; guess & # 34 ; feature .
i am smart and got a game that does n't ask for info . its awesome . i love it . get it ! ! ! ! awesome game ! ! ! ! ! : - )
fun game . but i always run out of tokens and have to quit playing . they should give you more free tokens .
great music for all likes . great to choose music that i like to listen too and ease of use it fabulous !
best word game on the market ! get it ! you wo n't be sorry trust me + it 's free so that adds to how awesome it is ! !
this game is fun . it is a little more challenging than others . some of the pictures are not easy to see . it is a game that makes you think .
i really liked this game because it is challenging but also allows you to think and act on clues and combinations ...
well just wanted to try it and see what it was but i really do not like it like i thought it was .
i looked at the pictures and i already know that it is stupid . who would even buy this app ? sooooo stupid
great game , amazing graphics , very addicting . very frustrating though because of constant time limits , endless attempts to get money out of you
it 's a great game i love it the game has a great graphics but the way your games currency sucks and the way every thing cost a fortune
its a lot of fun ... .. keeps me entertained . its a fast moving game so you do n't get board and my kids love it too .
i am really loving this game ! ! it is very entertaining . hours of fun ! ! i recommend every one try this game..
so . far so good . it is fun . good graphics . um cute pictures . um um my kids like . it . i do to
its cool . it gets a bit boring after a while . but you might as well download it , i mean its free . and if you do n't like it just delete it .
this one of my fav games for kindle . it can be a little slow but it is still awesome . : )
love it so much it should let you pick your own logo though it would make it easier . but i recommend this .
i downloaded by mistake , i was looking for photos slide show for kindle fire ... application seems ok but not for me .
this game is fun but it is pretty easy . though i say that it passes time and keeps me busy
i love all solitaire games and this one is not different . great game and i play ti often . do buy
not the best game i played , took me awhile to figure out how to keep it moving . i own and have played better games than this .
my daughter loves the princess memory game because of the pretty pictures . i like it because it helps her memory .
i like this because i can stay in touch with family and friends and catch up on the latest news and games
cool app 4 kindle fire . and it tells u a lot of stuff like your battery and how long of time you have ben on stuff
i love this game . i have it on all my devices . the only thing i do n't like is the limited game play .
i like that u have to gradually unlock each of the 101 in 1 + 20 it 's cool with me , if u like variety download it
i love the game , but i get sick and tired of facebook coming up all the time . if it were n't for that , i 'd give it 5 stars and this game would be perfect .
cant put it down so far . only on first level tho . moves quickly and keeps my interest could use more bonuses
it needs more demo time for like a hour but it is fun because i 'm still trying to build my manor .
i did n't like it because it was a bit too challenging to think of the words without more hints . just not in the mood for that .
storyline is not good graphics are horrible then at the last mission the data of the game was lost but they left me with my guns then took them
this is a fun game compared to the others . i have played a lot of these free games , i find this one better than most .
this game is very cool and challenging . i think people of all ages could play it . i really like it .
is it weird that i find this game kinda fun ? i sure hope not because it is a good way to pass some time .
my daughter loved this game ... so do i but she wont share . keep up the good work ! you should do kid models !
this app is ok but nothing to write home about . it is kind of fun but not that great of a review tool which is what i wanted
it tells you everything you want to know . you can leave settings for notifications too . i recommend this app yo everyone . it works on the kindle fire .
i liked playing this game but have it download on my phone so i just did n't want to have it on my kindle .
my niece love this app . wish to find more like this one . she does the makeup over and over again .
have not been able to figure out how to use this game ; need better directions so will probably delete it..
the description says it all . i am a big fan of audio books because i prefer that to listening to radio stations .
does n't seem to be as difficult as temple run 2 , but it is better than temple run 1 ... so there
this game challenges you to expand you knowledge and react faster . it helps you to learn new this and remember things you forgot you knew .
i love to draw so i like this app it is awesome and i like frozen if you like them two things you will love this app
just an ok alarm app . do n't really see anything special about it from other apps out there . i give it 4 stars because it does what it is supposed to do .
fun to try out all the different games . you win a lot so you do n't need to pay for money to play with .
i enjoy playing flo free it is so addictive , i play it every spare time i got . can not put it down
this is a really cool app , its a fun toy to play with , however i do n't like how the motion works on the kindle .
crash ! crash ! crash ! app is always freezing up and tried on 3 different devices still crashes then tried on different internet speed still crashes
i love this app ! it is so fun and addicting . my sister and i love it . it is one of our favorite games by far . i recommend this app to other girls .
i love it ! .i 'm not going to lie though it dose have some bugs but i 'm the only person who likes it or was but i recommend it so get it
i think this game should be free for kindle fire instead of it being 2 dollars because ive played it on my brothers phone and i loved but id rather be able to play it on my kindle fire
it is a okay game . i was hoping it would be more enjoyable . it does make you think . you have to know your logos .
i hate that i have to start all over again because downloaded on a new device , but i guess that is the price you have to pay
highly addictive and fun ! i could n't stop playing it , i beat the game in one night . i would recommend it for sure .
this the only social network game i play . nothing else comes close as far as i 'm concerned . buy the ad free one .
pretty popular with my 3 year old son ! he is in love with any and all angry birds ! love it
although i am currently stuck on a level , i still play and enjoy it . it 's not only addicting , but entertaining . great way to just chill out .
wow ! love this app ! love it so much . only comment is that wish there were more locations ... ... get it ! i love it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
i like this game . but it is a betting game . so if you do n't like betting games , i do n't recommend this game to you . the graphics are good .
i play all the time i have now gotten my sister addicted to playing the game i freaking love it
i love it it is so fun and so easy at the same time . i love it ok love it .
i play this all the time . i love all the different options given for number of points for a match , etc .

my lil sister loves this game and i enjoy playing it with her ! i just wish there were more things to do ...
awesome this game rules cool . this is not a waste of space yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
good game to play ... ... just needs more guns and better upgrades but over all i like this game i give this three stars
what do you expect . freezes some but ok. do not waste any money on it . a mindless waste of time
if your into poker this game is for you . i found it boring after awhile . not much more i can say about this except try it you may like it .
great game . i highly recommend it as a way to pass time and to give your brain a workout . have at it !
fun to play , challenging on the higher levels , but am from the old school and really prefer the word search books we work on all the time .
for the most part this is just what i expected from a mystery hidden object game . everything seems a bit small of a tablet . i would not be able to play this on a phone for sure .
excellent game with a lot of challenges ; i play every day trying to move up to additional challenges . excellent fun !
this is a very fun relaxing game in which i can make matches in any direction . the music and graphics are nice too . fun game for everyone .
i like the game it 's just you run out of money fast personally i would buy game i would like to see them make a 3rd to the game
i love this app ! this shows whenever i open my phone , and the numbers are actually big enough to read without glasses , an added bonus .
overall a great game ! the graphics are pretty good and its just a fun concept . i really like it . thumbs up !
i would rate it 2 stars but my friend likes it so i guess he counts to so i would not get this game
my 5 year old has loved this game since he was 2 years old . i 've played it as well , it 's worth downloading !
i really enjoyed tho . value of the coins and it was just a great gamei totally one hundred percent reccommend this game for anyone
i just started playing so i 'm not sure about it . i seems like it will be pretty cool if i could just figure out what to do .
i tried this game at school . i added a box to the house ! my life was bad so i wanted to see if it can get better !
i liked this game but the demo only goes so far and then you ca n't play any more . i do n't pay for games .
this is one of my favorite mindless games provides hrs of fun so simple yet so much fun . this is a must have
fun game . like that can change tiles . would recommend to any one who like this sort of game . fun . fun .
i liked the story , the graphics were decent , all in all a fun game . however i really wish were n't so many hidden object games and more puzzles that made you think .
this is an amazing puzzle game . and its free so you do n't have to pay for it . its very fun
this is an amazing game to pass time and stuff but it gets kinda hard to play cuz i 'm only 12 but other then that its an amazing game ! ! ! ! !
its a fun game but its way to expensive . i bought it and i guess its worth it but could be cheaper .
this is the kind of game i like to play . it was a good length . i felt like i was there and hated when the game ended . had a good story line .
this game is lots of fun . a good time waster , enough content to keep you coming back for more . highly recommend ! !
this is just plain fun . it is fun to play with my two year old when she wont let me read my ebooks .
this game is real cool me and my friends love this game it 's a lot of fun to play and it keeps me and my friends busy
i use this snow rain sun this is cool a a a a a a a a a a a
i love this app , though it would be nice if the updates came out at the same time as it does on apple products
love having this game on my kindle ! anyone who likes word games will like this . hope the puzzles change more frequently tho
does what it is supposed to do . a good solitaire game . i recommend it . great application for a free ap .
i 'm not on twitter as much but i do use it for accessing different people and connecting with upcoming events .
i put this on my kindle for my grandson . he just loves it . he is 4 years old and will sit and play this for hours .
never played hearts before this game . i really like the game of hearts . i highly recommend this game . graphics are great
i got this for my 3 year old , not worth it ! ! ! ! should be free the balls do n't work very well at all like they should at all very disappointed with this app !
this is a very cool app . this is very fun to play . i find it very hard to put down . i just do not like the in app purchasing .
you get what you do n't pay for . very limited options and not worth the download in my opinion . i was disappointed although i should have expected this .
this game is one of the first games i down loaded to my kindle fire . i play this game all the time .
hope others like this as much as me . i enjoy playing games throughout the day and this one works great !
no . i 'm . sorry this just is n't what i wanted . thank you but no thanks it is just not my cup of tea .
kids love this and so do i. very cute and creative app . gets used year round . not more to say .
really fun . i can sit and play for hours and hours and never get bored cuz they are all different !
bought the hints ... okay . got stuck and bought the answers so i could get past that point , but just more hints ! liked the graphics and it was fun up to that point .
my boys love this game but it rarely loads ! i have wifi at home and it still wo n't open half the time ! it would be wonderful if they fixed it .
this game surprised me . i thought it was going to be lame , but it 's actually quite fun and a good time waster . i would recommend it .
i really love this game but always out of coins and have to wait for 4 hrs . for more free ones .
great game . fun things to do and titanic is one of my favorite movies so i like playing a game that makes me think i 'm apart of it
it is a good app but it did something to my kindle fire and i had to delete it . otherwise it is a good app . you can trick people very easily .
i always like these mahjong games . they keep me busy and i never get tired of them . great game to get .
i love this logo quiz . i know so many of the logos but ca n't place them , and that keeps me going back for more . it keeps me thinking and is n't boring .
i 'm not one for playing games on my kindle or my phone but my daughter downloaded this game onto my kindle and i actually keep going back to play some more !
my 3 children love this game ! i like that it lets you try again and again and again to improve without making you start at the very beginning of the game .
this is an excellent product to teach small children or even adults who are starting out ! i would truly recommend this to all .
if you like mahjong get this app wish it was a little bigger but for free it 's okay . enjoy and can play for quite awhile with all the different levels
i love this game ... omg ! ! ! ! it is the best i have played so far . ca n't stop playing ! no more words come to mind . need to go play now .
fell in love with the first one and fell for this one too , cant say anything bad about this game awesome and free
sucks . not in english . sucks . not in english . sucks . not in english . too bad i could not give it less then one star .
this is additive but fun to play . if you like challenges , you will like this game . it provides hours of entertaining .
this game is so stupid . you just take care of some blue people with real money . and when you do n't play it says your smurfs miss you . # $ * !
this game is great i thought that it would be terrible but is wonderful and i cant get enough of it
i play scrabble a lot with my friends online . so since i am not able to get on the computer or laptop much , this will be a perfect way to keep my friends challenged .
good to get to your pins quick . easy to use and has all the buttons you need to make pins on boards .
i think it looks good just by looking at the cover really cool oh yeah but when i play it i will bet it will be even better
i am not a big fan of the app , it might be more useful if you have a tablet , but still not that great .
it 's not too hard and not so easy that it gets boring . it gives you tips along the way so you know how to play
well i guess it 's fine , but u have to get your own pics from the internet it takes a while to load sometimes , but it 's not so bad i guess
the title says it all . this is a game that is a pleasure to play and to look at . five stars all the way ! !
this game installed , ran , and played perfectly on my kindle fire . none of the previously mentioned problems at all . it 's fun and challenging .
this is an easy way to waste time . fairly easy to understand . good way to work your brain . i would share this with my children .
graphics and sounds are good . it 's a fun game if you like bowling . i play it from time to time .
very fun challenging at some points its easy at the beginning but does get harder you will love it have fun
my only say for this is & quot ; awesome & quot ; looking forward for the next room two . i enjoyed everything about this game ! = )
the game is pretty cool even good for kids but right now i 'm not sharing : ) i do n't want to put it down

i just started playing this game today and i love it . it 's not too hard but not too easy either . it makes you think and has no technical problems so far .
enjoy hours of fun and the graphics are really good . i do recommend this and it is worth the download .
everyone wants temple run now ... this app is a clever trick to get money lol it gave me a laugh . i didnt buy it though
love the cartoon but it is hit or miss trying to navigate or find what it is the player is supposed to get the character to do to move through the game .
i love the game . the only problem i have is see the levels of the tiles at night . i quickly realized i need my glasses changes .
overall great for using it just for the time but if you want to change the way the time image is , buy the add free version
i updated it and know it wont work its a awesome app if you do n't update it it will just freeze : (
all you do is try to get a stupid ball into a hole do n't try it it is really boring and stupid
bring on the updates already . i am getting tired of waiting ! i have all available stars , and i am getting bored .
my daughter is 10 and she likes the speed and challenge it gives her . easy to work will challenge any child with what needs to be given .
this app is very fun and so true it said i was on the nice list and i got a new phone for christmas .
this is a challenge for me since i find the subject matter interesting . i like animals so this is up my alley .
i find this to be a very fun and challenging game ! you need to plan your moves and be creative with your strategy . it is very addictive !
here again i like games that are quickly played when you have just a short time between appointments to play something .

found my printer right away . works as described . i 'm pleased that i can finally print from my kindle fire hd .
enjoy watching movies on hbo . good to have smaller device i use while on travel that way i do not miss any episodes of tv shows . no problems with picture quality or sound . good .

you will love this game ! graphics are good and game is just as addictive as mario on nintendo . good for all ages and the ads are not too aggravating .

i am just getting used to my kindle fire hd and have been adding different apps to it . great service .

if you 're looking for a fun free game this is the game for you . it is fun for all age 's . you should really get this game
i find this game very good . it is really fun . if you like match three games you will like this game .
really fun game ! you must try it ! build a pet shop and get other owners to help you expand and finish your goals to have the best pet shop around !
good time to spend with kids would like more games like this in the free apps section of the kindle
ive almost beat the game ! its so fun ! you have to lock the kindle for it to work . you should get it !
adobe reader has been out for a long time and you should download it so you can read things . it great ! ! ! and i think it keeps your kindle to run better .
like this very much . wish there were more adventures on this game but the graphics are good and it is enjoyable
this is a good game for people that love to bowl and the challenge of it . the pictures are very attractive too . i would recommend it for children as well as adults .
i 'm stuck on a level that you have to solve a problem to get out . so what do you do if you ca n't solve the problem ? stop playing the game which is what i did !
it was fun at first then it lost my interest i like games that are fun and interesting but this game was lacking fun and interest
this is pretty much the same as other games like this , interesting and sometimes really hard to figure them out .
this is a great game . it 's very challenging , like word to word . i 'm having a lot of fun playing word stack .
i can play this game forever ! i love trying to beat my old scores and the screen is nice and big !
this game was much better than expected . makes me wish that i played the first one when it was released . now i am very happy that i was around for this deal of the day .
i get to see every movie that is coming out before it appears on tv . what i do n't like is they keep sending movies i do n't care to watch .
this game is fun and really makes you think about picture associations . when you 're just needing to waste some time this is a good way to go
i dont get this , it is just simple to get draw something . i wish that this would just have draw something
not as easy as it first seems to be . addicting but fast play . puts your brain to work , and this is just in the first level !
i really love this game . if you like temple run then you 'll love this game : - ) this game is also great since it 's around halloween : )
this was a great app . when i 'm bored i can just play this to pass the time . i loved it .
i love the game and the customization you can do to the block and it really works out your reflexes .
i 'm just learning how to use my new tablet , and this application was not one i wanted , good luck to all and to all a good night .
so far entertained but frustrated . like figuring out puzzles but getting lost easily . would like easier way to get multiple hints .
awesome loads of fun ! it 's hard to put down . i enjoy it on my computer also . i 'm just a big kid at heart !
a very entertaining game . unlike whatever you may read , there are no permissions required when this app is installed . give it a try ! you 'll like it !
i just downloaded this app and it does not do anything when i try to open it . waste of money .
love it , very interesting , keeps your mind alert . love that you can play with your friends , and family members , it 's great .
as soon as i saw how big that download was i just deleted it ... .. and i thought that six guns took up a lot of space
this is one of the better shadow quiz games really fun and challenging and the fact that it is free is an even better
great fun . unlike other puzzles , you need to think . it 's a different kind of fun , you never tire of it .
it ` s fun and all but when i am about to beat level 2 it goes to my home menu and the letters are all over the game menu .
this is app has given me no trouble . it 's nothing fancy ; just does what it 's supposed to do . i like that i can have multiple alarms set
this is the game of a life time u just have to play it four your self to get the best feel of the game tell all your friends about it bet that it 's hard to put sons
this game is fun and is perfect for kindle fire . i encourage you to download it . it is also free .
very addicting game , very fun and challenging to one 's thought wave , everyone seems to love the game . my daughter and i keep each other in toe : - )
one of the funniest bingo games to play on kindle . easy to learn for the little grand kids too . would recommend to anyone .
easy to use and pleasant to the eye . tried other calculator apps but this looks better and figures are easy to read
who does n't love solitaire ? lots of fun and entertainment for those long waits at the doctor 's office , or if you just want a no brainer while relaxing .
this is such a neat game . the only thing i wish there was is more movement . the graphics and colors are great . and the fact that it 's free is fabulous .
i have finished all the puzzles and had a great time doing it . will probably get more before too long .
installed it , tried it , removed it . thank goodness it was free or i 'd have been upset . some android phone apps work with the galaxy but this one does n't .
got this for my 9 year old daughter , but my husband and i also play it often . lot 's of fun !
this is a fun game and it makes you think . i love playing this game when i 'm relaxing . me and my wife enjoy sitting together and helping each other figure them out .
it keeps logging me out and for all y'all who say it wo n't let u log on , u just have to update it : ) the app on my kindle keeps crashing and its extremely slow too .
the game is quite fun , although it could use a little more depth . excellent graphics for a cell phone game too .
i really like this app . it does exactly what it says it will and has variety of sounds for you to select from . include the various alarm settings , and it is a very useful app .
i downloaded the free version and wanted to see if i wanted pro , and what do you know i have the pro , very awesome alarm clock .
from the first time i heard this song , i knew i had to have it . it 's such a great song and has a great beat .
i am able to use this while at church and move easily from one book to another . now i do not have to carry my heavy bible .
at first i thought this game was dumb , but know i am addicted to it ... ... i have to get back to it ... .
i am enjoying playing this with friends and family . nice to have a big screen on my kindle to play this game . would like to see more words .
listen to it at home and at work . excellent variety of stations , keeps me entertained and also informed of what is happening with the news ...
it 's a good game . and it is fun but it is frustrating when you have seen the movie but ca n't remember the name !
easy to play and nice options ! its quick and the price of free is great ! the game is quick and has multiplayer options and makes for a fun time !
my son loves this app . it has fun and learning . anything with fire trucks always gets my sons attention and his friends attention as well . i highly recommend this for any parent !
definitely a great time killer ! i wish there was a way to get more coins though . a lot of fun .
i really like this game i would tell others to play it ! ! !
such a wonderful game so many strategies to use a must have game for any time or part of the day
this game is great . the graphics are an improvement from the last game and it is more realistic . i just wish that there would be more than 4 planes .
it is a great game . kept me interested with just enough thinking games , not so hard i did n't want to finish , not so easy that it was boring . i like this game .
this game is great if you love also its got a very good theme and is very fun you will love it .
i like the style of the game and the levels seem to be getting more challenging . great way to relax the stress away .
this game is fun but some of the outfits you can buy for the characters have like a whole bunch of lines going through them .
what 's not to love . its fun and addictive just like the real show . only on the kindle i actually win more ! !
the game is really fun and has a great number of cool weapons . easy to play but challanging when levels gain to a high number
i 've been playing bingo for about a couple of days now and it 's been kinda fun . but i have to say it does keep me coming back
the game is the best . i love to play this game with my friends ! the game is awesome like i said its epic !
love this game it makes you think hard not like any other fun game it is so so so so so so fun .
i use this timer more than any other that i 've downloaded . it is very simple and easy to use , very customizable . you ca n't go wrong with this one .
you do n't get to do anything at all ! ! ! ! ! all you do is bet who wins the match totally completely stupid
i loved it it is so wonderful and different i like how you can create anyone u want so u can make it your friends at school or ur family
this game is awesome because it is challenging and good for your vocabulary plus if you get stuck you can skip it or rate it and get 100 coins like i did
online rpg . fight with friends . only downside is you have to pay for the good equipment . still a great game though .
spider is great fun . i use to have it on my old computer . but my new one did n't have it . now i can take it any where i want . thanks
this is a great game . it has a lot of levels . and you can play with friends . it is super cheap too .
my grandson likes this game , i got it for him . he really enjoys playing this game because he says it is awesome .
my daughter downloaded this on her kindle and she said it 's cool to chat with her friends with this app .
never got it to do anything . i would not recommend to anybody . again maybe i do n't download the apps correctly
this game is very fun . i must say though , the giant monkey scared the crap out of me the first couple times ! the only thing i must complain about is that it seems harder to steer
i like this game because it is just like flappy bird and you can only get it with a ipad or iphone but what 's cool is that it 's like you have flappy bird just on your kindle .
this app works very well with the kindle fire , better than any other sky map i have tried . very easy to navigate and fun .
i do n't know what is wrong with everyone else 's devices but it works fine with me . maybe a force close out of the blue . but it rarely ever happens . i love the app
i have seen many websites o tv , and wanted to find out all about them , and this app does it all .
this is a nice game to pass the time , but i wish you could get to other levels faster . and you ca n't beat the price , free .
it sucks all it is is pictures and it does n't even tell u how to build it or what u need i think in my opinion it is garbage
this is a pretty cool game . there is nothing i have to say that is really bad but the only thing is it can be confusing sometimes
i did not like this game at all , no instructions , i would not download this one again . no thank you
tried it not to thrilled at all and the women 's keeps telling you to relax which makes you not very relaxed . it was free so either way .
this game is so much fun ! since i 've installed it i. have been playing it . lt is no only fun but it is a cute game .
this game is absolutely awesome , this is a game that i can say i 'm glad i bought , this game will go far . excellent graphics and smooth game play
this is a challenging hidden object ap . the graphics and pictures are just amazing . i do n't normally pay for games such as this but i am not disappointed in this case .
i had fun making these cards to my liking ! very cute designs ! i think i 'll be using this often . there are a few very cute designs and i 'd like to see more added soon .
i could n't tell you if this was a good game or not because it downloaded for two full days and then i could n't even play it !
this game is great thinking game . you have to use your head to figure out many puzzles . i think this game deserves 3 stars .
i really enjoy mahjong . this app is great as its easy to navigate . great colors and sounds . i can play my favorite game on the go !
nice app i can watch hbo on my kindle for free and i dont even have hbo at my house .
i do n't understand how this works ! i do n't know if it will cost money to make the server but , i just do n't know
it is like a demo , after a few scenes , it is finished . like a television program with a sequel . it is very short .
this game is by far one of my most favorite apps on kindle fire , but lately it 's been glitchy and wo n't let me play anymore .
i liked playing it what i could but my kindle did n't like it and i had problems getting past the second or third screen .
it is work paying for this app to have it without the advertisements . the kids and i are addicted to playing the game .
it is a great app it may not be as good as the computer version but is still very entertaining
this is an excellent bible app to have on my kindle fire . it is easy to navigate and is becoming my favorite way to read scripture - especially on the go . very good !
this app was unable to sign me into any of my accounts . i 'm very glad i had not paid for it .
i love it , very addictive app that keeps you thinking as it gets harder . and yes as others have said there 's more than 1 chapter .
this sucks most of them look fake it makes my screen freeze and messes it up i do n't recommend getting this
when i first got this game it did n't work but know it works perfectly . i love it so much that i play it every day now .
this is a good app . not the best but good . it does n't work but it is a nice idea . i like the noise and sound that comes with it ! ! !
i am completely in love with this game . it 's fun and it loads quickly . it 's so much fun and you need to get it ! now ! !
pandora is one of the most exciting music stations i have ever had the pleasure of using ! crystal clear music from the genre i love . highly recommend it to everyone that loves music !
highly recommended ! you will be addicted to this challenging game very quickly . a funny game that makes you pay attention to the small details . super funny to watch your friends try it .
fun and challenging and just the type of game that i love . keep them coming they are so fun . thanks !
if you want to try it first go to [ ... ] they have an online version you can play on your computer for free , but it 's not as full as this one .
great game keeps my grandchildren busy for a couple of hours after their homework is done . no homework , no angry birds !
other free jigsaw app i have only included 12 puzzles . this has so many more , and much more interesting pictures .
nothing special about this app . it is the same app that everyone who uses facebook has . i have it on my tablet , nook and kindle .
it is a very very very very very very very great game so get it or you will die today
just could n't get into this one . i got it because i thought it would be nice and creepy , but found it to be tedious and boring .
not as good as the heads up for iphone but still a pretty fun game . only issue is the variety of items in the same category .
kinda fun but not too hard ... i do like word games and this one did fit the bill . not quite challenging enough for me .
version of the classic game of solitaire , it is fun to play . i would recommend this to others to play .
terrible i love the show but this ai n't even the real thing and it is way to short do not download wast of time
awesome game ! ! love the story ! these kinds of games give you so much to do and you really have to think ! well done ! keep them coming ! !
i spend time every day on this game . it takes coordination and brain power . it can get frustrating but i just work against it until i move up a level . very challenging
so far it 's a good game . i hope i keep winning . i do n't have anything else to say . it was a free game .
it is fun to play but it did n't jump out at me to keep me going back to play again .
this is an awesome game that will leave you with hours of fun and challenging levels . plus they have great bonus levels
it 's just like flappy bird ! everyone should get it and play it right away ! ! ! it 's frustrating , but addictive . it 's pretty good though .
thought my grandson would like it , but it had pop ups asking to purchase options , too easy to spend money , i deleted it .
one of my favorite pass times . it is so much fun . i recommend everyone that enjoys the old fashion hand held games to try it is so much better on a bigger screen .
i love playing this game . i never played a game like this before and i am so into it i love it .
it wanted me to go to youtube for instructions ... i do n't want to do that ... it needs instructions at the beginning of it .
have this app on my iphone my favorite learned a lot from this app . easy to use and understand i recommend this to anyone open to learning something new .
not a bad time killer at all . not the best version i 've seen of the game , but definitely worth the download , especially for free
it does what it claims to do . have n't had any issues with it since i have installed on my kindle .
this game is great . the graphics are great game play is smooth and its really hard to put this down .
its not the best at first cuz most of the boring games are there before u buy any new games but once u start buying more games it gets better and fun
this product is great my grand daughter just did it a couple of times i will have to seat down to help her
this app is great you got ta get it first you get a decent hero upgrade the hp and your ready to go
the game is cool in all but u need more characters and rooms and more stuff to do on there
a great app - keeps everything in one place and allows for very easy editing of my life . a definite winner and a must have app
good way to waste a few minutes ... .but once you play for more than that , it becomes boring very quickly though .
this is a fun relaxing adventure game :3 if you like adventure games then this would be a perfect game for you
makes working these puzzles a pleasure since i am a nature person . i like to save them also to keep .
i liked the game but there are so many good ones out there . this is a little slow for me .
another app from amazon free and so much fun to play . trying to continue to beat my own score and love this app alot .
i really enjoy playing this game . parts of it are pretty hard but overall a fun game for me and the kids as well .
this game is awesome you should get it this game is so wonderful i love it you should get it ! ! ! ! ! ! !
love it , my kids play it every day . they think it 's so much fun . looking forward to more great games . thank you
the pictures do n't really show how cool this app is . there are a ton of effects , my favorite being that it can turn your picture into a sketch that looks hand drawn . its pretty awesome !
this is the best game on the kindle it 's not as good as the pc version but its still a great game
this is a wonderful app for all ages . ca n't wait for my grandkids to play it . works great on acer 500 tablet . thanks amazon .
a very nice puzzle game ! works well with a stylus and the pictures are wonderful ! i definitely recommend this game .
this is one of the best slot games available . lots of bonuses and free coins . i would recommend this game to slot lovers .
this game is very stupid . you get it thinking you are going to be able to pay games but each have costs money to play .
i have not been playing long but this is a good game . this is another game that costs real money . it is cute .
please fix this interface . this is not intuitive . i really hoped this was going to be something i played regularly .
i love this game so much . i hope that you will like this game as much as i do . it is such a fun game .
i was about to buy this but when i saw free i quickly got it . can 't wait to play : d
this is a fun game but it stops in the middle of your game so i give this app three stars for that
best driving game i have downloaded on my kindle i play this everyday i always play this game for entertainment
get go it 's a fun game build your car and let her fly many fun events to compete in is new some glitches but nothing to bad a freeze every once and a while
use this app a lot . it 's very helpful while traveling when on vacation . would highly recommend if you travel a lot . there is more information than just gas prices .
grandsons like this i do not understand it and am always getting messed up so i go it for the boys they like it
this is a fun game . it is very addicting . i love the story of titanic and i loved the movie as well . i like these kinds of strategy games , good for the brain
this app is entertaining at first , but it is a lot of the same things over and over again , it 's ok
i really like this slot game . i would rank it up there in my top five slot games . lots of fun .
i enjoy the slightly addictive challenge this game provides . for me , has a crossword puzzle feel with a little edge by knowing most or all the letters to the clues ' answers .
i went all the way through the first time i played . now i get to do it again with everything different .
i collect to a certain amount then i play , it 's slow going . if you have the cash to keep buying coins then it is the game for you
played the first level . very lame . after completing first level froze my phone ( droid x ) . had to remove the battery to restart .
the kids love this little game . it 's smooth , graphics are good , shame you only get one life before you have to start all the way over .
way better than the last one , worth the dollar . lots of features and i found no bugs . can not wait for another update !
so i got the game expecting trash boy was i wrong i would not say game of the year if you have played sticky ninja on the pc or mac ( i use pc ) then you 'll like this
this is a good game and i recommend you get it and see for yourself . you wont regret it . promise
i have always loved crossword puzzles and they are even better when doing them digital . i had enjoyed it very much and actually bought the full version . it does n't disappoint .
you must see good and plenty of fast thinking . it is lots of fun and i would recommend this game to everyone . so get on board with me and let us walk the farm together .
i would very much recommend this app . this is a very fun app . much like a nintendo ds game . hope you like it !
my granddaughter loves this because you can buy stuff and dress her up and you can even get her a pet
i love this game ! it gets more challenging as you go along but never really hard . great way to pass the time .
i love these type of apps and a free download how can you go wrong . if you like this type of app then go for it .
this skype was n't made for kindle so it did n't work as well as i liked so i think found their app made just for kindle and i 'm happier .
so i just downloaded it am i 'm already on level 11 and i 'm 8 and its already fun so wan na have a challenge you found it
the puzzles are challenging and enjoyable . the directions on how to move the story forward are not all that clear . hopefully it will become easier to understand as the game progresses .
usually love bingo but this takes forever to build up coins ... just wants you to buy them ! like others where you can trade , etc .
a children 's game which did not keep my grandson 's attention . i really do n't have an opinion . he did not go back to it after leaving the app .
love hidden object games but this was really not worth the cost . wouldnt recommend if you enjoy hidden word games .
this game is awesome and it is free . this is the best angry birds app yet . you should definitely get angry birds go .
ever since i downloaded this app , i ca n't stop playing it ! ! very fun , and addicting ! if you 're looking for something to pass the time , i 'd recommend this app !
i love watching movies and tv shows whenever i want . the movie selection is awesome and i can watch where ever i am .
this app used to rock . downloaded tons of music and even movies now you cant even watch them let alone download . do n't waste your storage
this game always freezes my kindle fire . the boyfriend always leaves unless your there like every minute . it would be a whole lot better if they would change that problem !
pandora is really really cool ... ... it has really good songs and it is really fun to listen to when ur bored
this game is fun . i like it a lot . the only thing wrong with it is you have to pay to get the dresses and other stuff . other than that i like it ! ! !
this is wonderful now on the go i can check the weather and its good for checking time this is great .
what a great program . eat your heart out , word ! works smoothly with other programs and has everything you could want .
need more restaurants in my area , but good app . even called and they were very helpful in figuring it out .
i love to play bingo so this is the game for me . the game is exciting and it keeps you moving .
have really enjoyed this game . it is easy and fun to play and keeps your interest going for a long time
found this game boring and did not hole my attention . would not pull this one out of the cloud to play it
great but goes back and forth alot . hints are confusing at times . what else can i say ? it was good .
if you have a young artist who is into the ponies then this is the app for you . very simple and easy to understand .
this game would be more fun if the payout was better and you could win more and it would also be nice if you could play bingo on your android !
i only purchased this because candy crush saga was not available . it is okay , but not as much fun as candy crush saga
while a fun game , some of the word associations are extremely odd which then require you to start the game over . some puzzles are fun .
pretty good time management game . it 's basic but challenging at the same time . for a free game it 's pretty good .
i enjoyed this game and the different pictures that made the game a bit more fun . i am still getting use to the kindle fire and it was a challenge to play this game on it..
i got this for my 6 yr old grandson while he was visiting . he really enjoyed it . i personally never played it .
good for keeping track of all ur money and all the things you have spent your money on . good app .
i think this is one app every user should purchase , it helps editing files on the go , but it is a bit laggy on my kindle .
this game is worth it , i just wish i knew more movies ... a lot of fun for those who think they have seen them all
it is fun at first but when you keep doing the same thing it gets annoying . i have n't played this game in a while though .
a very handy , ( and familiar ) easy to use app.i 'm glad i now have this on my kindle , thank you !
i recently could not use this app . without the internet . i have several places i play this where i have n't any internet . i will have to delete it .
this is relatively easy to play . some of the colors in the picture make it more difficult to complete when the background is a similar color . fun and addicting .
love it ! i love being able to stay in touch with my friends via e-mail and taking care of other issues through it as well thanks to this app l am able to do just that .
would n't download tried a couple times so i did n't get to try this one but i probably would n't have bought it anyway because of the price
the game is fun and all but the graphics are bad the good thing is that the items are cheap for a reasonable price
i 'm not really an angry birds fan , so i just downloaded for something different to play on days i 'm bored .
great game . played it on my kindle fire with no issues . the other games by this developer are great also . love to see great hidden object games . keep them coming !
it 's an ok game for what it is . not a permission crazy game like some . simple and easy to play and kills time . could use some better graphics and a little more challenge .
if you like designing than this is the game for you . the only downfall is if you do n't have enough stars you have to wait three to twelve hours for the item to download .
i am sorry this is the worst game to me so far all it wants is for you to spend money
this is a pretty fun game . i 've only played the free version , but so far , so good . a bit easy but i assume it gets harder as you go .
i will repeat what others have said and say that this is a great game for movie lover 's , not so much for others .
i use this app on my samsung galaxy s4 . seems to have all that i need to check my account .
this is addictive and not so easy as it does use logos from all over the world . fun and great for a freebie ! !
this is a fun game that is very easy to play . the replay factor is good . runs great on the kindle fire .
my daughter and i love to play these puzzles . it is still very enjoyable to us and we will definitely keep it for a long time .
i love my pinterest . the app has been fine , i use it frequently and have no issues with it . i am very satisfied .
i am really new at playing angry birds . it is fun and will download the others when i can master this .
this game is so fun ! the graphics are super cute and it did n't take me long to get used to the interface and controls .
i read the reveiws and got the app it is soooo good my little sis always asks me if she can play santa salon .
they want me to rate it before i even could get a chance to check it out . could n't figure out how to get rid of it so i 'm rating it without knowing
could n't get it to do anything , other than to try to get me to purchase something further . deleted it from my kindle .
this is the worst bingo game . you get bingo and they call bad bingo everytime . very cheap with keys and bonuses . i am deleting after this review !
love this game love the little people very cute easy to play look forward to turning it on very fun game thank you
my friend and i have the best of time when we play this .it is a good game and i want everyone to try it
it is a pretty fun game with great graphics ! love it on my samsung galaxy s ii . if i had a larger screen it might be easier to play , but it is a good app .
i rated this three stars just because it is not a game that i enjoyed . graphics etc are nice , levels are challenging it just did n't hold my attention .
this is really fun . very similar to words with friends but it has tasks to beat . ca n't put it down .
i enjoy this game . it is n't my favorite but it does work well and passes the time away ! worth the price .
just started this game , yet so far it is a fun and intriguing game , not the usual garbage that pass for apps or games . i look forward to seeing the rest of it .
what can i say ? diner dash games on any device is great ! i love it on the kindle fire . i would recommend this game to anyone for any age .
this gun app has great gun selection and smooth gun controls and graphics and great sound and picture and guns
i got this for my 7 year old granddaughter to enjoy when she comes to visit . she has fun designing the drinks and decorating the glasses .
this game is fun & amp ; works great on my kindle fire hd . easy to learn , understand & amp ; play . enjoy , have fun
daughter wanted this . downloaded it and no matter what she does it does not work correctly . i would not bother with it .
excellent app ! large , clear display of day and time , and the ability to set your alarm sound is an added benefit .
it is a very fun app ... but i was expecting for it to repeat my words as in the other talking friends ... . still worth it .
i have been waiting for a long time for this game . fun fun fun . i played this as a kid with my parents . now i play anytime . good graphics . thanks y'all
works well on my kindle fire and stops others from using apps i wish to keep private , like contact list , email , etc .
great game to pass time while waiting for appointments . i like that there are many different layouts to chose from .
this game is very fun . i would recommend this game to an adult and or child . it 's also very fun to play on tablets .
it is awesome . and i can get it for free . i recommend it for any age it is very challenging also . you will get addicted .
so far its fun and not too hard will see how it goes as get further along ... good time killer when nothing else to do
is fun and easy to play but it did an update and i had to start over from the beginning . lost everything .
its a good app but it kinda seems little kid like but idk its kinda fun but its hard too
this app is easy to use and maintain . this is much better than a paper list that you carry around and then lose ! !
had such hopes for this app but it 's not ready for prime time . hopefully they will be able to fix the bugs . it is so convenient to watch from my kindle .
this is not a & quot ; done in an hour & quot ; game . hard enough to keep you interested but with a little patience and thought easy enough solutions .
it really only has a few games unless you purchase the full game , no body wants to pay for games .
great game with a lot of hidden objects and puzzles . i felt like a detective ! humor in the storyline is a great plus !
like my title says it is a must have ! i love how this app . it connects you directly to the product so that you can purchase them . and updates everyday .
i have bejeweled 3 on my computer and loved it . this one is great on my kindle fire . i enjoy playing it very much
just wish they 'd come out with a new set of challenges more frequently than once a week . it 's fun to play with others !
i really love this app because it does n't freeze up and it 's really easy to use . it helps me through out the day .
my daughter ( who is 2 years old ) absolutely loves this game . it teaches her colors , letters , and animals all while doing puzzles ! wonderful app !
it is a lot of fun and it 's challenging too ... i highly recommended paying it is you like puzzles and stuff like that
i am not a big fan of any type of this game , but this one is sure cool . i would recommend this one to anybody . nice job .
i love this game ! ! ! ot really is like playing the real arcade game ! ! the puzzles are cool as well . if i had enough grabs i could play all day ! ! !
another good game to keep me occupied . i like the fact that there is a story and each step is part of a bigger objective .
so much fun . accidentally found it looking for other apps and downloaded it just because it was free . i 'm glad i did . it is very challenging but great when i get a new element .
the levels are not so hard that you ca n't figure them out . nor are they so easy that you get the level in a few seconds . more levels would have been much better .
i love the bible trivia game . lots of fun and educational for all . i would have paid for this game it is worth it .
i got the free app first to see if i would like it , i did . it 's a great game , grandkids love it also .
this game requires a lot of skills and it is very tricky , but ca n't seem to put this game down . really like this game . : )
it 's addictive . it gets really hard after a while . i have several types of games like this and this one is the best .
i 'm still learning how to work it , so that i can get the best music that i like . but i think it 's a great thing . i love the whole idea of it .
i play this game with my granddaughters . i play it when they are not around even more ! all of these story games are fun . i would recommend these to anyone .
this app is so much fun . you have objectives to try to complete . you get achievements to get . and there are daily bonuses ! this is a must have app .
i like this game . its fun and addicting . i have n't had any problems yet . so far this game is cool .
i wo n't give up my email & password , possible scam , for something i do n't want ! if i wanted to pay for an app i would just choose one that has a better record .
this game takes alot of concentration . keeps my mind going . it is great . everybody can play it . keep the levels coming
great app to get books organized . i have mine setup into multiple categories so i can find them easily . very helpful program and very intuitive ! ! !
i like this but i am too slow in my answers , yes would recamend this to friends . fun , makes you think
i thought that it did get boring after a little while but the game was great in the beginning i think its still a game that all ages can enjoy
i 've been waiting for this game to come out for my kindle fire . my sister talked about it so much for her ipad . i love it and it can be very addictive .
if i need to purchase items in the app it is not a free game . free means free ! please stop with paid games as the free app of the day . it 's old already .
this has been a good game . i have spent many hours of entertainment with the game . all the games i have been playing this is just as good if not better .
seriously ... the more you use this - the more you will like it . has to be used to appreciate it . i now put it on all of my devices .
i like it it 's fun it is a good game to play you should play it . you should buy it now .
this app is great ! i have found some really great deals here ! keep them coming ! i look just about every day for an awesome deal to steal !
what a great and simple concept for a game . i highly highly recommend this game for people of all ages . 5 stars .
installed on my fire and it is very fun . it 's not hard to earn the points to unlock the other games . i would recommend this game to others .
there 's no way to move past what you ca n't guess . you have to keep on searching until you find the answer , gets frustrating .
this game is fun because you do n't know what floor your gon na get in the end and it keeps your mind busy
it crashes a lot . it says it stopped working ; wait or force close . i wait but it never starts . you have to force it closed .
i enjoy this game and it reminds me of words that i can use in the game & # 34 ; words & # 34 ; . it is a learning tool for the brain .
this is a pretty decent game to play daily . the only bad thing i have to say about it is it takes way to long to get swords and you really ca n't get very far without them .
the app is very addictive . i play this game every time i get on my kindle fire . it 's a great game for being free ! !
good graphics and lots of action . a very enjoyable game on the kindle ! download it & amp ; give it a go .
this is a great app and has n't let me down . i enjoy many stations depending on what i want to listen to . i find this app very easy to you .
same review as the above games . you are frustrating customers with too many ads and risk the loss of kindle lovers
this app is very easy to use . i 'm happy with it . it will get a lot of use from me .
this is a great brain work out . difficult and challenging ... both of which are important for exercising your brain . i encourage anyone to try this game .
this came in handy during nemo . i downloaded it and it had live updates from all over the states that i watched . love it .
this app is really fun and cool to have . i like the different types of sand in the application . it 's just fun .
it starts out easy but then it gets harder . just enough to make you stop and think of another way
sweet app of the day , doors what it says . you can convert old photos that you have . ca n't complain other then it 's a little slow but still give it a five star rating
i had a hard time putting this down and taking care of the house . it is a fun game that makes you think but relaxing at the same time .
this reminds me of playing the real game at the fair . just realized you can sell the prizes for more tokens !
this is an awesome app ! ! it helps me when i have to get up in the middle of the night ! get this app and rate it 5 stars and a good opinion !
what more can i say ? it is sudoku , a good way to pass some time . only get it if it free .
i think its good but , once i deleted one world in minecraft it kept giving me this notes saying & quot ; can not open & quot ;
fun and relaxing game . i like how it does get challenging towards the end of the month . graphics are good and it is easy to play on my kindle .
great story line for hidden objects ! which makes many objects to search for under the time line . ca n't wait to see what 's in store for me to accomplish !
this game is super fun and cute but it freezes and does n't click at certain times but other than that really good
i love this game it is easy to play fun and you can meet new people you do n't have to wait long
i love this game so much i would recommend it to everyone i know . i 've always wanted to be a princess .
awesome it could n't be cooler . i love this so much it makes my pictures look so much cooler and better than they are now .
the eye hand coordination is awesome i have to really pay attention keeping up with everything i love it so much
i deleted this game after playing it only once . it kept freezing up and is hard to play on the kindle fire . i would not recommend it .
very helpful for me since i do n't keep track on when my next period is . this app just does it all for me and is extremely helpful . glad i got this .
this is a lot of fun to use and the horoscope is accurate on sometimes . worth the download because it is free .
my grandson like this he says it really helps your brain . it 's a little too hard for him but he tried . he likes the game .
i love this game , its original ( amazing in this day and age ) and just plain fun . i play it all the time ! !
i like this app , but i do n't really use it b/c i have one on my phone that works just as well .
thus us such a cute game that any kid can play . my youngest plays thus on her own without worry of ads . i think this game is really fun
clues are pricey and often not helpful . i love playing though . seek help on facebook if you have patience . often friends can help .
new to candy crush , but very similar to other games . learning to like it more each time i play . thanks !
i have been waiting for forever for this app and i 'm so happy its finally here ! its so easy to use and i suggest it for any fashion fanatic !
this game is fun but not exciting . its a hit or miss . give it a try you may like it .
grandson loves it . i do n't play it but it keeps him occupied for a while . not a game for me but good for him .
i was charged for this puzzle but it would not load would like game or a refund on my account not installed
i like this game just wish there was a way to pass if i ca n't get the answer . but it 's . fun .
it 's ok but i did n't use it as much as i thought i would . i 'm sure someone else would enjoy it better .
decent search game , with some other interesting puzzles , and enough goals to work towards to keep it engaging . but amazon 's word minimum is lame , for the record .
i like it but it gets boring . it makes me stop being on my device for a while . i hope you at least try it . it your choice not mine
very fun and a very short learning curve . picked it up today on amazon 's free app of the day ...
this game is so much fun , i ca n't stop playing it . if they keep coming up with more temple run games , i 'm going to download those too .
very addictive game i have had a hard time walking away . i love that it has so many levels . would highly recommended playing .
very cute game ! have not played it long , but am enjoying what i have seen , so far ! thumbs up ! thanks for the game !
block story lite ia an awesome game . best on my kindle yet . what would make it better is if you could save . i am planning to get the full version . i highly reccomend it .
graphics are awesome and the puzzles are challenging . i definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes puzzles and a great storyline .
for some people they might like this game but as for me i do n't like it at all . its just not my type of game .
challenges your thinking patterns . be ready to laugh at yourself . fun , fast paced and definitely addictive . great to play any time .
this was my favorite game until they updated it and now all i get is forced close . tried uninstalling and reinstalling and it still wo n't work on my kindle fire .
this is a very fun game ! ! i wish we could play without the coins . but i would recommend this game to anyone ! ! it 's fun to see your weekly ratings too !
it 's fun so far . i did n't quite understand the way the game is played but it 's simple and a fun way to kill time . no complaints as of yet .
i like it ... fun to play ... some thing different and i enjoyed it ! thanks ... good game .
fun and addicting although i wish it was more options in winning free tokens . but i still love the game any way
my granddaughter just love to play this gave , but we are having a problem with getting it to work right now . it says it need an update .
thought my husband would like this game as he likes to hunt and likes to play games on the kindlefire . he played it for 10 minutes and said it was stupid . deleted from the kindlefire .
fun game for all ages . great game for a time killer . easy for anyone to use . i did have something it did n't work right .
i thought a lot of the topics were super vague . it 's not a lot of fun when you do n't feel like you 've got a fighting chance .
love this game . between this one and seasons , i like rio the best . playing the other versions has made it easier to play rio .
kind of hard to catch on , but when you do it grows on you . got ta be fast to get ahead
no problems with it and i loved . it 's price wish some of the paid . for apps . worked as well as this does
my two year old niece loves to play this app on my kindle because it shows her how to play songs she knows ! i also enjoy it !
great ! works great ! i need some more words to fill up ! wow this is a lot of writing ! two more !
i love being able to see family friends , etc pictures . meeting new people while playing bingo , slots , read a book , search the internet . and so much more . fun
fun and you can guess an you can guess things and you can use hints which is really fun and cool .
i have more than one version of solitaire . they are all fun to play . my grandson enjoys this one on my tablet !
this angry birds release starts easy and gets more difficult as you go . good addition to the angry birds library .
lovely game . plays very nice and the different tile sets adds an extra element to enjoy . quest is nice and classic has multiple layouts .
really enjoyed the game until i figured out how limited it was . but guess what ? draw something is in the appstore now ! ! ! ! ! ! : d
seems to work great and you can see the exact percentage in front of you at all times . good app .
i find it difficult at times but enjoy it . some of the harder photos really make you rack your brain .
excellent game see my previous review of this game , you wo n't go wrong if this is your favorite genre of strategy gaming .
the calculator is a calculator after all . however , i expected more features and skins for the extra 99 & cent ; . the basic features and scientific features are offered in the free version .
this has been a long time favorite on my computer . the graphics are excellent . glad i can play it on the go .
who ever rated this game 1 star get a life . the only reason i did n't give it 5 stars is because you cant move forward
it is cool an fun but warning needs wi-fi to play other than that it works great an looks awesome on my kindle fire
well worth the $ 5 , but i wish it were longer . i would . definitely buy the number 2 version if they put it out .
this is like the only app that lets me hear all the music i want right from my head phones . its so amazing just enjoying your music .
i 'm so glad that i down loaded this game ! it really is a lot of fun to be playing ! love it .
fun and bright colors that even little kids can play with . it is easy to use - i would recommend .
finally i got this working on both of my kindle fire hd . i am having a little bit of a problem switching users inside the application but i am very happy that this app finally works on kindle !
this is a free game , and it helped to kill a couple of hours at work . what more can you ask for ?
it is not as good as it says it should be . gift for family member and they do not like this product . can not hear person on other end very well .
great hide and seek game for young children . she enjoys looking for all the animals and loves to play it .
it 's cool having a variety of music choices to suit whatever mood you are feeling . i 've used it quite a bit just to relax .
very well done , so interesting to play and give time away if it has some extra boring time . a a a a
this app is not very good for the kindle . what the kindle needs to go is just a volume control to the side of the kindle like the ipad .
really fun game and it gives you free coins every hour so there is no need to spend real money . the mini games are fun . i really like how the game themes change every game .
not really a lot to say except it works well and i like a good game of solitaire at times .
all you can do is try it , yes at first it is hard to get used to . however once you get it then the real fun starts .
this is so much better than the old one . more options for words , being able to save . wish they would have added a few more brush choices though !
a very good touch and click a bit short but a very enjoyable couple of hours but i 'm glad i did n't pay for it
the only bad thing is you have to pay for netflix but that regular do n't know why people are giving it less than 5 stars
definitely worth 99 cents . this game is a ton of silly fun . love the sound effects and graphics . too cute .
not too bad . it is pretty fun but than gets old fast . my five year old loves it . i still play it when i 'm bored .
fun , especially if you like variety ! unlocking more is enjoyable and they are just challenging enough without being too hard .
love the game and this one is fast and really fun . i play it on my new kindle fire and have a ball !
if your bored this is a good app . but it is not a challenging game . at least next time i am the fair i will win at this game
still trying to figure this one out but is a good logic type game to keep your mind going so i recommend it highly
am just finishing level one . know it is going to get more challenging . i like this app companies games . straight forward , easy to use .
after i figured how to use it with the icons and reminders it was great . its the only calender i use now .
not sure the deals are close to the human deal . hard to win it seems . but okay to pass time .
love how this app has lots of challenges and that 's its free . if i were you i get this app .
i saw it 's movie and reviews and it looked like an awesome game . then when i played it turned out to be a easy to play hard game that was really just ok
i have a lot of fun and challenges playing this game and i love the colors . it is a must have for everyone !
this is the best one i have found so far . there are some words that do n't match the category you are looking for but that makes it more challenging .
i like this app because you can download more puzzles than the basic ones . you can choose how many pieces you want the puzzle to be broken into . great app !
not that much fun ... there are a ton of poker and card game apps out there , and most are more fun than this one .
awesome game to kill time and a great strategy game all around . better than any village building game on kindle .
i tried to download the free app but its trying to charge me . i never buy an app without trying it first so i guess this will have to pass . bummer
i downloaded this app and played it a few times . i really have n't played it much since i downloaded it . gets boring after a while .
i love this game on my kindle and it is totally awesome i recommend this game to anyone who wants to take care of a family .
i have tried other gin rummy card games and they were terrible . this game is fun and challenging and has the best graphics around . you can also set the difficulty level .
my son did not like this , it was very frustrating to him that it would not set up correctly . if anyone has advice to help us figure it out that would be wonderful . thank you
i love city building games . this is one of the best . i play every day , a few times a day .
i love this app when i first saw this on my friends ipod i did n't get the point but when i got it , it was addicting and fun
really have fun playing this game . it keeps you entertained for quite a while . hours of fun . lots of coins to win
i like the convenience of wifi , and on demand especially if i miss a program its just a wonderful feature
cute fun filled game for all to enjoy would recommend buying it , my grandson and grandaughter are really enjoying it
i really like this game , but i find it very hard to play with just the free coins . i guess i 've just not been lucky enough to hit a big one to play longer yet .
i just knew this was going to be the free app of the day soon because the original quell had already been one . yay ! i love amazon !
i wish it would let me play more than one card just starting out . kind of slow right now . all in all a decent bingo game . how exciting can bingo get .
its a waste of space and time . it is literally a stupid test do n't waste your space on the stupid app . ( which is what this dumb thing should be called . )
i really , really enjoy playing spider . a friend said it 's more fun than playing regular solitaire and i totally agree .
this will help me a lot with the different classes i have at church . it will help if i become teacher eventually .
i thought i knew television pretty well , but i was stumped at the second level on a show . i could n't believe it . this game is not as easy as you think it will be .
what more can i say ? it works as advertised . i can check my balance anywhere i have a wifi connection .
just wish you could play against other human opponents for better competition . love to play in person as well . a fun family game .
this game is awesome there are some problems but there small like loading slowly the tutorial is really helpful and good
i like this type of puzzle . i like that you can also move tiles around to help solve the puzzle .
enjoy trying to figure these out is lots of fun for time spent . the different difficulty levels adds new challenge as well .
great fun game to play its a great game to play to kill time or take your mind off life
this is a really fun game . i love the challenge of each new level . i would highly recommend this game to everyone .
after playing for about 15 minutes , the game will not allow you to go to the next level until you pay . advertised as free , what a rip off .
this game is great . addicting ca n't stop playing you need to try it . you won ' t want to stop playing
i love this game . can not play it enough . hats all the ads ... .but love the game . great free download . get it

it 's like fruit ninja ! this game is great to play and i 'm loving the challenge it presents the player . all in all a must have app !

i love this app . it is amazing and i am going to recommend it to everyone . thank you app developers ! !
this game is awesome and just like the real tv show .i think that everyone should get this game . the best game ever
it is a good game that makes you feel like you are in the casino . would like to see more frequent payouts but all in all all good game .
so i get really sucked in to this great game then i got ta pay another $ 5 to keep playing ? seriously ? !
fast spins compared to many other games . good graphics . four hours for points a little long . just started but lots of fun .
excellent customer service and great product . will buy from again , great price . cant believe how fun this is for the kids . love the free apps ! ! !
i liked the game , some of the words are impossible to guess , but it 's old fashioned fun and a great game to keep you busy ...
just ok for me , a little slow but still fun . i still play it every now and then . it 's ok
this game is free on other devices but not kindle ! i hate when it is like that . i mean it should be fair we should get games free too !
got a little tedious after about a half an hour . guess i am not what could be called a gamer .
i like the idea of several short , easy to learn games ... would give it 5 stars if it did n't do so much selling .
i 've always wanted to learn to play piano and this app helps make that happen . i totally recommend , two thumbs up !
love this game you have many hours of fun puzzles are fun i ca n't wait to load the next game . keep up the great work
i really like this game . it keeps you constantly thinking . there are many games like this . out there however , i think this is the . best .
this is a great game for those who like to use their heads . some puzzles are harder than others but they are fun and i would recommend this game to others .
talk about using your brain . this game can drive you nuts and that is the fun of it . love these games that make you use your brains . recommend this to everyone .
not liking this game . i 'm going to uninstall the app . it 's boring for me . i would not recommend this game
someone help how do i know how many coins i have i have got 12 achievements unlocked and i can buy anything for 15 coins ! ! ! otherwise it an & quot ; ok & quot ; game
fun and fast , always moving , many ways to win . i 'll challenge you to play bingo run and see for yourself .
it was okay . it would be a lot better if it was n't for all the ads that keep popping up . very annoying .
not worth a dollar . not realistic , not entertaining , just took up space . even the boys were not interested . i kept it but it is never used .
very nice app with a unique approach . it has a good tutorial to help get you up to speed . fun and entertaining . looks very good on kindle fire .
granddaughter really loves this app , i would like to be able to increase the skill level but she is enjoying the app .
this is a fun temple run type game . it is a bit laggy on kindlefire and has a few issues however it is worth getting and its free
the mahjong genius is a fun game that i enjoyed playing . it is very easy to learn how to play .
i like this game so much i am not a big fan in puzzle games but i like this one you should get it
a fun and different slot game . give it a try for yourself and see what you think . has different levels that you play
i really love this game . the scenes are just so beautiful -- i love that . it is fun finding the hidden objects - some are pretty hard to find . very happy with this product .

my daughter has been learning french and i have been doing the spanish . we love it . highly recommended . very addicting .
this is a lot easier than trying to circle words with a pen or pencil -- -- and the words are not ordinary
i think this is a very fun game and that everybody should have it . the monsters are cute and also look cool .
this is one of those games to keep on your device in times you are bored and want to play something where no thinking is involved .
it gives me the current temperature and the forecast . i can also get a clear hourly forecast with just 1 touch .
this is alot of fun to play on the kindle fire : ) it 's a shooter game , but not one of the boring ones , it 's pretty fun !
awesome game very additive graphics are outstanding just wish it did not speed up as quickly as it dose but fun none the less and really like having other characters and the power ups are fun .

great game ... keeps you on you toes ... requires you to think outside the box . but this does not mean it is not fun ... fun filled hours : ) ) great app for kids
once it hit level 24 it got crazy hard . its a fun game for sure ... it makes me want to keep playing to beat my high score . get this game ... totally worth it .
this app is great . not only can i listen to radio stations across the country but i can also search for specific talk shows and it will give me a list of stations that are currently playing them .
never would play keeps saying newer version click here would never work very disappointed in this app ! lost many hours trying to install and uninstall multiple times to get it to work it is useless
i really like this bible it is so easy to read and study with and with it being on the kindle it is ready any time any place
overall it was a good game i thought it was a bit short . i loved it because i love hidden object games . i hope the next one is better .
super amusing game . skip the free app . just go for the paid version , if you do n't you will end up getting it anyways . very addicting .
so far i like the game . as long as i can keep playing without spending money i will . keep up the great work .
very fun and adicting . seriously , when u start ur eventually gon na die , then ur gon na wan na beat ur high score , and ur never gon na get off ! overall : great game .

hours of games , so many to choose from , i enjoy the double deck version , choose number of cards to draw
i love this game . i play it all the time on facebook and now i can play it on my kindle ! !
a great game to play to pass away the time . challenging but not too frustrating . definitely the type of game you would like to have to occupy the time . and it 's free !
it 's fun i would n't say it 's the best . most of the songs are relatively new , some i have not heard of .
i like that i can play my friends on facebook . cool graphics and sound , plus challenging levels . very fun matching game .
monster galaxy is so cool i ca n't stop playing i love it sooo much i wish they made more games like this one
love to play by myself and when help is needed the family ! good fun for all who play any ages and great pictures !
this is not a stable app . it really does n't make much sense to download it . good for little babies maybe ! !
its so stupid it does n't even work an add comes up so i press x and it brings me to my home screen
i did n't pick this one , my grand kids did . so i could only give a two star rating ! i do n't know anything about this game .
i could sit here and pass the time wit this game and it 's easy for my kids to play to
it does not help you spell at all . i see no purpose for this ap . nothing more to say . im done .
its a really fun game . i always make my pictures black and than the colors look amazing ! please try this app .
the kindle fire hd was a gift for my daughter who loves to read and draw . i got this app for her and she absolutely loves it and has created some amazing drawings with it !
hello just wanted to say this is a awesome game . this game is addictive . so if u like playing games on your computer , tablet or phone try this one .
like the different number to play and you can pick your own numbers to the bonus games are fun to
i would play this game all time it 's really fun i recommend it for sure good game ! passes time and is fun to play that is hard to find on a kindle trust me ! lol
easy to use and i do use it all the time . i enjoy being able to use it quickly when i have a hard time finding my other calculator .
great way to practice for church bingo . four cards keeps it going fast , start with two and then go up .
my sister watches disney a lot . they kept advertising this app . it is very addicting . you only get a few rounds to play . after that you can rest start the app or buy the full version
this does n't even work , it just tells you to delete all your stuff so the coins can get into your game . what a lie ...
words are easy to find but they do n't like to highlight easily . the touch is a little slow to respond .
best game ever i love this game ! it is so much fun lol i love love love love love it so much !
it was the first game i purchase to use on my new kindle . it was fun and easy to learn as there are several types of solitaire games to play .
it is ok and i enjoy it . i like being able to show my kids how to do it and therefore is a teaching tool .
a lot of fun for the few minutes you can fit in here and there . cute graphics . different tasks . not for younger children as tasks get complicated .
love playing the game but hate that it shuts down in the middle of a game on my kindle fire
besides having to download the extra data ive had a wonderful time playing this game . im pretty addicted to it right now so yeah . enjoy .
i love it it is so awesome and fun ! if i have nothing to do i get on my kindle and i play happy jump
the ease of the game and the challenges are great . wish it would n't use up so much power . only drawback is that you ca n't save the game your on at any given time .
this game is not too challenging but it is entertaining . hours of enjoyment for all levels . even the kids can play !
this game is so fun ! ! if your bored than just hit this app and you wont be bored any more ! ! !
i found this app to be much like candy crush . great for my 4 year old too . easy to play .
loved these puzzles . great way to work the mind in a different way . leave a comment and unlock new levels .
this game is very fun somewhat similar to angry birds but with guns instead of birds ! the only real down side is in the free version you do not get very many levels but it is very fun
why not get one app that does both work as a timer s well as a super alarm ? i like the variety of sounds as well as the ease of operation . five stars !
not really sure at this time.i have n't gotten the hang of it yet . may be i should ask my kids .
i love this game , especially because its about killing zombies , which i love to do . i just bought it and it 's a little complicated , but i 'm as actually getting the hang of it .
i like the game but the bird goes down to fast if you never played i recommend it so you can get the experience
my little girl likes this when it work . for some reason the kindle will go black and you can hear it playing but you ca n't watch it .
a great way to spend some relaxing time ... as well as , a way to keep the brain in shape ... this is one everyone should purchase to help relax and keep the brain in shape
this one is a keeper my three year old grand daughters love this app . easy to use and easy for them to navigate ! ! !
this game really takes out stress when you kill him and i really like the update with take a picture and make it a boss really cool get the game .
bought for my granddaughter , not too much time before extras needed to be bought to continue game . was n't that interested .
very fun and addictive . i think i like it more than angry birds . i cant wait for more to be released .
really was n't what i was looking for . i just wanted a thing to list books and movies but this was to much for the little things i wanted to use it for .
nice game the only problem i see so far is you ca n't skip the ones you get stuck on you are just stuck . do n't have facebook so ca n't ask them .
i really enjoyed this game ! it really makes you think ! this is one of my favorite games ! i love it !
i like the game ! hours of fun ! the payouts are great ! i recommend getting this one ! the graphics are awesome , feels the the real deal !
this piece of crap wont let me log in and i keep re trying to log in but it does n't work ! ?
love playing this game on my kindle ! its fast and easy and i will never go back to the card version again !
this is a fun game to play . i love the new updates that the game did . i like how you can level up .
i always wanted to learn how to play backgammon . i play it at least once a day . i love it .
i usually like to do word search when i do n't want to do a lot of thinking . it is something i do when i want to do some down time .
i dont like the fact that when you play there are still options for more words but it will say that you have used all your four letter word slots .
nice change from the first one . very nice . always earn the most . very very additive . i will be anxious to see the next one .
best game ever ! i play it all the time with my little baby brother : d yay ! super good get it !
fun and relaxing game . i love word games and this one is different from all others . if u like word games try this one .

if you like bingo you will like this game . it is very addicting . it is a big time killer and a time waster . it just like all the other social bingo games .
i like the free version so much i plan on getting the paid full version . i also have the french and chinese versions .
it 's okay . i could do just as well opening my phone book to a random page . but the price was free - again something about getting what you pay for .
if you like fruit ninja you 'll like this . it is very similar but has some additional challenges . graphics are good , works well and is fun to play .
game play is smooth and winning is fun and easy . bonus cash pops up just enough to keep you playing .
lots of fun challenging entertaining a plus one of the best scramble type game for kindle i have found . would recommend to all who enjoy word games .
i am a big fan of word games and this one delivers . a lot like text twist . bonus games are fun too .

its colorful and there are levels . i try to get the best on each so i replay until i do . three match with different obstacles . get it !
fun and addictive mind work has always been a great time passer for me . i really like this app . it has alot of levels and gives you good mind concentration .
i got this for my 4 year old granddaughter & she really enjoys it ! i try to get games that keep her interested as well as teach her something and this app seems to do both !
i love it . it keeps me thinking ! gets my mind every once in awhile . i really enjoy it ! it can be tough .
it 's enjoyable , but the directions for a beginner are very vague . i 'm glad it 's free . i do n't spend any money on it . i 'm willing to wait for more lives .
i realy like this app i want to be a pop star when i grow up i love the app
i personally love this game .if u are a person who likes virtual people games this would be a great game for u .but i love it
this is a pretty fun game . really simple for quite a few levels but it eventually picks up . it was free so i ca n't complain .
i guess i am to easily bored with some of these games . they just do n't live up to my expectations for enjoyment . i did n't move to more challenging levels .
i really enjoy playing this game . it keeps my mind fresh , and also i find out how much i do n't know .
this app is a great way to communicate with family and friends when you do n't have a phone and its free . i would recommend this app .
this game is a lot of fun . it helps me cook food and serve it . i like it a lot .
this is an awesome app . i did n't even know how to draw like that until i got the app . i think u should get it .
this is all my daughters play and my son even me and my husband play it we all have seen the movies
i did n't really like this game . tried playing spider solitaire , but it did n't have any options so i deleted it . glad it was free .
you should get this app it is really fun plus its free sure there is ads but it is still fun !
i really like this ! it helps out so much to see my account whenever i want to . it does exactly what i want it to do and it 's worth it .
i love hidden objects games . this game is great . i downloaded on my kindle . it 's free and very entertaining . game not quite long enough for me .
i truly love any game that has to do with penguins . it is fun fun fun and i would recommend it to others
as long as you are looking for a kids game it would be fine . if you are looking for fun beyond age 3 i would pick a different game .
this is a game i played long ago . it continues to be exciting , challenging and interesting . it is a short game to play when i only have a few minutes .
it 's an okay game . sure some of the levels are harder but they should defiantly have more levels than they do cause i got past them all in under a half an hour .
this game is fun . and kid friendly . if you have facebook you can upload your children 's photos for family and friends to enjoy . love it .
i like this app very much . i can check my local weather without going to my computer or the tv .
i really do n't like it . hard to understand & to me it 's boring . i guess it 's up to each individual .
this app is awesome but i wish the one with world war 2 weapons was free . as i said before the app is awesome ! !
best weather app ever . right way more often than not . i check it out all of the time.. most reliable .
my 10 year old loves this game . she has several games on her kindle fire . this one is here favorite .
i really did n't like it because it only showed facts and not cheats about club penguin so i did n't really like it .
i enjoy playing this game a lot . the only draw back is having to purchase extra bubbles all the time .
waste of money . bought game last night , & amp ; beat it this morning . it is fun to play though . just stick with the free version .
i like the puzzles , but they get a little repetitive . it 's fun . i would recommend this app for people looking to use up some free time .
why does this need so many permissions ? it is just a game . well i downloaded it because it was the free app of the day then became scared away due to the permissions needed .
purchasing was easy . addicting game ! saves your levels when you die . allows for use with current figures or simply play . great time killer .
let you watch the show you like on family for free - do n't watch too much - just when trying to kill time
i hope they keep making these 4 pics and logo puzzles cause i take them every where i go . if i get stuck my whole family helps
a challenge for sure . love puzzle games . different backgrounds and love the options available for the object or word . my grandchildren love to look for the picture .
im a huge fan of any music trivia or name this tune type game . song pop is one of the easiest apps i 've tried so far . i 'm hooked !
did n't get to play . live where cell phone signal is usually very weak . too bad too cuz it looked interesting .
been playing a bit and enjoy it okay . i will continue to play and hopefully enjoy the game the same .
i really like the game ! ! the only thing is there is no music ! ! its hard for me to play apps without music !
grandkids like this , but it 's ok for an adult . too easy in my opinion . they play it , i do n't care for it .
this game absolutely gives me a headache , but my daughter ca n't get enough of it . you can do more things with this version vs. the free one
this app works wonderful on my kindle fire ! ! ! ! ! i hope that you enjoy it as much as i do . it is the same one that i 've enjoyed for years .
color and decorate the nails is fun and entertaining for the kids . a good way to learn and be able to practice for the real nail art .
candy crush saga is my favorite game ! i play it every day and so do most of my friends . it is very very addictive .
after about an hour of use the scenes were repeated ! ! will there be more scenes added ! ! ? ? pretty boring after you go through all of the scenes ! ! !
it may be me , but , i could not get it to work on my kindle . if any one has suggestion please comment . thanks

i ' v played this game and instantly loved it i recomend it to people who love dragons and hunting who does n't
i really love this app - so many mahjong puzzles are too small to really see the tiles , but this app is great
i have been playing for months and i absolutely love this game . for a free game , you ca n't beat it .
it was n't what i was looking for . yes it is free , but you have to buy the full version to get things done .
one of the better games like it alot fun to play challenging like the graphics in the game as well
it 's fun and creative i like it soo far it 's not easy but it 's not very hard so i would recommend

love this game . the graphics and sound effects are fun . lots of challenge levels that holds my interest . i like it more than some of the other similar games .
this game is highly addictive and entertaining and good for all ages . my only complaints is that there are so many options and versions within the game that i do n't know what any of them are !
great entertainment ... my husband loves it , he comes home from work and plays he says it relaxes him . great for the whole family .
i recommend this game to anyone who loves sea animals ( or eating them ) i would love it if they added multiplayer .

waited forever and it 's finally . love this game sooo much and it is really addictive ! suggest this game to anybody who is a somebody ! get it because it is amazing .
first i get the news on a timely basis and then the application works like it is supposed to be . never crashes and it is very intuitive to operate .
this game looks totally ridiculous ! i mean why the heck would you make an app like this ? it looks super stupid ! it could possibly be a time waster but still !
good jokes ... but there is a limit to the # of jokes you see a day . unless of course you want to buy it .
great for keeping you busy - good eye exercise . its fast and quick ! just great for a time filler . thanks
i want to give it 10 stars because i love this game and finished all the levels . please make more games like this .

this app is amazing ! you seriously need to get it . you can buy most of the stuff and those through the items . and the mystery boxes are epic ! seriously though get it .

it 's so much fun . and can play against friends . easy but not too easy ! and love that there is more than one subject

i have played similar games but a freebie is fine with me . as addicted to bingo as i am i am always looking for new game .
this app is very stupid even a real dj wo n't understand it not even your own parents wat a rip off
i only played it a couple times . i found it to be too boring so i deleted it from my kindle .
it is great for your mind and keeps you thinking . it is also great for older people to keep their mind sharp !
i love this game it 's epic ! if you like word games than you 'll love this ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i recommend it to my mom and she loved it too .
this game is so annoying . every time you play it ads pop up . it 's a dumb game do n't waste your time downloading it .

i love this app ! i know it 's only an app but after taking care of them for a day or two you 'll really start to love your little monsters .
ran out of points too fast and ca n't play . will try it again later but it was fun while it lasted .
i highly recommend this game to play it is very fun and time consuming i be playing this everyday when i 'm bored at school or at home
always keeps me playing for hours . i really like all the games , they are very fun and addictive . i would reccomend this to all ages .
do n't waste your time find a better app . junk ! would give less then 1 star if they would let me . just stay away from this one .
i have been playing this for a while on my evo . so glad amazon got this so i can play on my kindle fire . one of the best grid puzzles apps i have played .
this game is pretty fun , and the game is addictive . on the other hand , it froze my kindle . whatever you do , dont get this app !
if you are looking for a good game this is your game it is a good game to make time pass by quickly get this game
did n't like it , did n't feel like instructions were clear enough , so i do n't play it disappointed as usual in some of the games i purchase
if you like slots that are competitive with others this is your game . however it was hard for me to get enough coins to play one game after another .
when you need a quick pick me up , this game is a lot of laughs . trying to get the stuff to hit the guy takes some stress away !
this app is very fun to play . also it is very much like the logo games . i think this is fun when you sit down and have nothing to do . very very fun game !
this is a great game that i really love playing . my 6 year old loves it as well . i think it 's a great purchase !
it 's got good graphics and i love that you can use your own images for the cards and the background .
i was first introduced to the game by my cousin . i hated it back then because i was no good at it . now that i can play it , i love it .
fun game and very challenging . not as easy as it looks . like the fact that you can go at your own pace . . . no timers .
this is a fun game , but it can get a little boring sometimes . but , you might think different . so you an go ahead and get this app , but do n't expect much .
this game really works your brain by making you think ! decent game , but glad i did n't pay for it . i have n't had to use too many cheats , good thing because they are expensive !
i am stumped . the game does n't go any further if you do n't know the answer .
would be a really fun game but it has way too many annoying adds and you have to buy a full version .
this game is so fun and all kids should like it because you pick your way and decide how you like it
i think it 's really cool and it is a lot of fun , especially for kids . i love all of the color and that each picture you make is unique .
i like doing puzzles and this helps me pass the time . a great variety of puzzles and you can choose how many pieces you want .
this is the best app ever . everyone should love it what a great game it is the best . best ever
love this game . very additive . ca n't stop playing . would recommend . great graphics and sound . interesting story line . you 've got to try it .
i had been a fan of mahjong for many years , i just got my game today and i am having a great time playing this game ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
the graphics are well done and it 's fun to play . no issues with the app on my kindle fire . i do wish the instructions were better written , but easy enough to figure out .
great game with a lot of opportunities . you could run through different areas and have fun ! i think that the game should offer more coins .
it is so cool i almost play it non stop . if you 're looking for a game this is it ! never regret getting it !
for a free game , it 's okay . it 's something different than the regular mahjong i have on my computer . but wo n't complain as it was free .
this game is really fun i play all the time it 's really fun to play if u r bored n it is great to keep it kids busy
i love this app because it helps me focus on the one who is always present yet so easy to miss . i recommend it to every one .
i play this game a lot on my pc so i am very happy to find this app . it 's just as good - if not even a little better than the game .
not exactly easy to figure out in the beginning but much better when u have it all set up . decent buy .
this app is so cute , especially for cat lovers . i was surprised by all the different things that can happen to tom , not to mention the sounds that he makes . too funny !
this is a fun and easy app i like the way you get 4 chances at guessing . it makes it easier to choose .
you can get it if you want , but its not fun . you can do pretty much two things and nothing else . the pictures seem nice but the game is boring .
i do n't know how to play the piano , except for one little verse of one little song but this piano is a fun toy
love , love this app . it is much more enjoyable playing this game while waiting in an doctor 's office etc . also keeps the brain working .
this game is the best game yet ! i love it . my little brother keeps begging me to let him play it .
i did n't really use this product so i ca n't say whether or not it 's that great . for what it 's worth , it 's just like yahoo messenger for your pc ...
it is ok but some times this game does get really boring some times but it is some times better then cutting up real fruit
again being locked out of the game in only a short period was not fair . game was a little crazy
solitaire has always been a favorite of mine . this is easily understood and relaxing to play . anyone can play it .
since there was nothing i could do to make this work , i removed it . neither pictures nor pieces ever appeared on screen . ? !
it is a awesome game but it keeps shutting off but i really do love it i think u should get it
a nice break without having to get too complicated . quests are usually easily completed even if you are n't connected to & quot ; friends & quot ; .
this is a really good game to play . would like to play more games like this one . play it you might like it .
i love this game and it works great on my kindle fire hd . i used to play on my iphone , but i love the bigger screen and it 's easier to draw .
a little hard to switch back and forth from across to down and hard to view in terms of size on a kindle fire ... .but still lots of fun and a good challenge !
it seems that i can not comment on your app.i have to be over 13 years to comment on your app .
this game is very fun and awesome for all ages . the only problem is the game glitches a lot . other then that , get this game ! ! !
connect kindle candy crush saga to facebook and you can play this game to keep up with your pc version .
i thought this would be a cute game for my grandson to play at holiday time , and even he said it was slow .
this game is fun . its a good game to waist time with . i recommend it for you . get this game right now ! ! !
i can download the game but after the game will not load . the game looks like fun but its a waste of time .
i am enjoying this but have to admit that some of them give me a little trouble but i will get them all solved before the year is up .
i love the idea of the bill reminder but it does not have what i needed and it took forever for me to figure out the app . i just got another one that is better suited to me .
what a great game , i love playing this ! ! ! ! ! i wish more games like this could be included for free play ! ! ! ! !
is incredible . i do n't know if it is my internet connection , but it gets kind of glitchy . but it is awesome regardless .
this is one of the first games i downloaded , and it is still my favorite . it is so simple and very addicting . a must have !
this game is not worth the time to download or the waste of your good storage space for this game
it did not work for me at all and made me mad . i thought i would be able to watch these movies . i guess not
i have been playing backgammon for 30 years , and i love playing it . beware though it can be very addicting .
in the beginning i really liked this add , but after installing and running virus software it hit on this app . so to be on the safe side removed it .
like i said before the bible is awesome and should be advertised more it is super awesome and a great way to spend the day on it
since the last update the app goes to full screen ads and therefore i ca n't do anything with it . i liked this app but now i hate it !
it helps my memory i just love a challenge . as i age sometimes i tend to forget a little . it is a great game
this is a great game to play i always go back to it i have some trouble with logging in to facebook and getting the deals to show up but i still love it
i think that it froze everytime i moved something and it is a waste of time and it has to many ads
but crashes optimus s. sent email to devs . so disappointed my family is missing this one . one of the best christmas movies ever !
this app simply makes it easier to delete other apps . there is no need to read instructions . it is intuitive . it 's not necessary , but i like it .
waiting rooms are not so bad anymore -- - ! my kids & amp ; i play this while waiting for anything ! ( we love our kindles ! )
because of the good reviews , i wanted to like this game . it never did quite download on my kindle fire . tablet froze .
enjoyed this game . it was not the usual hog . no problems playing on my kindle fire . big fish again turned out a fun game .
i do n't use this app very much because it is not as good as i would like it to be .
it 's facebook on the kindle . the format is a bit different than when you access it on the web , but it is facebook .
i like to play bingo and it is fun . it 's nice you can choose how many cards you want to play .
excellent , excellent , game and i might add a great app for the kindle fire hd . there 's no way to explain why i liked this game . keep up the good work .
i looked at the photos and all the movie pictures are easy ! this game is fun , so that means ... ... download it !
maybe if i would have given this game a chance . maybe i am sick of these type of games . i played it for 15 minutes and deleted it .
i love this game and for me it 's glitch free ! ! ! and it 's appropriate for girls 10 and up . and it 's free so try it out .
very fun . challenging levels . app works well , no lagging . graphics are good . fun upgrades to see hotel come to life .
i read the headlines every day to keep up with what is going on in the world . it is a quick way , and i do n't have to wait on the information .
i like this sudoku app . the color makes it interesting , and i like the way you can enter notes in the blocks .
i like this app because it has all the pinball from when i was a kid . it works fine and i love it .
this game is very interesting with good puzzles to solve . the pictures are beautiful . really glad i got this app . hope there are more like it .
it is a fun game . a little diffrent than other matching games . great way to burn some time . i 'll keep playing
was able to doctor up photos and post them via fb . and more all from my kindle . its worth the five bucks .
this game is addictive and very hard . i can not even get past 3. this game should be a little bit more easier .
my daughter downloaded this game for free and is very happy with it she plays it all the time , yeah
fun at first but after a while it gets old , some icons are repeated and some are just impossible until looked up
this game started out fun and as we sit in the level of 30 some it 's still entertaining for the family to play . would recommend this one if you like match it type games .
great way to spend spare time . i play it several times a day . my 4 yo even likes trying to play it . great for older people and kids also .
it is so much fun and when i am bored i play it forever ! it is pretty epic . i recommend this app to anyone who has nothing better to do ! : )
this game is like farmville , it 's okay , but it makes u buy things with real cash . i 'm actually just making this review so i can get free crystals .
really cool game the cars are great the tracks are are nice to and the way you custom your cars is really nice i really like it
this game is the best ever . i was waiting for soooooooo long for it to come out on kindle fire and it finally did and i 'm so happy
most have been easy but when you get stuck you really get stuck ! i like the challenge but wish the clues were easier to access . all in all worth it though .
freezes up then when lets you play it only is couple of times then wo n't let you play until full game is upgraded so im not going to keep it not worth money
every so often i still get those annoying ads across the top of the page . what is the point of paying .
i love this app ... it works great and one thing i love about it ... is that when u set an alarm it tells u how long u have till it goes off !
this game so far is very different than the other escape games i 've played ! i 'm excited to see what happens next ! i definitely recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a challenge and escape games .
my kids love it ! they are 7 yrs old & 4 1/2 yrs old . it seems to be very popular & has good reviews .
was worth the price . loads of fun . had a good time playing this game . we could n't put it down ! ! ! ca n't wait for the sequel
i think i 've play this maybe twice . for some reason i just ca n't get into it but maybe sometime i will .
it downloads quickly and it is just as easy to access my email on my tablet as it is on my laptop .
this is good to have on the kindle it is very easy to read and easy to look up what ever it is that you need to read .
this is great . having this app to watch shows on the go , gives you chance to be out and still catch a show .
it isnt really the most fun game but it was alright ! maybe you could make a little more hints so its easier or show more popular brands .
much better than the one that comes built in . i love the widget options . very handy addition , and worth the money .
i guess extreme means going off 15 minutes late if at all ... also most of the time i have to take the battery out to turn it off - uninstalling
this is a great game for sure . the only bad thing is the adds . other than that its really nice
my daughter loves the game . its very entertaining because it fits to the age of the child . i would recommend it to anyone .
this game is fun . have been playing for 1 day . i only wish you did n't have to wait so long for energy .
great app , i can look up any category i want and get the most recent stories on a moments notice . i like it a lot .
i just started playing but am enjoying this game . you match words & amp ; colors . sounds easy but it can get challenging ! definately a workout for both sides of the brain !
this game is a little tricky but it makes you feel like you were on the titanic when it hit its death .
im always looking for fashion type games and this one is the best ! i like the variety of things you can do and the shopping !
this is a must have audio or not . many of my friends who gets a kindle fire for the 1st time , i recommend this book . the price is worth it .
i use it for everything . it makes things easy to store and easy to organize and easy to find a month later .
i really like the game . i find it easy enough to just do this for a little bit and it does n't take up too much of my time .
i love this game . it 's so much fun . it is something do do that is easy and fun . got ta get it .
i think it is a fun game i like how it shows you all the homes you broke . i do not have any ads yet and hope not to get any
i have spent a great deal of time with his game . i have been enjoying it and not getting much done . it is a great game .
i really like this app . my grandson loves it . i hope you add more music and more variety to make the app more enjoyable .
i have n't played in it such a long time , but i do recall being entertained for about a month . i recommend it .
great for my five year old daughter but is only one story to color so when it was done we had to get rid of she does n't want to color the same things over
game was great on my 8.9 kindle fire , except for the fact it quit working occasionally . i would restart it from the start page with no problem .
i have this app on my kindle fire and it works great ! i havent had any problems with it , very additive .
this ap is among the ones i consider a mistake . there are so many others that work better . perhaps others may like it . i suggest reading a positive review . someone must like it .
love it , but can be addictive ! some levels are harder than others and can be frustrating . but overall a great low key game
this looks like a runner game for the younger generation or if you like temple run and things like that , you would probably like this game
this game is simply awesome ! ! love the pc version and the kindle version is just as good . thumbs up guys
only played a little while but cant put it down this game is great i hope i do n't have any issues with it
at first i rated it as too simple but i had n't realized that there were a lot more levels of difficulty . it is a fine game
this was a great game.i had a hard time putting it down . i wish it would have had more rooms . i finished it in a weekend . this game has some pretty advanced puzzles .
i like logos quiz better because this one is too easy my 9 year old son can play this game with no hassle but good game other than that
i like the game but i do n't like writing these reviews . can be tough . some pictures do n't make sense . i 'll figure it out .
this game is addictive . i do n't have a lot of down time so picking the right game to help me relax is important . this game fits the bill . i really like it .
something good to focus on when bored or waiting for something like an appointment or just need something to keep you busy
this games graphics are great . its a lot of fun . the third one is a lot better though . a a a a a a a a
this is a simple to use alarm . i like how it works on my kindle fire hd . i needed it for an early morning wake up on a few hours of sleep . it worked great .
this is a good game . it would be easy enough for a child to play and yet is interesting for adults .
clean master is a great app . it helps me keep my kindle fire hd running fast . this app does exactly what it claims . and does a great job of it..
this is a great game to pass some time with ... its like 3 mini games in 1 ... its a definite great game to buy
it 's very hard to move or edit items . every time i try to move or edit something everything else pops up first , especially if they are close together
okay but level one is too frustrating to advance beyond . would be very annoying for a small child or older person with vision or hand control issues .
this app has worked very well , great quality streaming videos . if you have netflix , then this app is a must .
all the kindle fire hd word games available for free were less entertaining or challenging as older kindle or kindle fire versions .
slow going and a bit boring . just not that much fun to play . i erased it after three chapters played .
this keeps you updated on the games and the scores been very good especially if you ca n't watch the games and wanted to see what the score is .
this is one of the best bingo games i have played , and i have played quite a few of them ! ! !
glad it was the free app of the day . play about 5 minutes before deleting . if you did n't get it as faotd , do n't waste your money .
just downloaded a few minutes ago , but so far i love it . i 'll do another review in a few days .
i really like this app it works great and my son loves it . the only problem with this app is that the voice . my son does not fell good about that .
i love this game ! it is very entertaining and my 3 year olds likes to play too . i only wish it did n't require neighbors to complete tasks .
will never try it again , it is just plain dumb as a rock to waste time on a stupid little animal that never seems to get anywhere .
i have been getting hooked on bingo lately and i do have to say this is one of my favorites if not my favorite . try this if you like playing bingo i think you will like it .
i got this app for my daughter who is almost 2 & amp ; 1/2 and she loves it . easy to use and no problems with the app .
i was excited to get this game , but it would not work , it kept getting locked up and i had to even shut down device and restart , other games work great - do not waste your money
the game was a little pricey but had great graphics . there were several times it froze or just quit when playing it on my kindle fire .
i started playing and though it was very easy , now i am stuck ! this is a fun , family game . i am really enjoying it .
when you spell ( not spell ) the way i do this is the best way to help me out . it does help .

it has been fun learning how to use this new app as i learn how to use my new tablet .
i hope who ever made this game might not want to make kid games they should awesome and fun games
i 'm still on level 1 and i am lost . i can usually get through these games pretty well but i do n't know what 's going on lol

i also have this on my ipod touch too and it is so fun to play in the car or at home
do n't really know what they want you to do . it looks interesting but not clear what is needed to complete the game .

i love mahjong it is a great game and i love the different levels it has . i am so glad to be able to play .

about the same as the facebook game ... nothing special ... just started and is a bit boring like playing with others does n't seem to be that way in this version .
you will get stuck playing this . it 's really great for passing time . just about like the original tetris but with a faster pass and power ups .
challenging in higher levels but doable . the graphics are simple and nice . i find this to be a great way to unwind .
i really enjoy this game , always wanting to get perfect scores . i think anyone should purchase it . where 's my water ?
this game is fun and challenging . works great on my kindle fire hd . i would recommend this game to anyone who is up for a challenge and the characters are really sweet .
it has cute people . and also can be challenging . if you like sims games you will also like this one .
interesting challenge type of mahjong which involves several steps - plus 100 layouts with background and tile sets you chose . also have a section to play continuously . good game .
i have a new kindle fire hd , every app works wonderfully , facebook does not . soooo slow ! just use the browser on your kindle . it is faster .
this app is a total waste of time . it does nothing but crack when you touch it . do n't buy this game !
my little girl was so disappointed with this app . she could n't do anything that did n't require her to unlock - spend money - something .

my daughter talked me into getting this one and i am so glad that i did ! it is so challenging and fun !
great app to download . helps you to figure out a good workout when you do not know what to do . have a video that shows you the correct form on how to do the exercises
i think it is good because its not the fake piano tiles and it is more challenging than the fake ones .
this is a fun app , very simple to use . when you 're bored it gives you something to do . very user friendly . easy to work .
i do n't love this app . i just personally think its stupid . i mean lil its crazy . the title happy poo says it all . do n't get this app
the game 's got good , but , it has to be free of charge due to it 's simple gameplay although , it does have a good story .

this is the worst calling app around text now is more recommend cause you can call and text so rate this 1 star because you just enter a number of your state and you do n't get to call anyone
but not as easy as you 'd think . some are pretty difficult . i think we deserve more than five & quot ; coins & quot ; for each correct answer though . all in all pretty fun
solid app . well designed , clean , and informative . ( thirteen words to meet the twenty count minimum . sometimes short reviews are better . )
it is called a smartphone for a reason . this app is not needed . thanks but no thanks . just use a regular task killer .
i just love playing this puzzle game . i would highly recommend this game to anyone who has a android phone . my son plays this all the time .

it 's a puzzle game but really fun ! everyone should play this awesome game ... this game is really exciting and hard but fun .

i just recently started this game , and so far it 's a great game . once i get more involved in the game i will give another review .
uninstalled dance fantastic . did not work properly . been a long time but remember it did n't have things i would use either .
you can play as long as you want to put it down and come back to it . a nice break for the day or evening .
quite useful for editing pictures on kindle . nothing too difficult , really simple interface and controls , and you can write on pictures which was what i was looking for .
my daughter likes this game because she gets to choose the makeup to apply . she would like to have more free color options available .
this app is a favorite of mine . i find it easy to navigate & amp ; explore ! thank you for creating the portable program ! ! !

i am really enjoying this bible app . it is a really good way to start your day with a quick read .
i love this , first of all you dont need the font stuff , so dont worry about that . this allows me to use it and type up documents on the go .
i like the interface . like that you can count down using seconds , minutes , or hours . simple and does the job .
a really good simulation for deer hunting and other game . it 's only downside was the fact that animals could fall through trees .
it 's ok nothing exciting about it . it does help the kids with their words but otherwise a bore . i have books for this .
my husband and i are enjoying watching it and the tv and keeping track of it all . thanks for creating it .
enjoyable game with great graphics . puzzles are doable once you figure out what you need to do to solve it . recommend it for those who like hidden object games .
i beat all 10 levels in about 45 minutes . i really enjoyed the game but they either need to add more rooms or make them more difficult .
you are able to see all your history channel favorite shows . wonderful to have an app such as this . other channels should follow suit .
great game for keeping your mind sharp ! ! ! graphics are great as well : - ) i recommend trying this game , it holds your attention , at whatever pace you desire ! ! !

the subject line says it all ! ! i had a great time using this app . only wish there were more levels ! !
i wish you could do all the things on the pc . on here you can only do so much . other wise i luv it ! it 's so cool
very simple little game , maybe a nice game for a little kid , but i have no little kids so was n't worth me loading .
this game was actually pretty fun . from the pics it looks like its not fun whatsoever but it really surprised me .
but a bit slow to work on my kindle . i do n't think i will try it again . there is n't nothing like putting a puzzle together with the family helping out while they hang out .
i found the odds to be very realistic and the advice button is a good tool for those just learning the game . even the table makes you feel like you are at the casino . well done .
this game is great it is addicting and fun it has a reward system that keeps you playing and having fun
i really like this game but it crashes on my kindle fire all the time . i have to back out and reload at least 3 times per game .
enjoy the levels in this game . it was entertaining and fun . i would recommend to everyone i know . ca n't wait for the sequel .
this works great the way you 'd hope it would . use it - enjoy it - love it ! now somebody please solve the adobe flash issue !
simple concept . hard to put down once you start playing . a good stop and go game ( waiting room time waster ) .
google has helped me many a time when i get stumped and need some answers . it is really a great app .
very fun but all the good guns cost real money and to beat the harder levels u need those good guns

i enjoyed the music and it was fast paced . very addictive , as i kept wanting to see if i could improve my score .
fun sounds and easy interface . a fun twist to bubble popping games and you do n't have to race the clock . love it .
love it hours of fun will tell all my friends and family so we can play together . and have hours of fun
i loved playing this game . it was n't that hard to follow but it was n't real easy to play . about the time i got lost the hint that was given put me back on track .
i like playing the game but when i try and do the challenges i ca n't finish them . when you do n't have friends that play you ca n't do the challenges in neighbors .
fun to play when it does n't freeze up . seems to happen during play and you lose without playing to end of round . since i play for fun it 's ok
i loved it ! this was my first game of this kind and i had a good time with it . it took some time to catch on but i found it was a pleasant way to pass time .
way too many advertisements . i certainly would not recommend it to any one who just wants a free game . nope .
love this app . works great on kindle fire . my kids love it too . keeps you busy but to advance quicker , in app purchases required .
good app : ) i like this app i like how you can translate it too it is a good app
omg , this is way different than flappy bird . but it 's still difficult and challenging , hope this helped . it is really fun though .
just discovered these types of games and i have been thoroughly enjoying them ! some of them are easy , some are harder , all of them are entertaining .

after i had my son i would be up all night with him , and i would be playing fruit devil until i fell asleep !
love the game ! very hard on some levels but you keep trying and finally you get it . hard to put down .
my daughter ( 7 ) downloaded this game and she seems to like it , do n't know that if it has any learning value .
love this game it is so much fun trying to find all of the items . they have hidden them very well . great job
good for the type of game it is but nothing special . would n't had gotten it if it was n't the free app for the day .
if you like spot the difference games , this one is fast and challenging . graphics are wonderful and the photos sometimes difficult . works great on the kindle hd fire .

this is just as good as the version for my pc . very easy to work with and no problem . all my contacts just popped up . thanks yahoo ! !
i get the same amount of news from google news , so it 's ok. there is a lot of information available .
a lot of fun for a simplistic concept . just right to make it fun yet still be challenging
my granddaughter loves to play this game when she comes to spend the night with me . she is only four years old and really gets involved with her game .
this app works well and if you like old shows and movies , it gives you something to watch , on tv , for free .
got this game for kindle fire and was amazed at what the device is able to do as far as graphics . fun game .
the only reason i 'm not giving it a 5 star review is because it is kind of simple and gets boring but if you 're looking for a good game then it is pretty fun and addicting
this app is absolutely amazingly easy to use . there is no way yahoo could of developed a better app than what they have .
i have n't got it yet but ppl alot ppl saying that its bad or good so i 'm gon na give it a try
first game that was challenging but also yet able to complete . tried them all loved this one the best ! ! ! looking forward to the upcoming levels !
that is a great game to get your brain working . i love this game and i hope that everyone plays this game one day .

i am not even sure why but i love this game and once i start playing i find myself losing hours of my day , just all around fun
i love playing this game . it is so addictive i play all the time . i cant stop playing this game .
game has good graphics . it is a pretty short game and the ending was n't what i expected . not the best click adventure game but for the price it was ok .
great game that 's definitely worth the price . i ca n't stop playing . the levels get more and more challenging . download it now you will not be disappointed .
i just cant get enough of this game . it is so addicting but in a good way . i wish there were more apps like this one . great game
it is an ok game to play while you have time to kill . it will get you thinking at times of how to solve that puzzle .
great app ! works great on my kindle fire ! ! even better that its free ! i had absolutely no problem with it at all ! !
boring boring boring boring boring and did i say boring ? this should not even be under the category of a game ! and did i mention that it is boring ?
i play a lot of this genre and this is one of the best . no glitches on my kindle fire . just enough ho scenes to get stuff . no trouble downloading .
temple run is a great game that has plenty power ups and upgrades to unlock . this game is hard to stop playing . its very addictive right from the start .
fun game and i play it for free . addictive and oh so easy to play . fun for all ages and i highly recommend it .
wouldnt purchase again my daughter had fun with it for a while but got boring after a few weeks of playing
it is fast moving , able to adjust bets to how i think the game is going ( not that i get it right ) . i play it often .
used it a couple of times then deleted it ... ... not worth the space it took . does nothing google wo n't do easier .
this is a good test for your memory . i really like it . i need any help i can get . some are so familiar , but i ca n't place them all .
i just downloaded jewels & amp ; diamonds plus and started playing for over an he . it is addicting . easy to play .
did n't hold my interest like i had expected . okay for occasional playing when i am bored of other games and i want something else to play .
just started playing an ok for being free . doing a review because they are giving me free hearts . had no problems with download or opening the game .
my sister wanted this so i said okay i enjoy the app more than her i wish some of the hair stuff works better but o well
i love dogs and i love jigsaw puzzles . so , this app is just right . i would highly recommend to anyone who loves dogs .
good games within the game , but wish it would enlarge more during ho . fun to play , but you do need to figure out the different rules . like this one ...
i did get this app , but have not downloaded it as of yet . so i can not give an honest review of it
i only went to the web site once . it is alright but it does n't give the live news like i thought it would . i 'll keep it for now .
my kids love this app , they really enjoy the theme and all the options . they are learning in a fun game setting . learning is n't `` boring '' with this app
i like playing solitaire but the ads are annoying ! there are times that i want to remove it but i do like playing it .
i love it but it is very addicting . some are very fun and easy , some are not . still have n't figured one of the cities out . another one having problems with but will keep trying .
i enjoy this app , but there is only so far you can go before they are trying to get you to pick another app like the one you just enjoyed .
this game is a lot like bejeweled . it 's fast paced and fun , but like many other reviewers , i find the ads after every game extremely annoying .
i am so excited that it finally came on kindle fire . i love it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! awesomeness . and fun . yay ! la la la
have to set a time limit otherwise i would never stop playing even my family plays whenever i let them which is n't much .
i am so so happy i downloaded this game . it gives me hours and hours of entertainment . even my kids love this game . you 'll never get bored with it !
this was a neat idea and i like to download movies , just wish they would add more tv shows to the list of downloads . that would have been great to catch up on shows during my flight .
this is a good game for strategy and figuring out puzzles . you have to review and like to get free hints , but that 's ok .
this is a really fun game to play if you want to kill time , really makes you think . and it 's really worth the price . works great on my kindle fire
it 's okay but i have others i prefer . there is not a pause , so you can not deal with interruptions . the tile colors are very boring ,
fun and easy to pick up . challenging game play , but not so much so that it is annoying to play .
so far it has been fun ! i liked all the options you could have such as picking different background etc .
this product is okay . i might recommend it to others . i thought that there could have been more content to choose from however .
i enjoy the game , but , it is a little difficult for the grandchildren . keep up the good work with word games .
i really like this game ! something to keep me busy while watching tv ! not too hard and yet is still addicting !
this dictionary is fast on the kindle fire , does n't require a network , and is accurate . i do n't see why it is n't used more .
i just wish it was longer . it was a good first game and i look forward to the next one .
i love this app . if you are a runner , this is for you . i 've enjoyed the free version for months now . get this free today , even though it 's worth the ten bucks .
rummy mobile was okay . it took too long to play . difficult getting started and rules difficult to understand . would not reccomend .
so far i like the game have always been a smurf fan . the game is fairly fast paced and has great graphics .
my grandkids play this one too . i do n't see them on it as much as the dinosaur hunter but they do play it
if you like room escape type games you will like the game . if you want extra levels you have to buy with coins .
i like playing this game its challenging and lt lets you continue playing until you advance to the next level , you do not have to wait like some of the other games to get lives back
it was a two step process to search the internet before the google install now it is a one touch app and faster time as well .
was hard to get her to hit things , timing seemed to be off , got rid of it so did n't my daughter and granddaughter
i chose this because it looked like a fun game , but once you 've played it , it 's not the kind of game you keep going back to play again .
here 's another game that you do the same thing over and over to get more energy to continue the game . boring !
i love this game it is a good airplane game , you should get this game right the second your done reading this review .
never really used the app much ! the few times i did it worked pretty good ! i need up just installing it !
no issues with this game . doesnt freeze or stick . doesnt ask for cash to continue to play . i love bingo games . very pleased .
challenging game options . lots of game time . can replay without becoming easily bored . i have played f or several hours and still have multiple puzzles to beat .
kids and & # 34 ; big people & # 34 ; love it , too . fun for star wars fans and angry bird fans . fun game for all in the family .
i like other games better . not real easy to navigate . i like jewel quest solitare better . play board is simple .
i have never played this game but my daughter has i think . i 'm not for sure if she liked it or not . she likes most drawing games so i guess she liked it .
have the mac version on my ipad and could n't live without it on my phone .
cant rotate the pieces no matter how many times i tap the pieces . i. want my money back . do n't like . it . when i. get charged for junk .
everyone needs to try out the ai apps . i find them very intuitive and entertaining . i could play for hours .
i love playing this game . a lot of fun pictures and keeps the mind thinking . my son and l love playing it together .
that 's all i want to do is watch , but it want let me watch them . i do n't no what i 'm doing wrong .
no problems playing on my kindle fire . story is interesting and graphics were good . this is one game i 'll keep and replay .
this is my first kindle game and so far it 's just what i wanted : an easy , fast game to exercise different parts of my brain .
wow this app is awesome ! i wish there were more games like this in the world ! the app icon is cool to !
this is a great app for kids , but not so great for adults . it gets old fast because it is very easy to do .
i have no idea why you people are saying this takes up space and freezes ? ! ? ! ? ! it does n't ! ! ! have a nice day . = )
my kids love this app and they have learned a lot from it . i would highly recommend this app for toddlers .
i have had no problems with this app . works very well on my kindle . i had tried a couple of other youtube apps that did not work at all .
my cat enjoyed it at first but got bored after a few times . amusing for a while and made me laugh at my cat . worth the 99 cents
i have played this game before in the other version . i enjoy playing it , it 's great to spend time away from the daily work . i would recommend this game .
this was my first hidden object game . i enjoyed playing it for a while , but there are other games that hold my attention for a longer time . it 's a nice game to return to occasionally .
love this alarm clock ... if your like me and press snooze in your sleep this is perfect for you . you can set it to make you answer math questions before you hit snooze ! !
this is a terrible app it is way to fast pace and has no controls this game might as well be made from a two year old do n't waste your time like i did .
long , complex game with a good story line . so much better than the other hidden object games i 've played .
great soundtrack and gameplay . my only complaint is that is has very few levels . other than that its fun and free so get it !
this is a fun and easy game . it takes fruit ninja to a whole different level . good for all ages !
the only bad thing , really is the fact that you have to buy hints when you want them . it is fairly good though .
this was not worth the trouble of downloading it . i know that it was free , but someone should pay us for ever trying to play these games . i would not recommend these to anyone .
i like this game . you can ask friends to help when you get stuck . some of the puzzles are a little tricky !
i love this game its fun and adicting ... but you get sick of the same tracks but i would still suggest getting it
i love it ! ! i do wish you would get a version of candy crush too . this games plays well on the tablet .
i cant seem to stop playing this game . it is really really really fun to play . my kids love to play also .
they only give you a few free games and those are all small boards , but they are a nice little time killer .
i love mahjong , i even play it on pogo . and its in my favorites . one of the best games out there .
the game is pretty challenging . it sucks you in and ends up addicting . very fun to play with friends and family or alone . it makes you think outside the box ...
weird animal combinations but fun to try and figure them out . really a challenge when you do n't recognize either animal .
the game is awesome . i love that i can do it with my family and figure out the logos . i think that every one should get this game .
i like a game to be challenging but when you ca n't pass a level after playing for 3 days -- -- -- its not fun any more .
i could n't see what titles they had available , so it was n't worth downloading it 's crazy that you ca n't see what to purchase no point in downloading it 's a waste of time
no other app or game has ever shut down or take so long to load for my kindle its great to play but it sucks that i cant play it much maybe 5 minutes a day if im lucky
this game is so stupid but i love it so much . it is do addicting and i can not stop playing it .
this game was free for my kindlefire . it is a lot of fun and something i can play with family , even grandkids like it .
the game is fun but i get too many pop up advertisements between levels . the add said it would be ad-free when and how do i get the adds off ?
i had this game on my android and downloaded it onto the kindle for the kids and they absolutely love it ( i do too ) .
awesome list that is . this one is a keeper . it holds my interest on the bus and other waiting places
great game so far will continue to play to see what happens . will let you all know very soon how i like the game and if it 's worth playing .
i like to play dice games and yahtzee is ok , but the other two games would n't work so i deleted it .
this is different than most games of this type . you get coins everyday . never seen that with any other games . great way to kill time .
love it . happy its finally on kindle cant wait for the rest of the king apps . i cant get enough .
i play this game on my phone and it does great but on my kindle fire it keeps stopping and making me force close it . please fix this ! will change rating to five star when fixed .
our 2 1/2 yr old granddaughter really likes puzzles and these are right up her alley . she has worked them over and over again .
i enjoyed playing this game . it was fun and different from anything else i 'd ever tried . very entertaining . thank you for the fun .
this app is a rare one where you actually have to think to try figure it out . i loved the fact that the riddles are n't so easy that it 's basically just wasting time .
helps practice your game for real life . it is a fun time filler when u need to kill some time .
i am retired and this is a great thinking game . my grandchildren also love to play this game . i play this game all the time .
does n't really compare to other apps such as animal planet , a & e , history channel but some folks will like it anyway .
just for fun to have . checking our scans and see what it all means around us , and others to see
oh my god . i love this app so much and i ca n't believe i waited this long to finally buy it . but i hate when it tells you that you 're out of lives . : (
this app is very bad . it has bad graphics and you might as well buy the real cut the rope . its worth the 0.99 cents .
it 's a awesome app . i enjoy it because it is rather challenging , more so then the other logo games i play . i rate it a four n a half out of five
i hate this game . it is the worst game in the world ! i hate this game i just cant stop saying how much i hate this game .
the game is was okay . i did n't enjoy this game very much . it was n't as they had described it . i did n't like it .
i give all apps 3 star when they dont work on my tablet . it did seem like a great app which is why i downloaded it
it 's a cute game . also easy for my youngest to navigate and play without having to read anything ( he ca n't read yet ) . love the cute little animals too !
cool game i like the sounds cause they are really awesome and funny . you should get this app because it is cool
this game is really fun and addicting . i recommend this game to anyone who has a lot of time to burn ! ! ! ! !
good game for basic knowledge of everyday phrases . wish they would either make the hints cheaper or give more tokens .
this game is the best for any age . i 'm 18 and love it . it is so funny and i ca n't stop laughing when i play it .
this is one of the games you play to help pass time quickly . my wife has it on all the time .
this app could surely be & quot ; bingo heaven & quot ; ! ! ! thanks a bunch . : ~ ) i have been searching for a good bingo app but could not find anything i liked .
it takes too much time and energy to get stars . it 's seems like it really moves slow and does n't want you to finish . needs to be improve .
this app is ok , but i do n't think that its as good as a similar bird land . do n't get me wrong , its pretty cool but it gets boring after a while .
fun simple app that is addicting and just a simple concept . vivid colors and changing levels keep it fun
it seems like a more fun kid friendly temple run with some different twists . it is really addicting and good for killing time . just try it : its free anyway . it is so so fun and amazing
love this app . there are so many recipes on it and it takes up so little space on my kindle .
i do n't really use this at all . i got it to entertain my niece while she was here for the holidays . it was not all that i thought it would be .
this game was awesome i just wish i could have played more but i have to buy it the rest of to play it .
it not that good but it is okay to look up something fast that you wanted t look at on google .
love being able to check the weather in various places . prefer the old version as it is easier to use
super well made with a lot of extras to unlock so glad its now on my kindle fire a must have time waster
lots of fun ! meet lots of nice people ! entertaining for hours ! lets you explore your creative side ! makes getting up fun !
love this game helps them see that doctors are not bad for the ... . that the doctors just help them feel better
this is a good game and the help is very informative . i love these mystery games and always like the challenges that this game has . i would recommend the game to anyone who likes these mystery games .
i love bingo anyway . i especially love it when they come up with different and exciting ways to make it more interesting . this is fun
because of the teacher in this game i have learned a few new words ! ! this game is great for my kindle fire !
my daughter loves this app . all my kids have used this app to increase their vocabulary beyond other kids their age .
i hate this game cuz i think its to slow and the graphics sick eggs ! i like the original temple run but not this one . i suggest not to get it .
this seems like a cute game . i think my grandkids will like it . wish these games did n't rely so much on purchasing things with real money .
i love this app it keeps me posted on one of my favorite shows , recommend it to all , great app..
my little niece loves playing dress up and this app has some adorable clothes and items . although it would n't kill to add in a few more things .
i really did not like this app at all . there just was n't enough there for me . thanks for trying but it was n't good enough for me .
i love all mahjong games . it 's great to have them all on my kindle . i can use it in my down time or when i 'm on vacation .
once you start you just do n't want to stop playing . once you get stopped you ca n't wait to be able to play again . it 's a good game .
i love this game . with all the games available i come back to this one again and again . i love the bonus games and tournaments allowing you to play more .
enjoyable game . liked better than some games of this genre . however , not like other hidden objects which have a mystery type plot .
i have downloaded this application but as of yet have not used it for any other application or necessary system .
bike race is awesome it is worth the money and it 's very cool . you can connect on multiplayer and play with your friends .
it 's a wonderful game for young and old ! i have it on my kindle fire , with no issues at all ! if you like classic games get this one ! ! !
grandson loves to see how fast i can get the paper off of the roll , then is more than happy when he beats my time !
we are still learning how to play this application but my kids still like it and the are learning how to get the ball to hit the bubbles .
this app is okay but for inspiration would recommend everyone to read your bible ... ... this app is alright , i would recommend i guess .
i have had this app for a long time and it has been so helpful in my weight loss quest .
easy to play ; once you start playing , you wo n't be able to stop . very entertaining for a lot of ages .
easier than the previous battery monitor i had which seemed to cause problems . lots of user friendly features . try it
although i enjoy playing this game , it is n't quite as enjoyable as i thought it would be . it is n't quite what i expected when i ordered it .
this is a nice app , sometimes very accurate , i think overall i like it . would recommend just for the fun of it .
my kids have enjoy this game they like that it is easy to travel with since it 's digital . lots of fun .
this is a fun game . all of the , ads that pop up are a bummer , but other than that , it is a fun game .
this is a great program that works well on a computer as well as the kindle fire hd . it really is a nice aid to reading emails .
if you get this app you will quickly realize that after one time of playing it you will be willing to do . chores or go to work rather than play .
this game is really fun ! pretty easy , but some of them are a little challenging ! over all i like it ! so try it out
i suggest that you get this . it is fun and makes you think , but not so hard that it is impossible . i have truly enjoyed this game .
i first playing chef 2 and thought it was fun . i finish , that game and want to try this one . i think this one is okay it need some improvements and wish animation were little better .
i love it . it presents a challenge and i do n't want to put it down . it 's like the pac-man game i had years ago .
i opened it after downloading it for my eight year old daughter ... now i ca n't put it down ! maybe my daughter will get to play it !
erased it but it might have been another app cook book i meant to erase so try and see if this is the lame one .
i absolutely love this game ! in fact all of the big fish games that have the same theme are awesome ! i would recommend . this to anyone .

really enjoyed the game . the story kept my interest throughout the entire game . looking forward to the sequel . job well done .

i am not too sure about this game . my grand daughter down loaded it but did not like it and moved on to others right away .
really like this one . stopped playing angry birds to play cut the rope through . runs great on my galaxy s3 .
a great game for learning how words have more than one meaning . a good way to waste away a rainy day .
wont take too much time for this review , the game is not too good , still needs some heavy work , i cant say i like it and got bored pretty fast .
i played it on facebook at first . i got it set for my facebook friends . it 's good to play still and not be on facebook when you want to play with friends still .
i thought it was gon na be a fun game it 's a puzzle how stupid it does n't even say that it 's a puzzle it looks like you put makeup on people do n't get the app
match 3 games keep thinking and make me use my brain . i am retired so not a lot of things make me think a lot .
i love this game . lots of twist and interesting story line . puzzles and quests are just hard enough to be fun , not frustrating . ca n't wait for more .
i was prepared for this app to be a normal type of escape app . but it was much more challenging and in some places did not solve like i thought it would . very interesting and fun .
it has very basic options and i 'd like to see a little more , but it 's great to see a percentage when your phone does n't offer that on it 's own .
very fun and somewhat addictive . its a time killer and has somewhat ok graphics for a tablet . not willing to pay but today its free .
this is the most awesomeness app ever it is addicting and will keep you entertained for hours this games and minecraft are both games i would totally recommend for you

really keeps your mind and hands moving to play this game , never a dull moment with this buy it buy it
this is wonderful . can add your own graphics and wake up to the music you love . has a snooze and two different alarm times . also give you the weather . it 's the best .
a brain teaser that makes u really exercise your brain . a good brain training tool . sometimes it is n't what u might think at first so do n't give up
this is a quality game . the controls are solid . graphics could be better ... .but overall i think everybody should at least give the game a shot . kudos to the devs .
this is a fun game although eventually one runs out of the free episodes and has to pay for additional games .
got old after a while and once finished did not want to do it again . not quite what i had expected .
the bonuses for this game are fun and the log in bonus es are huge but you have to bet a lot to play the games .
the machines are paying good . a great way to pass time . the graphics are great . the bonus game and free spins are entertaining . like the messages sent while you are playing
my toddler really likes this game it doesnt have that many different puzzles though . they really need to update it and add more .
i love this game so much . i play it all the time . but once you get better at it , it gets harder .
fun game . some of the pictures are blurry making it hard to see the faces and there are way too many ads

it is really cool and great for horse lovers i love this game this game is fun to play and i love it
temple run 2 is the best one yet i made it to the mine place . love the game . on temple run 3 they should put a mode for multiplayer action . that would be awesome .
it plays the song good with the lyrics on the the screen . but ... ... it only plays the songs on the device . not any song
it is so boring all you do is click a candy and that 's all it is so boring you ca n't do anything do n't get it you will be bored of it in three seconds do n't get

this game has an interesting plot as well as variation of game play . i am usually not a big fan of hidden object games i am enjoying this one .
this is a great thinking and puzzle solving game . it reminds me of the 100 floors game but i like this game better . my only problem with it is that i wish there were more levels .

this game is fun and addictive some words are easy and some you really have to think about in each level

i like this app a lot . it entertains me as a lot of small things do . but after awhile i get kinda bored with it and run out of ideas to do .
this can be used as a fun way to brush up on math skills , for all ages . for those who do n't care for math , give this a try .
love the challenge . nice relaxing game to play while i am sitting in front of the tv . like the many different patterns offered .
no idea what this is as i only downloaded this to get a free mp3 song credit added to my amazon mp3 credit balance .

my son thinks this is a fun app , the animations make him laugh . i don ' t know that i like it enough to buy the full version though .
i have n't played this game very often , but when i do , i will let you know how i like it .
apparently whoever designed this game did not try it out on a kindle . the objects are way too small to see on that size screen .
i love this game . it works good on my kindle fire hd . it is really fun . this game is awesome and some games are really challenging and some are really easy .
this app does only a swipe back and forth . it looks neat but i was over it in 10 seconds . so was my 11 year old . dumb .
may entertain the kids but is really annoying to me . i can find better stuff to do with my time .
enjoyed this game very much ! i must be old or slow because it took me longer to finish than some of the other reviews said !
love this game . i like having a game that does n't require online access . it can be relaxing if you play classic or you can up your game by playing against the clock .
this is the best app for controlling the sound for every thing on the kindle every one that has one should get this app you will love it as much as i do
kept me thoroughly entertained . i liked that it provided clues or i would have lost interest after being stumped the first time . ca n't wait for additional rooms ! ! ! ! ! !

fun to play this game . i wish that i could get more free credits to play longer and level faster
this game is awesome ... i just started it and i like it . i recamend this game to many girls . i love i !
i hate this app because it wo n't let me sign in . it said it did n't recognize my password or email .
day i got it i played 11 races . pretty nice . now today is my 2nd day trying to play but it keeps crashing while loading . ended up deleting it .
i got this app for my husband 's phone . i tried it out and could n't put it down . so much fun ! you have to try it .
i have been playing this game for a long time and i can not get enough of this game . i wish we could get more gems instead of using real money .
one of the harder ones . lots of fun and good for kids . we can play together and it really gets harder as you go along .
i tried and i tried and i could n't figure out how to set an alarm . which by the way was the only thing i needed !
very easy puzzles . not very challenging . fun to do when you have a short time and ca n't be reading a book .
good game that is interesting but not too easy . one you win some lose some similar to real slots . good for those doctor office waits .
good game . easy to play and good for most ages . i would recommend this game to anyone who needs something to do in there spare time .
so far this app seems very intuitive . would be curious to see how the full version works if i ever get it . just have n't had much of a reason yet .
i like the hidden object games and this one is okay but the object are hard to see on a kindle . i still like it and will play it often .
i love your game it is so cool i think every body should play game i love this game i love it !
after my 7 year old enjoying a different puzzle game , i added this one to our apps . it 's good . i 'll recommend it to anyone who wants to keep their kid busy .
i got this as a free app from amazon and found myself playing it way too much . very addictive game .
great game i like it you should get it out is fun to play and enjoy the fun it is great for all ages fun fun fun fun fun fun challenging and great fun
it will not open please fix so i can actually play the game if u fix it i will update my review
this game is neat . very fun and challenging . if you like detective type games you 'll like this ... very entertaining ! like the graphics .
great calculator app ! love that you can edit it to make paying bills so much easier . would love a send to printer mode .
nice graphics . i enjoyed figuring out the order to use the objects and searching for hidden codes . my only complaint , to few levels . : )
only okay ... not my thing maybe . it is so well liked everywhere , i tried it and just could n't get into it .
great game love playing it . would play with friends but i 'm not on facebook . so i like to play by myself . it 's fun .
i really like these games a lot . i enjoy them because they are not fast paced . i play a lot of those on my xbox so its nice just to slow down .
it was fun , but it was a little difficult to see . it got a little boring after a few games it was a little slow moving ,
this is an addictive game . you keep trying to beat each level even if you have to start over . great for helping concentration
at first this is hard to play on the kindle fire but you get used to it . get this while it is at a low price or you will miss out !
every thing is cute and great and fun also awesome . great clothes shoes are awesome too just great this app rocks the house
this game is not what i expected . with this particular version you do not get any hints . you must pay for the hints , so if you get stuck you are out of luck
i love mega jump but it took a little while for it to load . otherwise the loading it was awesome and really fun to entertain kids
it did not have stuff telling you how to start to play th e game . if you never played it you a 're lost at a horse race .
it cost too much to play more than one card every time i signed on . i did n't like this game !
my son loves this app ! perfect . for car rides and waiting rooms . he loves that he gets to touch and hear all the sounds !
this is not to bad a game . it is better than i thought it would be . it is also easier than i thought too .
very good game . probably even better than cut the rope . very challenging and smart . so cute and nice a a a a a
it 's , a great app with nice graphics and beautiful color . i enjoy the games . it has good pay outs also . i recommend this app for sure !
i let my grandson pick this out and he loves it.i 'm a word game person or logic puzzle person .
downloaded the free version and upgraded to the full version a day later . fun time management game like diner dash , etc .
its the same game i got it for my little girl and when it was done loading it was the same game
find myself playing this game a lot ! it gives you three themes to choose from , the graphics are crisp . very fun !
game is frustrating , the clues are lacking and now i 'm stuck . please fix this issue for samsung galaxy s ii .
this app is good to have when you need to look up the weather . the graphics are very good and clear .
i love this game it is fun and all that until u cant do anything then u have to start over boo
my granddaughter likes this app . she thinks the sounds are funny . she put it on my kindle so i could hear it and laugh with her .
it is fun and entertaining for all adults and something one should think about when checking games out entertaining entertaining
i love the idea and everything but their are times when i have to catch the song all over again but other than that i love this app .
i 'm probably one of the only people who do n't enjoy temple run , but i ca n't stand this game . i can see why it 's popular , but not my cup of tea .
it is easy , yet challenging enough to be addictive and fun ! a free app , that is worth actually paying for !
too difficult to play on my kindle which is what i used to download this app . maybe better in some other medium .
i was happy with the way facebook worked on my kindle . i felt i received as much info as if i logged in on my pc
i got this app for free on the amazon market and it is very addictive . it is hard to beat your own high score after a while , but it is still fun .
i have played many similar games . with this game i really like the different levels , and getting the egg to bottom to clear the level .
easy to play . fun for the whole family . get to play with friends online . or random with people . can play at your own pace .
omg one of the best realistic game ever . just like having your own fish : - ) love it . if you love this game like me also try bird land amazing too : - )
neat way to have fun with colors . easy to play and can be relaxing at the same time . great time passer with nice music to boot . very simple challenge .
this is my new favorite game . it gas cute graphics , interesting elements and it challenges your thinking . i would give it 6 stars if i could .
this app does what it says , however someone like me would find a normal everyday calculator more useful . filler . filler . filler .
this is a great free game .. my whole family is addicted to playing ! we ca n't wait until we can choose to play against each other instead of only playing random people
this app is great . i 'm having so much fun with it . i 'd like to see more like it . great job .
this game is sooooooo addicting i cant stop playing it even though you have to upgrade to get better its good im writing random things i like trains
fun game with plenty to do to keep you busy and go back and check on later . havent had to spend real money which is important .
love this game . it makes you think so you learn to think ahead . my granddaughter loves it and i feel she is learning something while she is playing it .
addictive game play makes this app a time consumer . it has the arcade carnival feel you would expect . slightly more info about the puzzle screen would have been nice .
very impressive app ! definitely worth the download ! lots of weather information in a very attractive format . this app has improved quite a bit over the years !
easy n fun t play . very intuitive and easy to operate . easy mode takes a 10 minutes t complete . good brain game .
i like this game . passes time and makes you think . only thing is hints costs way too much . besides that its worth having
i like this game a lot . the basic bubbles rotate as you match them and so it becomes more of a challenge . i had no problem connecting to facebook .
for those who beginning with meditation this is a great app for you ! ! helps you to get started and what to do .
enjoyed the story line and puzzles . most of all had no glitches on my kindle fire which says a lot for some of the apps that have come out recently ... enjoy ... .
i got this app by mistake . i did n't really want it . how can i get it off my kindle ? thanks !
it is great for when i am not near my phone . i love movies and it is an easy way to keep on top of the movies i want to see .
it is a cool app , and fun to play with , mostly for the grandkids but interesting if you like the stars and want to identify them .
kids loved it , especially the younger ones . would like to see more like this , without ads of course . thank you
i love to play hidden object games , the holiday graphics are very nice . i recommend this game to anyone who loves playing mahjong .
it crashes and there no buttons and is glitchy and i do n't like it waste of my money and you have to click around just to play just for it to crash again
great game . good for families . fun and educational at the same time . i recommend this game to anyone who l who loves word games
love this game . i play when i get up and before i go to sleep . hard to win put that 's what makes you keep on playing try it i know you will like it .
i 've been playing this game on my iphone for a long time , i was so happy to get it on my kindle ! it 's challenging and fun , very addictive ... love it ! !
its alright , i was to impatient to enjoy it . perhaps you will . perhaps you will become as awesome as awesomeness does .
this one is very , very good also . i like how you move all over . good thought process on this one .
its a good game but if you do not know how to play you will find yourself frustrated fast . if you are willing to learn you will have hours of enjoyed play time .
good game to keep you thinking my granddaughter who is 8 years also had fun trying to solve the puzzles . it is a game where you keep going and going . lots of fun .
this is a great game as well . this game makes you think fast . this game is the greatest game to have while waiting on an appointment or just need to pass time .
i really like this app . it is very easy to use . i use it more than i thought i would ! ! so yea go get this app ! ! ! ! : d
this free app is fun and works just like a las vegas slot would , minus the free drinks and the loss of your money .
this game is very addicting and very challenging . it has some easy ones along the way , but the hard ones really rack your brain .
i enjoy bubble games . i did n't give it five stars because i like bubble worlds better . it works well on the kindle and is fun to play .
i enjoyed this game so much i could n't put it down . i put it on my nieces kindles too . love it !
this was certainly a different story line then most adventure games . very well done and worth the money . had no issues playing it on kindle hdx . would definitely purchase another game made by them .
it is one of the good games for kids to play . i have enjoyed playing this game for hours and i do n't have to wait long in doctor 's office lol !

this game is fun and makes you think in order to come up with the right solution . i really like it .
this game would n't work on my sons android tablet i tried a couple different things but could n't get it to work so i uninstalled it
i think i needed to be familiar with these types of games to enjoy it without having to find directions online and follow them .
i love this app . it has fun levels and their challenging . super fun and it will test your knowledge and skill . i do recommend you get it : )
kids ages 2 & 4 love this . they dance to the songs a nd watch the videos . love to find the objects .
kids enjoy this game . glad to have free games like these for the little ones . thanks again to those putting the free ones out there
movement is to slow , had trouble playing the game . did n't much like the faces of the other players on the side of the screen . not my type of cheap play .
love it , could use more hints though , it takes a few moments of intense concentration to find some of the items , like getting items needed to advance in other levels ! ! great game .
do n't have access to listening to this a lot but when i do it is fun . always something funny going on
my girls love this game . they just use all their energy and have to wait to play again the next day .
good sudoku app for kindle fire ... it helps pass time for the sudoku lover . i love the extreme ones
scared , scared , scared , i wo n't be able to sleep at night like the time i tried high school of the dead . & gt ; & lt ; i hate zombies .
it 's a cute game but i dont like how some quest require that you have to buy clothing in order to complete them .
i tried using this app to print but could n't get it to work . it 's not very user-friendly and i would n't use it again .
very fun game . good combination of both types of cartoon wars . great upgrades and fun gameplay . need to work to get better stuff . great !
game worked great and was fun also on my kindle fire . this lite version was short but enough to get me interested in the full version for the future .
i really like this game . it 's very easy to use and i 've played it several times since i downloaded it !
i really liked this game . the story awesome and it picture was great . the puzzles was n't to hard . i ca n't wait for the second one ! ! !
christmas pics : good pictures . i like being able to scroll through the slide show . great variety of different subject matter .

this is a terrific game on any pad . hrs of fun . my grandkids love it . great entertainment when waiting in long lines
deleted bingo world 2 minutes after downloading . not fun . save yourself time , find another game to kill your time . have a nice day
a perfect game to kill a few hours ! it is playable by both the young and old and will be enjoyed by both .
its fun for the most part but what most people do n't usually put is u can go to options and learn to play one of the songs listed . so i think it is fun
i love this app there are lots of different songs to choice and listen to i love it and hope you all will like it too !
i think this app might just be my favorite . i love guessing and the more u get the more levels u have . its super fun i really like this app .
this is a great game . just download and play the free game then decide if you like it . it is that simple . you have to make up your own mind . you can always hit delete .

love this game , works great on my kindle fire hd with no issues . fun and always has stuff to do including a mini game that is way fun !
i have always wanted a horse and this game is so so so so so so so so so so cute ! ! !
do you like angry birds and star wars ? then this is the game for you ! ! it is full of wonderful star war themes ! !
huge numbers make it easy to use . i love that it is truly free ! no glitches as of yet & i use it at work all the time !
i did n't care for the game . it did n't make sense to me . enjoyed the scenes . maybe it is for a younger group .
this is the best golf app i 've played . i got it free but worth s buck any day . so get it now .
it 's an okay game , good thing it was free for i would have never paid money to buy it . i will however keep it on for my granddaughters .
my son loves playing chess and checkers on the board games so now he loves playing them on his kindle as well .
this game is awesome and i love playing it on my ipod but since i play my kindle more i was very happy to find out this game is on amazon . awesome game and good graphics
did n't play it at all . if the slots are not like or similar to real casino slots , i do n't play them .
i have used pandora on my phone and i love it . the talk shows are awesome . yes , definitely recommend this to everyone of any age .
i choose a 5 star rating because pandora is a great ap to have to listen to music and no complaints about how it works . would recommend to all .
i got very bored very fast . reminds me of simple little games from my childhood 15 years ago . cool app .
i really love playing slots ! and not spending my own money is even better ! ! ! try it ! you will like it ! really !
just started , but it seems fun so far . so i gave it four stars for now . i may update this at a later date .
this is a great app have all of the team lava games and do n't listen to the bad reviews saying : its not free i got purchases only stupid people that do n't have a brain would say that
i know this sounds weird but this app is very accurate for me i do n't know what it is but the mood scanner always seems to know how i feel
really fun game . it is cool . you can run and hop from train to train . it 's kinda like temple run ! !
the artwork is n't very good . no fun . not worth the effort . took it off my device . way to simple for adults ... might be okay for elementary ages .
wonderful game . entertaining with great graphics ! the best part of this game is that it 's not overly challenging which makes it so difficult to play .
some of these are pretty challenging . a fun game for when you have a few minutes and want a quick game to pass the time .
this is a fun and quick paced game that really gets your mind working . this game will keep you on your toes .
could use a way to share with others , the good word is not meant to keep to your self : - )
this is one of the funnest and funniest games i 've ever played , i absolutely love it and recommended it for everyone ... .
it is not a bad app . for people who are really into watching new and old tv shows . i like it !
i have watched a few shows and have not had any problems so far . it 's nice to have this app when you have several shows on you want to watch at the same time . thanks abc
i spent hours and hours playing this game . very addictive and easy to play . great game to pass the time .
nice hidden object game for free . good graphics g5 does a nice job ! tried other hidden object games by other outfits but g5 makes the best
love diner dash and all of flo 's adventures . i find them fun and entertaining just wish the free game came with a few more levels .
i love the graphics and the christmas theme is wonderful , my only complaint would be is that there are so many levels to reach to unlock the next game .
have always played hearts and with this game am learning spades before getting together with friends it 's lots of fun .
i have n't tried any of these recipes yet , but i hardly ever do try anything new . i just like having these recipes in case i ever want to .
i really like all the sims games and was happy when i found out they allowed one for the kindle . it downloaded pretty quick and did n't take long to set up .
my grandson used my tablet and played the a lot over his christmas break . would definately recommend for the little guys that love the action
this is a very entertaining game and very relaxing . you get to use you reflexes . i am a garfield fan and really love this game .
i love this game ! ! ! it 's so cool . i never run out of energy that 's the best part ! ! ! my 3 yr old grandson loves the fishing game !
this app is really fun i am only rating this because that 's the only way i can open the other board
i just ca n't wait to get home to play this game . i 've never been one to play games but i do like this .
ive always wanted to play the sims and now they 've finally come up with this great quality fun and free app ! i love it .
i like the look and functionality of this app . i 'm yet to use it in the field , but am sure i 'm going to use it a lot !
fun and entertaining for all ages . it does have in app purchases but you do n't need them to enjoy playing and building a city . con is that they are no longer updating this app .
i should have never got this app because i just love it . you get to shop and window shop . love it !
this is a very nice light , select colors and allows to use some very nice features of the device i did n't know where there
i 've had this app for more than a year now and i think it is great ! i find 1 or 2 free new books on it every day .
it 's very easy and fun . i have many games like it but this one is the best . i reccomend it to anyone .
i 've tried these games before but could n't ' understand them . the instructions did the trick . great game to relax with . good job guys .
i really enjoy playing this game . i find it more interesting than the games that begin with all four pictures showing . i definitely recommend it .
easy to use and i just highlight the word with my finger to color it . if you like this type of word search , this is great .
it is ok but i dont play it very much dont have the time to play every game all the time but it seems nice when i play . i have the ads
it 's free so give it a try . so far i 've played the puzzle game . it 's free , you get what you pay for ... or do n't pay for : - )
has three options to choose from and the scratch play is simple . odds of winning something are fairly high . wish you could buy additional tickets with your winnings . otherwise , game play is repetitive .
i like a lot of things about but what i did not like was that it is hard to navigate threw that app .
really the best movie quiz i have ever played . i recommend it to everyone . also it looks easy but it 's not so easy you get bored of it .
this game is entertaining and amusing . it lasts a long time . also , you do n't need to pay extra money to go on .
i am really enjoying this game ! this is the second g5 game that i 've tried and if you like adventure games , i totally recommend it !
this is a challenge game and a mind game . this is so much fun to play , helps your mind work and concentrate .
this is a really good game ! i love the challenge and difficulties that it brings ! if you 're on the edge of downloading this game please do .
i might learn to like it if i can find out what to do with it . i need more information
i honestly love this game a lot , but now whenever i log on to the game , it takes about 10 minutes to load , and the game is always updating !
boring to say the least . plus even though it free app , it wants you to purchase coins to play . nope ... not for me .
i love this game it is the game i play all day long i also play minecraft you should get that game it is really fun it just got the update .
easy and fun to play , hard to see more that 2 cards at a time , like having objectives to work on as you play game
i 'm enjoying this game it is not real difficult but that 's all right its quite entertaining . i would recommend it to a friend .
my nieces love this , they older one is getting a bit too old for it but the younger one just ca n't get enough !
this game if fun and challenging . it is much harder than a previous version that i have and i like the challenge .
i love this app i mean it has great graphics and it is fun so you should definitely get it
i like this game and will play the second one soon . i will probably get more of their other games .
loaded fine but i could n't get it to work at all + it seemed to mess up my screen resolution until i un installed it .
my kids love this game on the kindle fire . keeps their attention and engaging . have not had any issues or problems with the game loading or freezing up . really worth it for kids ! !
this game is fun and entertaining for both the kids and myself . if you like minion 's you will enjoy this game .
my 4 year old son and 6 year old daughter love playing this . they find it entertaining and as a mom it is not violent in any way so i do not mind them playing it .
puzzles are not too difficult , and just challenging enough to keep you coming back for more ! very entertaining . clear pictures and easy to learn how to play .
this game is good for beginners and pro 's . many starting games.i got it for me . and my 6 year old granddaughter plays great .
it 's a great fun game that you can play when you 're bored and its a good time consumer . but some of the logos are pretty hard .
this game offers variety and opportunities to win . it 's simply relaxing and enjoyable ! provides a positive experience . i recommend it !
i love the game , graphics and general design . the breeding is a bit frustrating ... might just be me , lol . great job , guys .
i love it and to be honest i 'm only on the third level just got it and i like it already so addicting .
i played the game for hours , took a break and was right back playing , thanks for this one , i really enjoy it .
the water seems to run out quickly . maybe a few more seconds would help on the more difficult levels while playing .
this is a great game . i have a couple of friends who now enjoy this game to .
this is the best thing for online information always send you to the right thing who every made this thank you so much for making this online search
my two and a half year old son loves it ! he hardly ever sits still , but with shape builder , he 'll sit for at least 30 min .
this is a fun game . a little challanging as well . it keeps me entertained . i would recommend it to everyone .
i purchased the candy crush saga game for my enjoyment . it is so much fun . it is a great game and i highly recommend it .
cute game , keeps my kids entertained for a little while . it is a good one for practicing colors and following directions .
the app is pretty good . i wish it could open from the browser or that links would open in the app , but overall its a good app . worth . the $ 2 for sure .
sorry not a fan , too simple and not challenging . played for a few minutes then deleted .
the free app game is entertaining but it has a limited amount of levels to play with hints that are available .
good graphics . lots of variations . becomes more challenging as you progress . very addictive . am having a great time with it . good purchase .
this game is fun and i really like the touch control i would recommend playing . feels like the real thing .
i 'm hooked on this game . it 's really easy though . i miss not having candy crush saga on my kindle hd , so this is the next closest thing .
i love playing bingo , but this is a great bingo . love free coins . i play everyday . i give this game five stars .
i just want them to fix the time to load game . it is a fun game.i love strategy games so much . this is another great game !
awesome ! i have tried a lot of tap the black tile games but this is the best one so far
kept getting messages about loss of memory so i had to get rid of the game the next day -- i 've tried other games before and never had that problem about memory .
very good app and the best 2 dollars you can buy . works great on the kf hd . seriously handy application .
not what i hoped it would be not enough news on it at any one time i will have my husband change it .
this game is really bad ! warning : do not get ! minecraft is way better than this trash . this game is poop .
it 's worth the money . i know it 's $ 1.99 , but i think anyone would love it ! great for any age !
i bet this game works cuz i had a candy apple game like this so it 's probably gon na work so good luck to me !
it is just pictures you can find in a design magazine . the 5 star reviews are clearly fake . i am uninstalling as soon as i finish this review .
easy pass the time game that we all need to have ! anyone can play it and it is a fun game .
really like the recipe section and the grocery section , but ca n't get things to work . ca n't sign in to web . ca n't get full recipes . could n't upgrade .
you can play different modes from relaxing to more challenging . i really enjoyed this game . it 's also very relaxing . well worth the spare change it costs .
this is an addictive game and fun for whoever plays this game . i know whoever plays will have fun playing it .
it kept jumping all over and did not run right .i did not like it at all i found it not fun at all .
its ok but it is really expensive . and it is not worth it . i would n't recommend unless you got it as the free app of the day like i did .
this game is fun and addicting ! even my 5 year old grandson loves it . it takes some skill , but is not too difficult . awesome !
fun game , very challenging . it keeps me busy . passes the time when waiting for appointments , etc . different levels keep it from being boring .
this is a lot of fun to use while training your brain to hold memory . i recommend this product for all who needs memory !
i did not like this game at all . all you do is feed your baby . i do not recommend this game .
this game is great because it is a good game to past time with . if you 're bored you can play bingo and win coins and stuff .
this game is so awesome i ca n't stop playing it is also adicting but still very fun and i 'm glad that the people made this it is so awesome
i know that my husband has enjoyed playing this game alot . he never plays games but i noticed that this one game that he plays so it must be alot of fun . glad he enjoys it
omg ! i have been playing this app for a couple of years now on my different devices and i love it ! definitely get this app if u do n't already have it !
this game was surprisingly really fun ! if you like challenging games and like to think this game ia for you !
worth the download on the kindle fire . this game is fun and very addicting . if i did not download the cheat version along with the game i would still be on the first floor .
did not know what kind of game this was when purchased . my great granddaughter likes this kind of game to play
if you like to enhance your thought process . then this game is for you . you can play with friends or meet other people .
i enjoy this game very much . i play it every day . i have not had any problems at all . i would recommend this to everyone .
ads are n't too bad . that quick finger note is not very accurate but works well . nice quick finger note . short learning curve - but you need to test .
very good game to pass the time away . only has 3 hands but that is because its free . you get the hang of it .
i would recommend it to friends i really like this game . it 's a little fast paced . but i enjoy it . very fun and entertaining .
my daughter and i have fun playing this game together , great way for us to work together . we 've only been stumped twice .
this is a pretty cool app . do n't take it too seriously , it takes some practice . it will probably be awhile before i use it for anything but fun .
sync my pictures on my computer phone and kindle ! yay it even works on my kindle offline . great app thanks !
nice photos , stock but clear . lots of helps without spending too much coin . fun little game . kids would enjoy too .
lots of puzzles in this one and i like being able to shuffle the tiles when i want to instead of waiting until i 'm in a jam . this one is a keeper !
it is cute and limited in selection , but if more people would use it , i 'm sure it would take off .
fun engaging game ! i did n't realize how many restaurants there were and those i actually know . worth the download and it 's free .
not crazy about this app i deleted it . the graphics were n't good and you can only play it for a while i really would not recommend this to anyone who likes these types of games .
i like this game . it can be a challenge but it is fairly basic and keeps my brain working . it is a time filler .
it 's okay , but not as enjoyable as many of the other hidden objects games i have played . may think differently after i play it a little more often .
this freezes all the time it use to be great but now it sucks bad i reccomend not downloading this app
this is great for me and my nine year old . we take the time to play together . when we have a challenge we take a break and go back to pic .
this game gives your brain a work out and it really make you think . some are really easy but other take a while to figure out . lots of fun .

this app is a good choice for my needs in word search . i like the word selections and variety of the game
i should have just kept what i had and not upgraded . it would n't even load my emails after a half hour of waiting ! so frustrated ! !
its a very fun game and a great way to waste time . not all that difficult but still fun to mess with .
not sure how it works because i did n't get a chance to use this yet . i 'm sure it will work fine .
it 's good for what it is . great way to kill some time and you do n't need to be online to play which is great when you have a device that needs a wifi connection .
this game is really fun . i. enjoy it . i would recommend this game to everyone and i suggest you to get it .
nice to have to think and use reason . tired of games that do n't challenge me . ca n't put it down . great game .

this app is so awesome . i am a master at this game . i love this game so much . this game is the most awesome game in the whole universe
love it ... this is a fun game that will make your mind work : ) i like playing it with my daughter : )
i 'm giving it four stars before playing just because of the app description . yes , i 've played games just like this in the past , but the developer made it sound fresh and exciting : - )
game for like a 2 yr old . this was super boring and idk why i even downloaded it to try it
my grandchildren love it . the & # 34 ; frozen characters & # 34 ; are fun to interact with and the games are challenging enough to keep the kids occupied for hours .
i enjoy all of the angry bird games , they help me wind down after work and dinner , and at my age this is good .
i love it . i really does work . i sleep much better after using the tablet before bed . i am so glad i found it .
this is the best sports app on android . works great and has a widget that you can customize . highly recommend for scores and stats . also has closing betting odds . great app .
have not used this as much as i would like to but i really like this app . i have recommended it to all my friends and family .
this game is not for me or for children it 's to bloody . i like happy things & games that make sense . you do n't have kill something to have fun .
having a lot of fun playing these games . i can 't wait to unlock more . posting this review to get more points like everybody else .

i so enjoy watching history documents i am very ill and it helps me get interesting things to learn not stupid television and so many adds .
i thought i would like this app , but it was not what i thought it was . i have removed this app from my device .
it 's like temple run but with a twist and it makes u want to try again and again it 's cool
fun to play . ads are n't a big deal and no real pressure to buy extras just so you can complete a level .
i enjoy the fact you can play of line and on graphics are great ... . no issues with crashing on my kindle hours of fun
this game is lots of fun . love building my own village . and it 's free . what else can u ask for .
i like the game but i think you should give more credits to play the game when you sign on to play .
lots of fun to play . coming up with correct words with the given letters is n't always easy . makes me think !
it is okay , need to add different games to it , the ones on there are okay but not great . still had fun but you are limited one day play , recommend it slightly
the game was too easy to complete which made it boring after a while . but besides that ir was a fun game
this the most fun game i ever played on a tablet ! most apps are make for a touch screen but not this one , it feels like a game for a console ! awesomeness
my 3 yr old daughter is a master of this game , and my 5 yr old likes the harder grid .
enjoyed playing against machine rather than on web i can stop playing at any time that i need to stop
i do n't like the fact that you have to buy new things to go on with the game . so no
love the game.the mini games are really fun to play and u seem to get slot of them . if u love slots give this on a try . u will not regret it
i love love love love this game i play it with my mom and she always beats me with the older songs .

is a fun game . was going good until my kindle lost all data . now starting over . would not waste the time with other games .
never freezes . adds only pop up with each new deal . plenty of ways to change the settings to match your preferred style of play .
i love this site . i am on it all the time getting recipes and ideas . great for the holiday ideas .
i just could not put in down ! ! ! ! i thought maybe i would just play for a few minutes , the minutes turned to a couple hours .
this book is very informative but i have seen much better . i would still recommend to a friend friend to keep on pc .
i thank it a great arcade game i love arcade games a lot of games to choose from and you will never get tired of one particular game because their are a variety of games to choose from .

i love playing . i have gotten to play with family that lives far away or old friends i have n't seen i 'm forever !
worst app out there you ca n't even go to the other levels unless you spend money so do n't waste your time they say it 's free but then make you pay if you want to continue
fun game , but as soon as i 'm about to win the level the screen goes black . playing on the kindle fire .
this game is a lot of fun and a fun time to allow time to go by . i will sit down and play it and the next thing i know hours have passed
so it kinds fun but not what i was thinking my friends said oh its adicting you 'll love it well i do n't
did n't care for it . takes too long to download . might have been a cool game if we could have played it .
my daughters got me interested in this game and even though my fashion sense is not that great , i 've decided i love this game !
i play lots but it have short puzzle time . it should be more puzzles but limit . please make more puzzles because i love them lots .
this is an ok puzzle game . nothing too exciting , not much of a variety . kills time ... i would think there are better ones out there .
i have player plenty of games . the bonuses are smaller than other games but the wins are more and it is funner than other games .
this game was really enjoyable . i loved figuring out how to save the green boxes . however , there were only a few levels in the version i got .
i love this app because of the wide variety of comics and the ability to take my comics on the go .
not as good as the old & # 34 ; game boy & # 34 ; version of many years ago .
i love this game ! highly recommended ! ! ! many hours of mindless fun when i needed it . buy it ! ! you wo n't regret it .
fun . free . i am a bongo junkie so i enjoy playing on the go with my kindle fire and i also play at home on my computer .
would love to use it but do not want to join yahoo to use it . was not aware i would have to do that .
awesome game very addicting and fun . the mini games are great and entertaining . almost like diner dash but with zombies lol
mostly good . really not bad . just kinda okay . works to kill time . decent distraction . like it enough to keep it on my phone . basically not junk .
it works just like it is supposed to . it is easy to use and gives me the information i need .
both grandsons ages 5 and 13 love this game especially the 13 year old . once he starts playing he laughs i have to make him put it down .
love this app . only problem is i wish my child could adjust volume and screen brightness on her own . it is a pain to have to adjust the volume myself multiple times during a game .
this is alright . it 's kinda boring . i have n't played it in a while , but it 's ok. it was free so that the good thing !
game is very fun and it gets harder as you get further with each shark . you upgrade to different sharks the longer you play . recommend for anyone wanting to play a simple fun game .
we all enjoy this game . 2 year old great grandson loves it , grand kids love it and i enjoy playing . it 's a game for everyone .
awesome game i love it so much although i 'm just ten it is a fun game new for kids my age .
does make u think . not addicting but makes you really think of combinations of words . the only th ok by is it does n't let you skip . the hints are worth coins .
great game held my interest all the way through the game . lots of fun looking for all the hidden objects . there are a lot you really need to look all over the different scenes .
i love that you can challenge other people . this is just like scrabble , only this one you can play world wide !

it runs perfectly on the kindle fire . i have always been a tetris fan . i find this to be a fun game . runs smoothly .
i prefer a game like the lost city compared to this . this is an ok game but i wouldnt have bought it if i knew what it was about . it didnt really challange me .

i bought it today that its free i love it i would of payed for it . its just like the board game . it works great on my kindle fire .
i am loving this game . i play a lot of the hidden object games . this one has been a lot of fun . i recommend this game completely .
this is a very entertaining app . it is easy to use , and offers a great deal of information . i recommend this app to others .
when coloring the pictures you tap a part of the picture then the whole pic turns that color . not many colors to choose from . and should have some better pictures to color .
installed this thinking it 'd be lots of fun . instead , i do n't think it lasted 3 days before i uninstalled it . just plain boring .
these are short little games , but at least there is a lot of variety . i like having to play them in order to unlock more .
i really like this game . it took me a while to get used to how to play but now i enjoy it very much .
i love this app . could be improved by being able to choose background colors and drawing types and colors . otherwise it would be a 5 star app
a nice little app if you do n't have texting on your phone ... or you wish to use another device .
i played it on my computer and of course , the cards were larger and easier to see on the computer .
the fun factor goes away in an hour .you can set the gun to fire for an alarm or notification 's that 's probably the best thing about the application .
i enjoy this quick read and thought for the day . a good pick me up for the upcoming day and something i miss if i do n't read it everyday .
all the apps stay open and burn battery life on my tablet until i power off , with this app i close them when i 'm done with them . great app for free .
i live the games that i can play on the go . this is one that at home i play online and on the go on my kindle fire hd .
this is so much fun . great game to unwind from a stressful day . i would recommend to all ages to play this game .
i 'm pleased so far with this game ( level 4 ) . it combines town building , strategy and turn based battle . i have n't had to spend any money yet !
i use it for everything ! i am a teacher and i use it for grades . it 's great and i use it all the time .
i dont know why people r giving this game bad reviews ... i love it ... . great picture and amazing on kindle and i pad ! 5 stars !
its fun and mostly a challenge . some times share it with family so be get a bit competitive . but its fun to do especially when you are just sitting for a long period of time .
great app . i have this installed on my kindle device . i have n't used it much yet , but seems to be a very handy app to have .
this game is awesome . nothing like good clean fun for my grand-daughter . this game would keep her entertained for hours , if i let her play that long . thank you , for such an entertaining game
it is a very fun game to play . i play it all the time . i really love love this game .
i downloaded this game today . i did n't have any problems with ads . i also have n't had any issues running on the fire so far .
it 's classic zuma , there is n't much else to say . there are ads , but what do you expect when it 's free ?
my son liked this at first but then he lost interest . i ended up deleting it and finding him something else .
it 's something to do to fill the time . nothing special about it . it 's easier to win than spider solitaire , which makes it more boring .
perfect game for on the go parents with kids who love puzzles as much as mine . even i get into the puzzles
love this game ! i am getting higher in the levels and i get more coins that way . love that ! it is a great time passer .
this app works great on my kindle , do n't see any difference between this and yahoo ? mail on my laptop . it is easy to access folders to store message in .
this app was so much fun . it takes a lot of strategy to solve the puzzles quickly and collect all the ducks . i just finished the whole game and am waiting 4 the next installment .
i like the app on my phone , but the kindle fire version seems to freeze up a lot . i quit using this and started using reddit is fun .
this game is fun and the backgrounds are so very beautiful and relaxing . it works well on my kindle fire .
i love this game ! i could play this game all day long and not get tired of it . i would recommend this game to anyone who likes playing games that involve dice !
i find this so easy to use . it 's a favorite to catch up watching tv shows on the kindle . ads are short and to the point .
love having the ability to get free books for my kf . it makes traveling so much more enjoyable . i highly recommend trying it .
warning -- once you start playing this game , you are hooked . it is a great game , i can totally lose track of time playing it !
i even got an e-mail about the update but cant update on my kindle fire ! i would play this game alot more if i could get the update ! where is the kindle fire update people ! ! !
this was a fun game . i played it on a kindle fire and it worked great . the story line was kind of silly but that was part of the charm .
overall good app . great way to kill the time . would be perfect if you could pass and play and play other opponents over the network .
this game will really test your memory skills . some of the items have n't been seen for some time but you won ` t have too much trouble remembering them . , it is fun .
so far i am loving this game . i can choose which way my character goes , be good or bad . also fun for teens .
too many ads & amp ; runs poorly on my android phone . dont bother downloading this poorly made app . not worth it , even when free
the puzzles are very beautiful . fun to do . it would be helpful if the board did not move as you were trying to do the puzzle would reccomend this puzzle to others
this game is like the other ones you just need to think what all pictures have in common some are kind of tricky .
my son loves this game . does n't matter if he plays by himself or if i help him , he loves it .
this app is so much fun . there are few things that the original uno does not have . i highly recommend getting this app . you should get this app .
my granddaughter loves this along with the tons of other kindle aps she has .
i do n't know what i expected but this was not it . i found the voice to aggravating and not soothing . i just was not impressed .
it makes it easier to get on the amazon site through my tablet . seems to work ok , but have n't used it much as of yet .
i love this app . very useful and convenient , fun and does the job without a lot of fuss . good deal for the price .
its ok i dont always like it alot so you should get it for younger kids to play with it
i clicked on this by mistake and did n't want the game on my kindle . no more words to describe it
this is a great riddle game for those who love a challenge . it 's good exercise for your brain . what are you waiting for , get the app and start thinking ! ! !
love all the angry birds games . they certainly are challenging but oh so much fun . great games ! would recommend these games for anyone .
the game is awesome i just with we could have friends and add people to our friend list so later on if they are online we can invite them to a game
a friend was playing this and go me hooked ! sometimes the word does n't seem right for all the pics , but that just makes your brain work harder .
i enjoyed it when l played for awhile , but it kept giving me the same things to find . i would recommend this for children and it would be something to keep them occupied .
i can watch youtube on my kindle fire with . this browser . so cool ! ! so glad i found this one . i highly recommend it
i actually did n't use this after all as i was not prepared to enter all my recipes . might be good for someone who wants to go to that sort of trouble .
it 's cute to play with but lose interest would n't really recommend it to anyone kind of boring not that fun
so far so good . it appears that this is going to another interesting game . i must say so far the games that i 've chosen from this particular creator or creators have been enjoyable and fascinating .
i like this because you do n't keep playing the same game over and over . ever time i play they are different . sometimes i get them all and sometimes i do n't . i like a challenge .
essential to have on my kindle fire ; practical and handy . glad i have it on my kindle fire - it helps to have it .
i enjoy playing this game and enjoy playing with people that do n't have word cheat apps to help them out .
i enjoyed playing this game . it is addicting and when others watch you they want to play this game also . it is a must have game .
i love this game if i could make one change it would but more stuff to make at less time i thing some of the times are to long
candy crush is amazing . it is one of my favorite games ! i would highly recommend this to people who like problem solving games !
the game was nothing that i expected to be . you really do not crush the words but have to find them like find a word puzzles .
this game was great ! been a little while since i enjoyed a big fish game this much ! from the sound of the reviews people are really enjoying it ! keep games like this coming big fish !
i love this game , it is a lot of fun to play . awesome game . my family enjoys playing the game to .
it is ok i think it could take less time to install all it does is quiz you like i expected it to .
i have this game on my computer and like it but did not get the opportunity to buy it on my kindle .
i love this game so much i have it on my kindle and my phone ! thank you for creating this game ... i 'm addicted !
i got mahjong on my kindle because i seem to be waiting a lot in different places . i love to read but their are places a quick game fits the bill better .
i use all the time to keep updated . i use the weather more than weather channel . would download to my phone too
this is a really fun game . not as easy as it looks as you get farther into it . i like the different twist on it . i play it many times a day .
this game is so much fun ! i love being able to play with her whenever i want . it 's so relaxing : d i will highly recommend !
fun to play and makes me think ! i like that there are levels and they get harder . glad an app such as this one was created . passes the time for sure !
i just started playing this game and have found it interesting and fun . nice way to spend some free time
this is an interesting puzzle game . i enjoy the challenge . not much more to say about it , bit i do not have enough words to submit .
fun and mildly entertaining , simple to start with and then progressively more challenging . good for those interested in crossword puzzles , scrabble , and similar word games .
i upgraded to hd so i did n't have to put up with the ads since i absolutely love this game !
i enjoy playing this game . it makes you think about the answer and can be challenging at times . good way to kill time .
i was not interested in this type of art . it was hard to manipulate . just not for me . not bad concept .
this app did n't quite live up to how it was described . it is definitely for someone who wants to keep an electronic diary .
one reason i love this app is because it is a brain teaser for everyone and even little tiny kids .
it was fun for awhile . but then it just became repetitive . but it was good for awhile and i 'd load it it again .
the graphics are pretty real . i like that you are in control of what happens , makes the game more strategic . i recommend the game it 's fun and addicting .
i downloaded this app for my daughter and she ca n't stop talking about it . great app and i hope she gets something out of it .
fast paced and easy to do . can put down and pick right back up . enjoy this game as much as candy crush .
6 pieces does not a puzzle make . at least , for adults . and only one puzzle . who sets up these games ? i deleted this one .
this game is really fun i like how u have to unlock different games . and to get certain games you have to get a certain score . and i like the challenge .
every one make a rate on this i love this game if u love or like put 5 stars please
.you have hours of fun playing this game . ca n't stop playing it at all love , love , love this game . you will too .
this is a very fun and addictive game . i highly recommend it . it plays well on my kindle fire . love it
i really enjoy this game . i have n't played all the modes , but adventure mode is fun , but makes you think and plan .
nice game fun to play . good time killer . easy for kids and adults to play . god way to relax the body but stretch the mind .
scary as hell but i like the title music i put head phones on so i can hear better and get a good experience of slender man
fun game overall , though it got difficult faster than it should ... it is still a very fun puzzle game . four stars , definitely .
i like this app . the graphics & amp ; layout is easy to navigate . keep improving . download , its worth it . enjoy & amp ; happy watching .
i love it it is great for kids . any . age if u rate . u get a free hint even if u rate it on facebook and its not hard or easy
it is a very app and seeing that i love horses , i love this app so much . the horses are nice to take care of .
i thought it was something else , i made a mistake and i wish i could get rid of it real bad .
played for a little bit then got off and now it wo n't open . plus it wo n't log into facebook . fix and i 'll give s better review .
i did do a fortune and you have to pick three things ( it does random things first ) and i could n't see the third thing so if i were you i would not get this stupid app
its a nice game to waste some time on but your going to get bored and uninstall . not the best game to install
pretty much the same as all other match 3 puzzels , but it will pass the time of day for entertainment
very good game . is addicting the only thing is the waiting to get grabs . recommend it to help pass time .
not enough side games . it gets boring after a while . good graphics . has good potential to be better and more competitive .
if you like word puzzles you will spend hours playing this game . the graphics are not exactly & quot ; stunning & quot ; but it 's not really necessary when playing this type of game .
very good ! i like it because it stimulates your brain . helps you to interact with your friends and others playing this game .
it lets you connect and use your netflix account to watch the movies and shows you want . no issues found .
habit forming , makes you think . some of the clues are really hard to figure out which can make the game very frustrating .
a whole lot of fun ! easy to play and addicting as well ! a must play for the whole family ! i definitely recommend this game .
i said it is not good because you have to buy all the room and you just play with one do n't get
i do n't care i love it this app is great it 's nice that they have free apps that are n't crappy
this game is really fun . it is somewhat like cartoon wars except u can be someone , so its better . i definately reccomend this app to everybody .
this is a fun game . i highly recommend it as a way to help keep your mind sharp . challenging fun for the whole family .
so far the game is really easy . the graphics are just ok. i do n't like the fact you have to pay for levels , but i enjoy the game so i 'll continue playing .
i have played a game that is similar to this one . out of both games this one is the best . thank you very much .
deleted , never figured out how to play , no instructions , i must be too old or stupid , deleted it from my kindle
very great game for kids . it 's enjoyable and awesome . i would get this game because it 's very fun . hey this g game
this should be called a trial ! you 're not getting a free game , you 're getting a trial of the real game . i like the game , but the description is misleading .
good game a little short need the next chapter soon . want to know what happens . the waiting is killing me
nice game . great graphics . soothing background music and good story line . plus its free ! what could be better than free ?
no good for nothing . useless , just another useless application . i & apos ; m glad people do reviews like android tells you read reviews to avoid useless apps like this one .
was not sure about this game . fun but froze up several time . i had to download this twice . after it was great . finding items , and trying to figure the mystery was great .
even as a free game this was so boring , and it froze all the time . i got it thinking it would be something funny to let my husband play , but it was n't . i deleted .
it was difficult to figure out and maneuver , not as much fun as thought it would be . not as expected .
neat app but it is only interesting the first time you view it . kind of a waste of technical genius .
fun game to play to waste time . the controls are a little hard to get use to at first but after awhile it gets easier
seems to work fine . i ugly have not had any issues . i do not plan to use it that much .
this so far is the best dozer game i 've played but why do the coins max out ? i think you should be able to collect as much as you want .
excellent source for time zone reference and travel planning . i have loaded my areas of interest and can reference times at any time of the day .
the game was slow and easy at first then harder . only 10 levels for free then you have to pay for each level . that kind of stinks .
i like this game and so does my son . i would highly recommend this app to anyone who has a android phone . my wife loves this as well .
the game is okay . plays pretty well on kindle fire hd . i don ' t like that you have to purchase coins to continue to play .
this game is so fun to play and it it really addictive . i just can not stop playing this game . i think that it is way better then the first one i played . love this game .
this is the only weather app i use and trust . it 's very reliable . great app with great nice new features .
fun , entertaining , different types of slots . the best part about this is that you are almost always a winner . it 's fun and entertaining at the same time .
i really enjoyed the game . i 'm still having fun with it today . i enjoyed it so much that i ordered the pc version .
this was a free app that will keep you busy . it is not always my go to app but for being free i am glad i downloaded it although i do n't use it that often .
i 'm a dog lover , so this puts a smile on my face when i show this off to others . all thinks it is special .
great game to pass among friends and family , terrific way to bring family together . played with my 7 year old nephew , great fun !
this is a really great app . i learned how to draw many things from this app . i love this app .
i am not very good at this game but i really like a challenge when playing a game , sometimes there are two of us guessing until we solve it .
after first use crashes every time i open it . thought it would be a fun interesting app which it would be if it worked like its supposed to
this app does n't have the kind of photos i wanted to use as wallpapers , etc . it is okay though just not what i wanted .
i think this would be a great game except that it keeps freezing up and stops working in the middle of the game . and because it does i am not keeping it .
this game is as fun to play as cut the rope . it 's fun to play when you want to something and you do n't want to spend any money .
ok. my friends are obsessed with this app so of course i had to get it . its a cool app and is easy to use .
this game is great . very tough competition . only complaint is that when racing online , the standard and the pro version races for the same levels ca n't race each other .
i like it . and it 's fun . and the levels are interesting . i like the character design . and it 's entertaining . it 's worth getting .
it is just like angry birds but you only get the black bird that blows up . it gets boring fast .

a super fun game . after a while it gets a little to complicated for this older player . it has 3 levels but even easy gets hard .
my personal opinion of this game is that it is boring . however i am not a big fan of this type of game .
i use this app to find books for myself and my granddaughter who is 3. i never fail to find something good for us both .
great range - free - variety - free - continuously challenging - free - stimulating and free ! i love it .
i like that you are n't playing against a hundred people so you actually have a chance at getting bingo . also has a lot of extras that keep the game exciting .

i have had temple run many times before on other devices , but it works best on kindle fires ! great game , no ads , pretty good !
this game as a great story line . well worth the money . big fish as done it again ! i love all big fish games .
keeps you on your toes , have to find and create items to find clues to open the next stage not boring .
it has alot of pictures and funny things to send people . i would recommend it to adults and there kids .
very fun . like the interaction with the little people . good for wasting time . if you like building your own world games this is a must .
this is a pretty good game ! the graphics are good for a free app . the kids and i really enjoy it .
if you enjoy tetris usually this is a good app for the kindle fire . it is pretty similar to the regular games we used to always play . i never had any problems with it at all .
great way to waste your time , play the machine or play an opponent . i just do n't believe every roll is random and that i am always playing a real live opponent some place .
my favorite alarm clock app . i & apos ; m really happy that it & apos ; s the free app of the day ; i was planning on buying it anyway and i just saved some cash !

so soothing and relaxing no glitches or anything it is so cool and so r the options of the noises
i absolutely love this app . it works amazingly well doing what i need it to do . it is number helpful . one of the best simple apps i have gotten .
when i pick this up , i ca n't put it down . it 's awesome . i ca n't wait to get more . ready to try the hard level .
its a great game on the kindlefire . its very fun and runs smooth . it can also be very addictive and pass the time quickly .
i think its a wonderful game that has incredible graphics and has a level of difficulty . i think its suitable for any age .
useful but not as clean master . a very basic app , can be used but not very appealing . give you just little more control .
this is a amazing game it works great on my android tablet and is sooooooo much fun , you should get this app
i really thought this game was going to be really bad . the only reason i got it was to compete with my sister , but in the end it turned out to be a great game .
excellent story line , with good graphics . game occupied you for a long time with great clues that keep you on the right path and very involved . one of the best games i have played .
the games are simple but lots of fun . when you hit a great hit you get so excited . i would recommended it .
at first i thought this game was too easy but it really gets challenging as you continue to play . it is fun and causes you to think . great game if you like word games .
graphics are great . really makes u think . needs more levels and hints for when you are really stuck ! great app .
this is a great game for passing some time or if you are a fan of shooters . controls are responsive and simple to learn .

this game is so fun but i hate when your prizes you are about to get fall off the edge but this game is so much fun
love it 's awesome : ) runs smooth with no problems . used a one before this one & liked it but not as much as this one . ended up uninstall it & installing this one .
its a bad app . it does n't even do anything whatsoever . i do not recommend wasting even a second thought on this app .
if you loves super mario bros , you will surely love this game ! awesome game . i feel 8 yrs old again . ( i 'm in my 30 's )
this games is a gear game . it looks like it is made for kids but adults will like it too it as many different levels with new tricks to make it a different challenge .
i did not like the selection . it seems to be completely free though . just not the right app for me i suppose . i was hoping for something more .
so realistic just wish it had more to do when beginning kind of boring and it would be better if you could make money and gems easier ! ! !
this game gets your mind thinking about the pictures and the answer . you have to play it for yourself to see .
great for kids and adults specially if you have a bingo addiction . love how you do n't have to wait all day for more coins like other bingo apps .
a must for any yahoo fantasy football addict ! quality beats iphone and droid phone , second only to the website itself
fun game . i think it is a good way to test the brain a little bit having it a timed game .
this is a fun story and it reads the book to your child . my 4 yr old loves it and has read it more times than i can count .
not the best game in the world . it does pass time when you are bord though . i would not recommend getting it .
this game is not easy once you make it past the first few levels . yet it is pretty addictive and plays great on the phone as well as the kindle or other tablets .
i 've been playing pogo games for several years . i was pleased i could get it for my kindle . i do n't have to have my computer with me anymore to play . very pleased
i like this app i just wish we had more to choose from and that all the books were free .
have this on my phone , so i put it on the fire for the heck of it . far easier to use on the kindle fire with the larger touch screen .
fun to play . wish i could keep going , but i wish there was a way to undo a match instead of just switching what you match it with
i had no idea how great candy crush saga looks ! the app store made it convenient to install and i am enjoying my game play more than ever .
somewhat interesting but very similar to family farm which is much better and engaging .
i really like this game . it makes u think about the shows we watch to think of the scenes . great job

i just ca n't put this game down ! it 's really fun and original . the only minor complaint i have is there is no music , but that 's fine .
this magazine app looked very interesting . it 's not . if you want full access you have to pay , and it 's not cheap !
when i tried this app i thought it was really accurate to my mood and it was kinds cool . that id why i 'm giving it 4 stars .
not bad . the controls are decent on my droid x. the game wo n't blow your mind , but it 's worth a dollar for a little time killing here and there .
addictive gameplay . cute graphics . this ones a classic that never goes out of style . cant wait for grandson to get a bit older so he can play
easy to use for study projects . it is accurate and easy to maneuver . like to be able to access at any time .

deleted this because i could n't get the pieces to rotate ... ... there are much better puzzle apps out there so keep looking !

its pretty fun ... it gives me something to do to pass the time . gets addicting trying to keep on getting the high score .
good game . gives out points pretty easy . like the rest of the games . has a weekly challenge that gives you points to enter drawings with . bingo is my favorite though .
i would give this game five stars but , sometimes the screen turns all blue and i cant see what i 'm doing its really annoying .
i have only played for about 5 minutes so far , but so far it seems like a great game . fun , challenging but not too hard . i think i will enjoy this game .

i put this on my kindle so my grandkids could play and keep them busy . they love it so does grandma
i liked this because it was simple and not a lot of rules , but yet entertaining and makes you have to think a little once the levels go higher ,
this is a game that i got really board with . i found that there was really nothing to do , or any kind of challenge for me .
it was really fun but one time it updated and deleted all my money , stuff , and i had another granny : ( i would still say it 's pretty fun.i would give it a 4
i use this when im travelling and it work very well for me . i also use it at home so i do n't change my work alarm clock .
this game is so addicting i can play this all day . this is the funnest game that i have ever played on my kindle fire .
well i do watch it live on tv daily but the app is useless to me its not updated and shows old news from weeks or several days old ... .not for me i guess .
it 's easy for my grandkids to pick up the skills needed to play this game . good for quiet time or rainy days .
nothing is better at the end of a crazy day than being able to pin on my fire ! good app and easy to use !
loved playing this beautifully built hidden object game . has lots of puzzles to keep you busy . i would love more games like this .
i usually scroll through the top 100 free but this made it so much easier and it lets you know when there 's a limited time freebie which is awesome ! must get this .
the game is ok. not too challenging , according to my grandson , but i can not keep the load on long enough .
i do n't know if i will like this one or not . i 'm currently using a couple of their other ones first .

when i first seen i thought was just a copy cat but you actually take care of the cat . it is amazing ...
i first saw this game during last week on my friends ipod it was awesome and its one of the best types of games ever it is worth your time for sure : ) : )
this would be a great game if it would load faster , but it takes a very long time to load . sometimes you just want to play nor wait forever to load .

i use this on a kindle fire . it is great ! the display is very adequate for the size of the screen .
so far i 'm loving this game . i can see that it is a game that can occupy a lot of time and that can be a good thing or a bad thing !
this game is fairly simple for adults , but would be great for young kids . too bad there are few games like this for adults .
this was a very good game , my grand sons play this game all the time , it keeps them busy on the kindle
it is great . on a kindle fire and a ipad . disney made a super great game . everyone should play this game !

nothing but the temperature . well it was free so no loss . already deleted it . i can watch the weather channel .
having a yes these games before i had already known that you would end up paying to play the whole game .
this is a challenging game . the graphics are very detailed . the min games are challenging . i would recommend this game .
i could n't get this to work , but i 'm sure that 's not a fault of the app , probably just my not understanding how to work it .
awful . it is another very time wasting and pointless game . i strongly recommend that you do not buy it . it is just awful once again .
always played yahtzee back when , so this is very easy to learn & plan strategies , nice job . adults and kids will enjoy this .

great way to catch up on international news . now i need twelve more words before i can post this comment .
i love this game but the only problem that i have is that you can not play a full game you have to buy why so sad but over all good game ... .
i did n't care for this app because i could n't find many episodes . the shows were mostly just clips . some of the other channel apps have full episodes of their best shows .
i personally did n't really the game , but it is so addicting . as much as i did n't really like it i could n't put it down ! so , i give it 4 stars .
some answers come easy , giving you a place to start with the more difficult clues . a good balance and good fun too .
this is the first time i have installed an app that just wo n't play . it actually loaded once i tapped play and then it was gone . so i will be removing it .
good game , but gets hard sure you have to get new units but you can get more money by playing online .
at first the game is almost too easy but as you progress through the levels it becomes quite challenging . fun to play with a group or just to pass time .
had it on my phone & was hoping to get on my kindles . yes ! very adicting ! ! sometimes hard to get to next levels .
it was a very fun game , i really think people will like it and should be willing to only spend there time to download and play this game .
i lost my tablet to my wife because she 's always now using it for playing this game . should n't have told her how to get to the amazon store
did not work on samsung galaxy s3 . installed and reinstalled several times trying different downloads and settings . if i try again i will note it here .
same as above , i can not afford to spend money on these games to get to a further level , sorry about that .

this game is fun and challenging . runs great on the kindle fire . i would recommend to anyone who likes word games .
would new recommend this . it is a little confusing . may just not be the kind of challenge that i like .
great game . kind of quirky with the country scenes and the music but it is another great hidden object game .
my 5 year old loves all these dress up type apps . she never seems to get bored of them . simple app to use .
very good game easy to play keeps you interested and wanting to come back for more not hard to play easy to figure out
this app is totally worth the money and it is a great time waster . i love it ! anyone who is considering getting it really should .
this app constantly locks up during the advertisements . i have to go to the abc website on my pc to watch the programs . this has happened on 5 different shows . very frustrating !
i do n't have a lot to say about this game . it bored me . it might be very entertaining to some people who have a lot of patience but that 's not me .
i love this game as do my kids and husband ! we have it on every device in our house ! lol
better payouts ! better graphics ! better game ! more fun all around ! and free is always better ; ) highly recommended for all slots players !
i love this app it is my favorite app ever ! i think people should stop complaining about the ads . ads do n't matter when your having fun !
not too hard . not too easy . this game has just the right combination of fun and thinking ! please add more levels soon !
this is another mahjong that really enjoy . anyone would really like to play this . i have to concentrate on hat # 's . good for anyone and any age .
there were not many options for clothes , the game was just terrible ! there was no quality or time put into this game ! not worth your time !
very good game . keeps you occupied for hours . easy to use . this game is a lot of fun and i highly recommend it !
total logic fun ! especially love the 15 x 15 - what a challenge ! liked it so much i got another flippix art - zoo
i love it ! ! ! ! ! it 's awesome ! i was looking in the recommended apps for me and here it was . you need to down load now ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
i love how this plays better on my kindle fire than on my computer . thank you for the free app !
this is a cool game for anyone who likes bingo it is a fun and relaxing game that you can play
it seems to have a lot hidden object puzzles . i guess i need to just buy the game in order to give an accurate review .
i was not impressed with this app despite the fact i love hidden object games . would not recommend this app
this game is pretty cool . different from most match games but i like it . requires a little strategy which brings out the challenge in me to keep on playing .
i think you have to buy additional lives on this . might be good as a group game . i do n't have much to say about this .
i enjoy playing g this game because it lets me be a horse owner while not actually own a horse
not worth your trouble . unless you are 5 and then it might hold attention for two or three minutes . sorry .
the game just does n't work all of the time , it freezes a lot and sometimes you ca n't even open it .
kept me occupied a lot longer than most games of the same genre , liked all the different types of puzzles in it .
this app is great to use because you can easily learn to play a guitar when you have no idea how . i recommend you to get this app . it 's also free ! !
i love this flash light i am up a lot at night and its better then turning on lights in the house
like this game , just wish ya did not have to wait so long for chips . and can only purchase with real money .
fun game to kill time . wish it was not so expensive and i would love to buy it . hoping to get more free coins so i can buy it
a lot of fun , great way to pass the time . some puzzles can be difficult to solve , but with each puzzle you learn more to help solve the other puzzles .
enjoyable fun lots of levels to master free coin every 4 hours lots of free coins on facebook friends can send free coins friends can also send free spins
why ? what is the point of this ? it dose not even make noise ! ! ! just save yourself the storage space on your device and pass on this one .
an ok hidden object app not as good as some though . i have so many that i dont play this one as much as others .
i am addicted and ca n't wait to get the next game . these games are so fun and actually unwind me .
fun game , like a lot of bubble shoot games . it 's slow sometimes which causes multiple shots which is not good . no instructions , which is a hassle
i do n't play to many games on my cell but i love this game ! ! the biggest problem is that its too darn addictive , i ca n't put it down once i start ! ! ! !
i only have two words to say about this app ... does n't open . it looked like it might be fun if it would open .
the levels need to give you little hints about how to get out because i get stuck a lot . the game is good for something that is free .
i really like this logo game . they are a different look for pics . i like the icon look . it has multiple levels also .
i got the games for my friends children when they come over this game is like by them all . would recommend it after watching them play the game .
it 's not worth a dollar . questions seem like poor translations from another language . wish i could limit questions to shows i actually watch .
me and my grandson and granddaughter like to play this game and he always beats me with a higher score .
i wish i had n't ordered this one . i find myself completely bored with it . i suppose if you are into playing slot machines it would be fun .
adware ! ! if i could i would give it negative stars come on people beware do n't download . with so many bible games out there why this
i really like this game even more so than the others i played . i have learned so many words and the pictures give them meaning .
addicting game that my daughter likes to play . helps with coordination skills and problem solving . would recommend this game to a friend .
the game is great . does anyone know how many levels it has . i can see myself playing it for 100 's of levels .
game plot was good and puzzles were challenging . i would have liked to have more of the picture puzzles where you have to figure out how the picture goes together .
a relaxing game that is not too hard or too easy . it is worth buying . a good way to spend those spare minutes .
do n't have much to say about it . it 's fun and simple of use . i will definitely recommend it . my kid 's loves it .
i enjoy the old style bingo offers , the problem that i have with the game is the time in between the calls . i enjoy a much faster paced game .
a great game on my kindle it fun addicting dosent require wifi to play can get cool cars fun i great recommend getting
i like this game ! but what i dislike it only drops 4 coins instead of 5. and you have to reach level 50 before you can play the other 2 games that come with it .
this is a fun game to kill time with . good graphics . who does n't like shooting things ? i also like the fact there are n't pop up ads .
a very simple to use and very functional application . i decided not to buy a stop watch based on the functionality of this very neat app .
perfect tool for keeping up to date with all of my pinterest activities . thank you so much for this cool app .
i picked this game because i enjoy playing freecell . i do n't always win but it is fun to try to beat the computer .
need more pieces to the puzzles . the puzzles are no more then 20 pieces and not very interesting . i should not complain for a & # 34 ; free game & # 34 ; .
great app so far . will update later . the only problem so far is alarm sound is to low . even when turned up .
the app runs smooth and it does exactly what is advertised . graphics are ok. we 've seen this game many times . there is nothing that makes this one stand out .
i play this on fb almost everyday . you have to use strategy to figure out how to improve your score . love mind games
this game is a fun one to play . the songs are catchy . very enjoyable ! it is a really good free game .
this is a great bingo game ! good pace and lots of action . it has fun prizes too . i like the fact you can win bingo chips to buy more cards . : )
this game really makes you think . it has great graphics and easy use . you wo n't be disappointed with this game .
as above , worth getting for a change of pace . it is find the number you need and press . never changes .
it has work awesome for me love everything about it if you need a bible for your kindle i would say this would be the one for you : )
love these types of games . fun to play . maybe if it was a little faster pace , it would be better .
this game is very fun and addicting . it 's hard to stop playing it . i would recommend this game to anyone .
this game is great way to exercise your mind . all towers are different and create a different challenge . i like that they have daily puzzles to solve .
and i can see it being quite useful for some people . i just spent a few minutes trying it , and surely like it a lot .
perfect for grandsons or your little guy - i downloaded it for that reason will get you both laughing easy to use varied sounds
there were many challenging puzzles and some way too easy . it was fun to play though does not take too long to finish .
this app is a really good but sometimes really inappropriate but other than that it is a good app lol
i like the new game . it is cool that they have new ideas for every holiday . i have found that i am excited everytime i go online to see what new challenges and tasks there will be .
love playing the game but it is difficult to get others to do the second round of the fast money . if not for that , i would had given 5 stars .
i can not get this game to work on my kindle , it comes up but does not work . i may just need to mess with it some more for now it is just setting in the cloud .
i love this game its way harder than i thought lol . ive seen a lot of the logos but just cant seem to name them .
i love hidden object games so i am always looking for new games . this game is fun to play when you are bored
screen was to small to enjoy the game and see all the moves so i have all ready removed it from my kindle
i did not & # 34 ; hate it & # 34 ; just found it too confusing -- have this problem with several apps i download . directions must be somewhere i ca n't find
wide variety of movies , older , newer , cartoon and non . my kids and i really enjoy passing the time with this game !
you can only play one game of each casino unless you want to pay for tokens . the games are boring
i have played this before on the computer , great game . runs smooth on my note 2 , worth the down load
so violent and fun and is the only reason i wake up at 2 in the morning to play it
it was free ... how can someone complain ? i enjoy the game and the graphics are fine . i guess my expectations are not that great but i do n't find much to complain about .
it 's the same as all the other grid games -- match 3 icons and win points . i 'll stick with the old jewel games that i already have loaded .
i love sudoku ! this app is great - it has all the elements of a good sudoku app , including the ability to display hints when necessary .
great app ... perfect for preschool and beyond . fun to play as a single player or with a friend ! i have had no problems with it .
like all those endless running dreams , but with points and bonuses . and sometimes falling off the edge is actually funny .
this game is a great way to waste some time as well as to keep you entertained . i have always loved doing puzzles so this is great for on the go .
what a fun game ! build up & quot ; money & quot ; and advance to different levels to be able to play new slot games . would definitely recommend this to others !
i really like this game and spend too much time on it . i highly recommend this game to anyone who have a lot of time on their hands .
its really alot of fun it keeps you moving i like it alot back to feeling like a kid again
if you like games that make you come back get this game and make sure you know what your doing
great buy ! so many games of solitaire to chose from ... all with different styles an patterns ... . got ta luv it a good buy for my kindle !
it does what it 's suppose to . does n't do anything more , does n't do anything less . it is exactly what you 'd expect .
it finally gives me a chance to record videos on my kindle . it just makes my kindle much nicer than when 1st purchased ! thank you .
you get words with friends for free on the kindle fire and that the exact same thing as this is , since ot does n't have single player mode .
i love this game ! it is very addictive . i 've only played seven levels but once i start playing it 's hard to stop .
this app is great for me when i need a few minutes to chill and is my favorite board game so far .
this is entertaining just as most slots are ! they do not pay off as well as some . have fun playing .
love it alot , for myself and for the kids nice safe fun . good for age 5 and up to adult .
fun time killer , but every time i get to a high level it freezes , which is super frustrating ! ! i would n't pay money for it unless they fix that problem .
lot of fun . good way to pass the time . keeps you entertained for hours . i would recommend it for all ages .
i just opened it again to see if it is working . i got the up grade message clicked cancel and the page stayed up . clicked on match up and it worked . it 's updating and everything .
the graphics are beautiful and it 's easy to play . very user friendly ; even my grandkids can play it ! i like the battles .
tumblr is a great app to have if you like looking at photos . even if you like looking at your photos or looking other peoples photos ... ... it 's a great app to have .
the food runs out so u cant level up and it did help my child eat but fun puzzles to play .
when ever i exit out of it , the music will keep on playing until i get rid of it . and i also luv it .
i was having a lot of problems with & quot ; program is not responding & quot ; messages . i reinstalled it and works fine now .
the is just too good to be on the kindle fire : ) ps if your wondering if you should buy this the answer is yes !
great game . it 's amazing how many logos you do n't recognize . the international ones are the hardest . i would buy this game .
at first i thought it might be a childish game but as the levels go higher it does get harder its a really cute game im glad i got it
i have spent hours playing this game . the colors hold my attention and the game goes quickly . i would recommend this to anyone who likes solitaire .
this app is amazing . it is up to date and i cant believe all throw things i see . this app is worth $ 0.99 cents i recommend this app
i enjoyed the game , only thing i did n't like about it it did n't have a built in strategy guide . i think the game would have been more enjoyable .
entertaining and challenging . the only downside is that it was only 16 levels . finished it in about two hours . if you 're gon na charge , make it a little more worthwhile .
i like this game because it 's challenging and you can go back to beat your own time . it keeps record of what your time was before and i like that .
super fun and very adicting . so many colors to choose from . it will keep you occupied for many hours . really should download !
i like it that there are both easy puzzles and challenging ones ! one of the better 4 pics 1 word games i have tried
i really suggest this game for little kids my lil sister love this th game thank u doctor panda this is from all kids
a really fun game . have a lot of missions , levels and challenges with tough enemies on it . you will never get bored with it ! .
i like it i wish i can keep as my wallpaper instead of the advertisements i get . very pretty and bright
i love this game , if you love to think then you will love this game too , it really makes your mind think about the riddles that they put in front of you . thanks what the riddle ?
this match 3 can be difficult in 3d . really fun to play . easy load go ahead the price is right !
can not wait to get to a higher level . absolutely addictive . simply a real joy to play with the kids .
this app freezes up on my kindle fire right at the very beginning levels . could not even get through the tutorial part fully . waste of money ... why is this even available on fire ?
this is a great game and a fun time killer .. challenging to play but still fun .. well worth paying for ..
as school i do math and i run in to fractions so this app makes it easy to do the fractions
this game is sooooooo much fun ! i love playing everyday ! it 's not to hard but not to easy , the graphics are cute , and it is an all around fun game .
its a fun game just takes alot of patience to earn work experience . and i need friends so add me please ! ! !
this game is great for passing time . i return over and over . ca n't beat that it 's free to boot . very easy for a wide age variety .
this game starts off fairly easy , but gets more and more difficult as it goes . it is fun and challenging . a great brain exercise .
i chose this rating because once i started playing it i could n't stop ... it is very addicting ... ... .i love it ... ... .i love the match three games ... .
u have to get this game it is exactly like the movies and books but u do n't have enough energy
it 's a great game to share with the young one and it 's also fun to draw by myself , there 's so many choices .
i have n't received my vegas slots order to my kindle , so i do not know how to rate please help me
well , i have only used this app once so far but it seems to be pretty good . i like it . would recommend .
really enjoy this game . have it on my kindle fire and it works great . it has n't froze up like some games really like it .
has a ton of pictures , am easily able to share on my facebook wall when i need help , you earn coins quickly , and the best part is that it 's free !
love this game because i love to look for the hidden objects in this game . i would recommend this game to anybody who likes to look for any objects .
it works well . since kindle does n't have gps it 's not quite as good as maps on my phone , but i would recommend it .
i played this game a long time ago when i was in school , and found it again as i was searching apps , i love this game and so do my kids .
this app is fantastic especially when you have 3 little brothers . ; ) and all the colors really entertain a 1 year old . its fun no matter how old u r .
it is simple , too the point and perfect for little kids ! i did n't get into it but he liked it .
my daughter loves to draw it keeps her busy and the price was right i love my kindle so many things you can do with it
i ca n't play it very long because it becomes real easy for me ! i guess i should upgrade it may be harder !
this game is like the best game ever . if you have n't seen or played it yet then your missing out .
good mystery , locate clues to further game , hidden object scenes , and a variety of other type puzzles . i thought it worth 2.99 i paid .
pictures too dark or too small to find items , i had another member of the family try it with the same results
i downloaded it to try and get movies and tv shows but those do n't work well with my tablet . i have a clone android .
game played fine for a while . but then freezes and forces close a lot . but as far as game play it was a good game .
yes , this game is nearly impossible . but very addicting . maybe i 'll eventually be able to get past level 2 . ( :
ca n't really say too much about it . we never played because it 's so huge we stopped the download . not worth it .
this is ok and since it was free i do n't want to say bad things about it . but it is just ok .
this game is like mario and i like how the ads do n't appear . its really cool because now you can play something like mario on the go
i really like this game because i 'm really good at it so that is why i like it so much i also play a lot so yeah
i absolutely love the animated dinosaurs . however on my kindle fire , it lags , a lot . other than that , get the game . it is well worth the one dollar .
want a bigger brain ? keep the one you got going strong ? this is a great app for you to use !
it 's pretty fun , great controls , cool graphics , definitely recommend this to any racing fan . i play it in my free time . five out of five .
i do n't see anything wrong , its just a little blood , nothing to complain about . its pretty fun , i have beaten three levels by now , its addicting .
the game would be less frustrating if it had a way to gain more time . otherwise some levels are too difficult
i got stuck on it and unable to complete . i removed it from my tablet at this time and may try finishing it later .
i liked it a lot it is a great strategy game but the free version really is limited and only a few minutes of play time before you can restart from the beginning . still fun
this is a pretty good ap the only flaw is you ca n't save the gun you hard on or maybe not
i enjoy this game because it makes me think and it is a lot of fun . i did not realize there were so many steps .
this is a great game and i have really been enjoying it . smooth playing and fast paced , i highly recommend this game for all .
just disappointed is all tried another one and it was much better just seek and you shall find the right one
this was quickly addicting for me . i am playing one more time before bed . the higher levels take more thought so it 's not mindless . great app . htc thunderbolt
i have been playing this game for years and have always loved it . i really enjoy that they have put in more game rooms and more power ups . i can also play it on my kindle .
do n't get this app ! i got this app and you have to download the full version to use the scientific part ! not worth it
this app is good because you can look at people places and things that you might not normally be able to see . plus you can control some of the cameras .
this is such a rip off of temple run . i mean , even the names r somewhat the same ! this app is n't even free ! whats up with that ! this app totally sucks
i also could not download on my kindle ! ! very frustrating and i hate wasting money , please fix . usually love big fish games
these papi games r so much fun to play . they never get boring . this on is my favorite . i recommend this ! : )
this app is really nice and easy to use . i enjoy using it and i love how pinterest just gives me so many ideas and great advice .
this game gets you hooked with the colors and the objective it wants you to achieve . this is a mind challenging game but it is sooooo much fun ! ! !
this is a lot of fun but the controls can be a bit challenging so make sure to get some training before you get in real deep
we use this app every night to get to sleep . i use to use the sleep timer but now we use it throughout the night . love this app !
why use this ? when the phone already does every single thing this app does without wasting more space and battery ?
i like that this game is very challenging . it took me a while to get the hang of it , but once i did , cool .
love this one . play it every chance i get . it also is very challenging . like to see the egg fall .
one of my favorite ways to play word games with my friends . i have many games going all the time . love it ! !
distracting diversion when you need to kill some time . this game is a very challenging , fun picture guessing game . love all the new pictures .
like this calculator for the visual , but it is functional , too . artwork changes from day to day or can pick from gallery : )
this app is real good and let you keep your numbers you should try it out is the best that i see in it is very good
the games really just did n't have any appeal to me to keep playing and keep the app . i really got board with it after and hour .
ok so it is a great game but sometimes will not give up the object even after the hint says it 's there ...
i love this game although i had to pay for the upgrade i think it should have been free but it is still a very fun game : ) ) ) ) ) ) )
i can not select my friends to play with , often 1 of the players leaves the game and i have to start all over again .
a straight forward , old school , puzzle adventure game . puzzles can be difficult but there is an easy to use hint system . nice music .
your babies and pets and sims need care and love . the game is lots of fun my granddaughter loves it .
the game is fun and addicting . i do n't like how few free coins you get and wish the coin bar was larger . i know this is a business but come on guys .
this game is great for small kids they get to have fun with there favorite animals i would get this game for your kids
very fun cooking game for family and friends i would recommend this game for all ages . i absolutely love this game ! ! !
once you get use the the kindle , new to me , this one is really good and easy to manage , now looking for a good solitaire game .
i like have a notepad on my kindle for my monthly bills . so i know how much i 'm spending and have left over .
very good to use when an app does n't want to be uninstalled the normal way . works very well . great app
i like this one but the puzzles are a little hard for my 2 year old grandsons . puzzle pieces are too small for toddlers . i think i will be great when they are a little older .
it looks like the real thing . it 's simply fun ! i do n't know what else to say about this game . it does n't challenge my mind , but i like to play it quite often .
the game is confusing at first , it seemed to take me forever to figure out what i was supposed to do . but once i figured it out i was hooked ! loving it !
game play is quick and intuitive . graphics and sound all great . finished the game in 90 minutes which is why i took 1 star off . but , highly recommend !
nice app to have to quickly pull up the weather conditions for your town , and others . it seems to be in sync with the news channels , and can be checked at anytime .
fun to play . love the drawings and watching me hang -- lol the first couple of times . still makes me smile when i play the game .
i did not care for this game . i do n't think this is my type of game . i just could n't get into the game at all . i will not be trying this again .
i really enjoyed this game . i bought the full game and i have really enjoyed playing it . its not too difficult or too easy . i recommend this game .
i thought the graphics were good and the plot held my attention . i would recommend this game to others . none of these games are 100 % free but i think it is worth the money .
it has very beautiful pictures and i think i will like it better on this larger screen . interesting pictures . so much to do .
this game is loads of fun with clues and puzzles . great and time well spent . i could n't stop playing . great for anyone
i love it the game is very addicting there should be more apps like this . i love the bonus 's . please make more like this
okay this game is fun but challenging if you do n't use the hints . yes this game is slightly creepy but hello look at the name but it is not over the top scary .
i have been waiting for this app on here and i am so excited it is finally here . pinterest gives you so many amazing ideas and lets you tell others about your ideas ! !
love the hbo go app , i can see my favorite shows and movies at any moment without having to wait a set schedule on cable . it is easy to download and use , definitely recommend it .

i got game for my cousin . she liked it i did n't care much for it . after a while i deleted the game .
my kids and i both loved messing with this app . it was really fun to make all the different designs and stuff !
awesome game ! the guy is so cute great that you can change him and his clothes but it grows slightly repetitive after a while but still cute : )
i got this for my kindle fire and you can personalize it enough to make it useful . it 's great for relaxing , meditation or just getting to sleep .
this app actually works . and you can even adjust how much extra boost you need . plus its free . thumbs up
very nice graphics . fun to play . hints are available if needed . a very good hidden object game . easy to play .
well first of all when it says hot or not would like to access , i press ok , then it does n't connect , what 's wrong , fix the app ! ! !
fun game . gets u to thinking ! very easy instructions and starts out easy and gets harder . great game for when u have a few minutes to kill .

it 's a blast to play and is very fast . it 's easy fun everytime . my kids are addicted to it big time .
i love the game ... ... once it gets started . takes to long to get started even after it gets downloaded . very disappointed : (
the solitaire for kindle fire was fun and very easy to play . i would have to give it a five star rating based on the fun factor and as close as you would get to playing solitaire alone !
my boyfriend got this ap for himself but my 8 year old niece has hours of fun playing this really addictive game .
this is a fun puzzle game you ca n't put down . takes a little brain work on getting some of the puzzle pieces off the board . my 14 year old loves it as much as i do .
never used it so i can not say it works great or if it sucks . so i will give it 3 stars
i thought that it was a very basic program and since i am not into reading comic books ... i deleted it .
this is fun and fairly easy . the graphics are great . i like playing just to relax and who does n't like popping bubbles ? : )
love playing word games , and it 's great to play games with others that like to play the same thing . thanks
my grand children love this for drawing pictures . they are always asking if they can draw on my kindle fire

i love to play this game and do n't always have someone to play it with me and i love playing against the computer .
love this game . playing on kindle fire and works great . great graphics and game play . lots of levels that get increasingly challenging . awesome that this was offered as the free app of the day .
used to be a very good app and a good time killer . now i have to pay for single player .
this game is challenging . it starts out easy and then gets really challenging . a good way to stimulate your brain . i love it .
it 's on the amazon store and it is so much fun ! there 's so much levels ! i ca n't believe it was free ! i highly recommend this game
did n't find it very interesting but i am sure many people will , is not bad specially if you can it free .
this game is very fun i gave it 5 * i finished this game in 1 hour i wish i had more money because i what the full version
good game . fun building stuff in a different way . watching the people get into a fight is hilarious . have not been forced into buying the in app purchases yet .
i chose this game because i have temple run and temple run 2. i was not disappointed at all . in this app . just as exciting .
i love playing it because it is such a challenge . but it can be so addictive you just do n't want to stop .
i was not too fond of this app . i enjoy playing this game but this was not as exciting as i was hoping
i love this game ! it is addictive but not to the point that you have to purchase more lives . it goes quickly and is super fun .
easy to use , fairly user-friendly , i have no complaints about this app . word word word word and another word word .
very good game . good pictures for adults and kids . my grandkids love these types of games . so far no bugs in the game .
i love hockey but i do not like this game the kindle is usually fast and way faster than the i pad but this game stinks do not get it !
i like this one because it is a somewhat challenge . there are still some levels i have not reached yet . i would recommend it to everyone . i really like this one .
this app keeps me going on and on , sometimes keeps me up way past my bedtime and i never lose the desire to keep playing . it is one of the few that hold my interest .
first of all i bought it using coins ( what a waste ) it wo n't let me save and let me just say do not buy it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
i love this you get to pick what you want in sounds a nd create your own sounds as well .
once you achieve a certain level of play , you ca n't move forward without a purchase .
this would be a great game if it did n't shut down repeatedly . i played it for an hour and it shut down on me five times . a shame but a waste of your time .
i ca n't get my eyes off of this game ! its so awesome i love the tasks they give you ! i can not wait to make a family it sounds like the best part !
easy steps to follow , really cool art work . i enjoyed using this app to create the characters on the page . i never could have done that without this app . cool .
i think all the casino games are awesome ( some more than others of course ) . i do enjoy the slots most .
i purchased candy crush for my grandkids to use on my kindle but i find it very addicting and have been using it too !
it a fun but really really really really hard so be careful i hope u like this game it great
like this because i like doing word searches and this way i can pull one up anytime , anywhere without having to purchase anything or copy out of a magazine somewhere ; especially in waiting rooms : )
not fun at all . clues are not very good . some clues are too small and others are blurry . a waste
i love it , it is not to hard not to easy . and there are so many games to play , it is like unlimited games
a great game to lie around and play with a loved one . lots of fun , one of the best apps i 've purchased in awhile .
the game was ok , it was more fun hitting the guy then the apple . it was hard trying to hit the apple , so i hit the guy .
so far i am enjoying the app , not the same as the fb game but a fun alternative . takes a while to level up though and not much to do while waiting .
i like this game a lot but it will not let me connect to face book .but other then that i like this game .
far too basic in terms of castle defense games . the game play is n't fun and the graphics could be better . would not recommend it .
this is an awesome app ... everyone should use it . so many wonderful scripture lessons ... and the prayers are great . would recommend to anyone .
i like the game but i need to practice more because i am not able to serve all my customers sometimes i lose some
i love this game and play it a lot ! ! i love the sound effects and the little voice . it is fun and challenging ! i highly recommend it !
used a lot of memory , did n't down load properly was more trouble that it was worth deleted before playing - boo
this is a very helpful tool and has come in handy for me when i was not in the room with the computer
awesome and great graphics , way better then 1st one , and free the best price there is , keep it going with the great games
super fun and really easy but i wish there were more clothes and shoes . but what is there is cute especially for free .
there is absolutely no reason that i should have to be connected to the internet to play a silly puzzle game . uninstalled .
this app is awesome it wakes me up and i wake up to my fav song the picture is blurry but the sound is all that matter
this game is so much fun i wish they had more games just like this one that 's how great of a game this game is ha ha ha ha
guess song quiz is a really fun game if you like quizzes and/or music . but sometimes the piano version of the song sounds entirely different from the original song . but good luck ! z
this game is fun . it helps to pass the time when there is nothing else to do . i literally loss track of time while playing it .
very fun and addicting ! took awhile to get the hang of it on the big kindle fire 8.9 screen but still fun .
have played through this game , definitely keeping it to play through again at some point . it 's cute and not too complicated .
gets boring very soon . i quit after game was half over . try something more interesting . not for me . good try .
i love this game , i ca n't stop playing it . my daughter loves it also , she three and her scores are almost as high as mine .
if u do n't have any money u look like everyone else and u think u are a different player and die every time
i absolutely love this game ! its so fun ! i recomend it for anyone over the age of 6 . i have this game for my kindle fire .
i absolutely enjoy this game . the only problem i 'm having is the new easter room wo n't update . i heard through the chat that this happened the last time they tried to add this game .
my granddaughter 's biggest complaint about this game is that it took so long to build the houses and the park .
i download the app , but did not use it , because i had problem with it on my tablet , so i ca n't really comment on this
i tell myself i 'm going to sit for a couple of minutes and play ultimate jewel but find myself playing much longer ! it 's lots of fun and very enjoyable . recommended for all ages .
everybody loves bejeweled 2 , it helps me to focus so i do enjoy playing it . i think i play every day .
game seemed like it could be fun for a little while . played a few levels , but the controls were driving me crazy .
it gets boring . but overall a good game and i recomend it . i think i just played it to much lol . # addicting
have no use for this right now , might need it later or when i learn how to use it , thats all for now
completely love it ... simple to use and to see even when i ca n't find my glasses ... lol ! ! i 'm glad that you can get it on the kindle fire !
love this game unlike some others i 've played this one is fast paced the missions are challenging but not ridiculously hard . definitely worth downloading .
i rarely play this game . it is a good game , but i get bored just clicking on it . my grandkids like it .
i like the game very addictive . beat it it in one day well less then a day a couple of hours . i wish there was a game that would at least take m a couple of days .
i 've been playing this game for quite a while and i really enjoy playing . i put it down and pick it right back up . before i know it , the day is gone .
i did n't like this very much . this just did not work for me . there are so many more options out there that work better .
i found this memory game was not only fun or created ! enjoyed playing with younger children & played for quite a while .
everytime i tried to login on the app it would just reload back to the blank login page . it lets me login on the computer , not sure why it wont on the app .
i like to play games while i am on my lunch break at work . not being able to turn the sound off really limits where the game can be played .
u should get this app because it was true about my friend . this app is really good it was also it was right about me too .
this app is a great game for people of all ages . there is a little something for everyone ! you should get this app .
i think it is a boss game , it keeps me happy when i 'm sad . this game helps with almost anything . i enjoy it and so will you if you get it !
just another & # 34 ; free & # 34 ; game that ends up asking for money !
a very satisfying past time before going to bed . my husband enjoys this game each day when he is stressed .
this game is fun and easy . relaxing to play . like the tiles . its worth the 99 cents . would buy it again .
i like hidden object games - this one is different than most . i am giving it a 5 rating even though i would like more in-game puzzles . great job big fish .
this game is pretty cool . its a little boring though ... ... ... ..i think the reward should be higher when you solve a word .
fun game but some answers are not realistic and the fast money round does n't reveal the top answers in the end .
one of my favorite bingo games , would really like to have more bonus credits . the bonuses should be given more than every 24 hours .
like most of these games it is very addicting . controls are easy enough just tapping . i have really enjoyed playing this game . works well on my kindle fire .
got this for my daughter and she got bored with it really fast . maybe for lil kids under 7 or so .
great great great really fun love it it 's about time they released it really enjoying it love it love it
if you love connect four this is the game for you . i have n't won against the computer yet ... but my son has , go figure .
it 's a lot of fun . there are so many outfits to choose from . i recommend it to anyone who likes fashion .
so far i have n't gotten very many books , but right now i 'm very happy with the application . and they seem to have a very large selection of different types of books .
fun cant stop playing i wish it was real money i need it ... i got up playing it . not on face book anymore but its still fun
what the heck ? all this app has is a couple of sounds that are n't even close to being annoying . this app is a waste of time .
this is somewhat easier than the original . i enjoy the challenge . i 'd certainly get it for relaxation . it allows you to move on much more quickly and you wo n't be bored .
the effects included work well but i dont see any real good use of these effects in real life . i would not buy again .
i love this app , i can check out my facebook account where ever i am and can get internet . everyone should have it .
this game is just like the show . has it all with out the pressure of being on tv .i highly recomend this one for any fan of the show , and anyone looking for a fun game .
what can i say its a giant calculator app that is free . it does its job for quick needing it
when you play this for the first time , it 's fun . but the replay value just goes down . the developer did a good job , but it could 've been a lot better imo .
this app does a lot . a lot of ways to keep ur notes .
i love the game . i have played it several times and will probably play again and again . it is very challenging .
a very informative news app to keep you update with what is happening around the world as well as in our country .
this falls right in there with letters from nowhere . another great game by g5 . recommend for almost all ages , younger children may find it difficult .
this game is so much fun it is good for when your bord it is a good game to play very fun
i have a kindle fire but it is to small for the screen . i am a big fan of hidden objects but have trouble seeing it .
even with a high score of 3 xd its a epic game because it makes u forget about whats happening around u , and if u like flappy bird , get this
my grand daughter love this app , this is very good for a 20 month old , i will buy more books like this .
i 've enjoyed playing this game a lot . the graphics and writing are excellent . the only problem is how long it takes for the energy points to recharge .
this is a great game to play for all ages . it is fun to see how many characters you can get from the image .
love being able to play with anyone from anywhere . hope you continue with this app and letting us play for free
this is an okay app . but could use better categories . even the & # 34 ; easy & # 34 ; setting is more challenging than some would like .
i love using this app ! it helps keep my mind sharp and now no matter where i am , i can do all kinds of calculations in my head ...
i really enjoy this game ... the graphics are amazing and it was free when i got it . ca n't beat that !
i love this app because you can play with your friends around the world . its awesome if you love scrabble you will love this game . hope this review helps . you will not be dissapointed ! !
can download my favorites and listen to it offline ... .. i love it and think you might too . have n't had any problems with it .
i love to solve riddles and this game has made it fun and easy . it is a game that i would recommend if you love word games and riddles .
this ap is easy 2 use and convenient . i highly recommend it . nothing extra to get in your way . no irritating ads .
almost as good as the app on facebook . put you and your friends in fun comic bit scenes . many to choose from . more added daily .
have always loved this game . nice challenging game . little harder than solitare . but i think everyone would enjoy playing this game . something to do by yourself .
i love this game it 's so much fun i play every day if i 'd change anything it would b for the prices to be better
grandson likes it , he plays it most of the time out of all the other games on the kindle . it is easy for a 1st grader
you can watch clips but if you want long shows log in and if you think this is a bad app think again free full shows and clips this app it worth more than free its a great deal
does not work on the samsung vibrant or the epic . instant force close when opening on both of the two phones .
great product and does more than just the non explorer edition . i would tell all my friends to use this edition . love it .
i love this app , but it is very frustrating for people like me ( total idiots ) . anyway , i got it for free but it is worth the money .
i enjoyed this version on the kindle just as much as my pc version . just like the other dash games it 's a little addicting .
the game was awesome and my kids really loved it and love to play it they have so much fun with it
lots of fun layouts but there is only one way to win , you do get several chances but i want to just win sometimes
love this game as much as the previous games in this series ! you wo n't be disappointed if you enjoy hidden object games .
since i did the first one this one is also good plenty of hidden things , story line is also good also .
it is a nice tool to create some casual art work . it is fun and easy to use . will recommend to friends .
i love pinterest , so having an app . on my kindle is very convenient and useful . definitely should try it if you 've never been on !
this is a great way to have a lot of fun . i have recommended this app to many people . kids really enjoy it .
great game allows you to pick different level of opponents to match your skills . if you enjoy the game of hearts this is the game to pick , would recommend it as great fun
my four year old grandson loves angry birds games of any type . this one is n't too hard for him and he enjoys playing it .
i gave up because i could not figure out how to make this work with my kindle fire . it could be me and not the app .
this game is a good time waster but its not worth a buck . i got it as the free app of the day but its definately a keeper
i like the graphics i find myself playing all the time ! my little one loves it as well as ny hubby .
i love playing solitaire and i do like this app.i usually play it once or twice daily depending on my schedule .
or was very slow and after i got a little way into the game it wanted me to buy the full version . i 'm deleting it off of my kindle fire .
i really have n't had a change to try it because i am always so busy with other thing so i will get to it to really give it a review .
this game and fruit ninja are far my favorite games . fruit slice is very interesting . i do enjoy playing it , more than fruit ninja ! ! ! !
a lot of glitches , but its absolutely adorable and still fun to play i think i like the addition of the animals !
this game was really fun but i had to delete it because of how addicted i got to it and when your on it that much it tends to make your kindle hot and stop running every now and then
i love this game . it is so scary i even had my mom watch me the first times i played this game . you have to get this app if you are a slender fan .
i love this bingo game ! i would recommend it to anyone who likes to play bingo . i just started playing , but i enjoy this game .
hints are reasonable and you can even have the answer solved . some movies are repeated answers . other than that , its a overall good game .
google is a great application is great for any search and its great my family like it and my kids can search anything they want thank you
the game is fun , though the lack of a zoom feature is annoying . but its a one play game . finished it in a few hours and kind of wish i could get a refund .
i find this to be a challenging game . makes you think . keeps my mind active . if you love word games i recommend this game .
love the ability to change the graphics on the tiles ! lot 's of variety of game patterns for you to choose from !
this is a great game . i really enjoy playing and also like that it was a free download . makes a great time waster : )
this game is awesome ! way better than 100 rooms . i enjoy the difficulty of the game but do not find it too challenging . wish it had more levels ! !
this game is really fun and addicting . i do n't have it on my kindle yet but i have played it .
i enjoy playing this game a lot but lately this game has been stopping a lot . i have n't played in two months because everytime i put it it stop . ; /
very nice game to play all throughout the day . i have a lot of time in between doing my daily chores and this is one way to pass the time .
great entertainment and fun for youngest children , so they will stick with this one for a while to learn or perhaps practice things they already know .
cool game once you get the hang of it ! can definitely get hooked , and use up some down time . try it ; )
far to much story and not enough game play . i was expecting more from this , extremely disappointed . deleted soon after download .
really not my kind of game that 's really all i have to say but apparently you require a certain amount of words .
the game is good mindless fun . it makes you realize how often you see logos and do n't connect them to a name .
this game is so addictive even my mom plays this game and i asked her one day if she liked it and she said that she does like coin dozer and i gave it four stars because of the advertisements
this game starts out really really basic but quickly gets you thinking of a solution to be able to move on to the next puzzle .
finally this game ! my dad has had it for a while and i beat him ! finally on kf ! any one who has a kindle fire and is sick of the old games this is a great choice
it is a good game , but needs a lot more levels . i was soon done with this one . it 's not deep enough to purchase however .
this app is so much fun . i ca n't stop playing it . very challenging . a must must must must must must have game . get it .
this is a great game that really keeps your attention . one of the best tower defense games over played so far .
now , i am pretty picky about apps , but this is great ! it 's like scrabble but free ! ! ! i play this every day ! ! !
i liked it when they came out with free style but still i think they need more designs its a disappointment i would n't waste my money on it if i were you
so far so good . i was hoping that all of the games were available at ones but overall it 's a good game .
i have a ball playing this game . i never played the & quot ; real & quot ; version with cards but this one is a blast .
this us a fun little game i would recommend it to others who like the other angry bird games to play
very challanging but it keeps the mind working . this is a great game i love puzzles and thing so this is right up my alley .
have not had the reason to use it yet . but , i assume it is as good as all the other products i get thru amazon .
if you love minecraft , you will love this ! it 's exactly like minecraft , just with 3d characters . ; 3 btw minecraft , y u have price ? d :
this is a great convenient app . it works great and its really simple . its a great app . i used it to wake myself up on christmas day . it has an alarm clock too .
enjoyed this app , , one of the better ive seen . wish it was longer , hope for a update soon . i would like to see the next levels , this is fun .
i love playing with my parents get this app as soon as possible i would recommend this app to all
great game . runs very smooth on my kindle fire hd . i have n't encountered a single issue since i downloaded this awesome game !
this is a fun game that is for all ages . i love this game because it is funny and a fast game to play
not working properly , get stuck and nothing happens when pressing on icons , i prefer to use the web to use this app , very bad , i do not recommend .
faster than turning pages . could not begin to carry everything that is in it . not easy to forget to have it with me .
i like that you can play in different languages , it 's great practice when you are trying to learn a second language . it really makes you think .
i like games like these . they 're a lot of fun to play with the family and of great quality as well
it was really good like the real one on ps3 and it was cool to kill zombies so cool but make it harder
my grandchildren and i have really enjoyed enjoyed . being able to upgrade your game piece is a nice touch . nice game .
this game is fun to play while waiting . the board is nice and easy to see . i get annoyed by the highlights but others may find them helpful .
this game had a good story line . the hidden object scenes were challenging -- though a little dark for my taste on a small tablet screen . but it was a good game and i enjoyed playing it .
i like the way this game gets progressively harder . but it would be nice if more combinations were available to play .
this game is great for my granddaughter it is easy and fun . she can play it in the car nothing else required .
this is great . not nearly enough puzzles but very enjoyable to play each . it was a good price so was well worth it for this mahjong .
nothing wrong with the game , just did not grab me for entertainment . played a few levels and then took of my device
i just goes slow , is my tablet or the app ? i do n't k n o w ! but it 's still nice other than that .
fun game to play . some of the other slot games you do n't get any bonuses , this one you do . received lots of free money too . have lots of fun wasting time with this game .
this game has a different twist on slots with bonuses and level ups . it 's fun to play and keeps you interested in what will come next
my son really likes the stories and will tell me all about them which i think is cute . it keeps his interest in it and will even sing along with it .
but be warned these puzzles are very addictive but good fun . they are very well presented and the graphics are good on my kindle fire .
just bought the full version of this game , love it . great challenge for my memory . fun trying to guess the movies .
i like this game also . i play solitaire a lot with cards so i enjoy playing it on the tablet .
i love word games and absolutely love this app . it relaxes me , makes me think , and passes the time away . it is addicting .
i have no clue what the full idea of this game is . it 's is still something new , and can be fun .
great app to have while your just relaxing anywhere . i love the sound of rain and nature sounds , this is very relaxing
i love these kind of games . this one is a little harder than some . especially if you do n't recognize the logos . just have to do some guessing yo figure some out .
i love this game ! ! ! it has a lot of quests to complete at each level to get you to the next level . it 's very interesting & actually fun .
crashed all the time i never got it to work and deleted after a few hours of trying it . do n't wast your time .
i really enjoyed this app . not only did it tell you the moon phase but it also allows you to view the moon phase a different days
would like a better partner and graphics are easy on the eye . play it everyday and have turned some friends on to it too .
good idea . but if you get stuck that 's it for the game . it need a pass button or something so you can continue paying . otherwise it 's fun .
now its over : ( but i really loved playing it for free it was great fun and very challenging as well
i enjoyed this game . well made and good graphic . i would suggest buying it . worth the money . geared toward older people .
fun game . very addictive , lots of games ads are annoying but the game is great . great time waster too . many games on app .
this game is da bomb ! ! ! ; - ) i love this game but it can get really boring after a long amount of time . ; - )
my child loves to play with this game . the game has several characters to choose from it 's really interactive and fun .
the game is fun , graphics nice , but when you get so far in , you 'll likely be told to wait for updates ... really annoying !
when you 're waiting for words with friends . you can spend hours playing . very happy that it 's free and fun to play .
i really enjoyed the game . only problem i found was i wished there were more levels took part . however the levels available were really fun .
this game is loads of fun , you get to use all kinds of strategies to kill the entire world . i love it .
no instructions horrible play tried for a 20 mind and still could n't get past the first level . would not pay a dime for this .
i like this game , more than most hidden object games . cool mini games and puzzles . not much story background which is refreshing .
tablet version is good and easy to use . it is one of the better versions that is available for electronic devices .
i downloaded this to my kindle fire ... and i use it everyday now . well worth the price . so i downloaded it .
love this game . it keeps your brain on edge and constantly thinking . highly recommended to pass the time and stay busy .
we bought the upgrade and it is her favorite game . little girl , likes to play dress up and loves this game !
i like the fact that it have videos . i 've never had a video bible . thank you for this nice app .
this game is fun . i like that you have unlimited chances to play . i have n't won yet but that 's okay . i 'm trying different strategies .
good mind challenging game i recommend this for older folks trying to keep their minds sharp and challenged i love it
i work to much and i 'm never home to watch my favorite shows . this is perfect for me ! you can even skip commercials !
love this game takes awhile to figure out am stuck but i will get it someday its great fun and time passer
i have only played this once ... i like it so far ... really works your brain .and i am sure it will help me with my other word games ...
my grandaughter ( 6 yrs . ) really enjoys playing this and likes to show her work off . has a lot of choices to pick from .
this is a great app . it is very easy to use . much easier than going to the website and using it .
so far a pretty good game . pretty good graphics and animation . looking at the amount of areas to e expand into could be awesome .
decent game but like others better . works fine on my kindle fire hd . just not as much fun as jewels .
if you enjoy playing slots , this is the app for you . the first slot machine has been in casinos for a long time .
i love this game for a bit more challenging game of solitaire , in my opinion you can never go wrong with solitaire
i hate it because it does n't turn properly and u cant turn . it any easier than tilting your device so fix it and you better
it just seemed like the same thing over and over again . ok , but i sure am glad it was free .
it is awesome i can play this all day no stop this game is so additive . i am so glad it is on my kindle if only . they had it for xbox or wii
it is a pretty good app and is usually right about about my mood ! i like using it a lot !
i really like this game and so do my children . it helps the time go by so fast . if you like bingo then try this one .
this game keeps you on your toes which is good for me and my coordination . fun to play and the grand kids love it . would recommend .
love these games . no time limit is nice when you just want to relax with a game but are still looking for a challenge . sometimes easy , sometimes difficult . but always fun .
bad piggies is a little slow for my taste but a good game , good way to pass the time when stuck in line
it 's getting so hard it 's not much fun to play . i play it now when i have nothing else to do
its an ok game but it does have the con side ! you only get so many colors to use and designs to use ! it also freezes a lot and its not that much fun after a while
i hate it when you get a free app and it is only part of the game . it should say sample .
up to date , easy to read and can check it any where any time . never like to be without the weather channel
this app works perfectly . i reccommend this app for anyone who loves to game . i play this game all the time .
one drawback , there is no storyline , just searching rooms for hidden objects . you can search a room over and over again , which can get boring ...
the original is not as fun as this one ! it is so much better than any other killing games and many more weapons !
the boy likes it but it 's another of those games you get to a certain point then you have to start paying for upgrades .
there really is nothing to do in this app . i am glad that it was free because i would of been upset if i would of had to pay for it .
as soon as i started playing this game , i was instantly hooked on it . fun , challenging and can be a great waste of time at your next doctors appointment .
looks fun . i have yet to play it , but the graphics look good , and the physics look real . looks fun
i like to get the information i need quickly and be on my way . when it comes to the local weather , this app is great .
this app is cool but i just updated it and it made it run very slow so dont buy this
this sounded like a great idea . but after searching for three songs and only getting lyrics for one of those songs i decided to uninstall . it is easier to search on internet and with better results .
i love this game so far it is lots of fun . i think it is a game i will play for a long time .
my 12 year old son wakes up on sat morning and reads for about an hour or so ! this is one of the reasons i got him a tablet !
this is a great game and very challenging . i like it helps you test your memory . math is a very important to do n't forget ever .
when i first started the app , all was well . then i tried to open the app again to check on my birds after a few hours , the app was stuck at loading screen ...
the game is so awesome . i like it better then words with friends . i also like that you get to earn coins and experience .
it 's so cool it 's really fun too like you can verse people and sometimes you might win or loose it does n't matter any way if i were you i rather get this app
this game is fun and you know if you rate you get a hundred coins and you really have to think if your going to play this game so i would get this because it 's fun
i 've only played about half of 1st level and already can feel my brain cells waking up ! not as easy as it looks !
i use fb on my kindle fire , my desktop computers and my phone . i like how the experience is the same across different platforms . solid app .
the buttons on the game is not fit for a tablet . it 's a a good game but better for pc .
fun game . i need better sound on my kindle fire , though . wish my fingers were smaller so that i would n't hit two keys at once !
i give this game 5 stars because its minecraft for hand held devices it is a very cool game
great game that has a lot of action . needs a lot of skill to play . fun game that is good to play whenever .
love this game . keeps your mind working & as we get older , this is something that everyone should be using to keep their brain fresh .
my brain is working hard on this one . great app . played with my grandson and we had a blast figuring out all the clues .
this is entertaining but i have played better , oh well it was free and i will keep playing thank you
this is soooooo crappy ! it did n't repeat a word i said ! do n't waste your time and space on this junk !
game gets 1 star from me because it wont load i would give it 0 stars if i could i hate games that waist my time downloading just to have it freeze on the loading screen
excellent game , very challenging to the mind and is entertaining to all age groups from age 10 to age 70 .
if you like lil kingdom and small street you will probably enjoy this one even more . these are my favorite types of games .
i just started the game . i think the game needs more features . it is entertaining . i ca n't complain since it was a free download .
this was not what i was looking for so i took it off my device . i had some trouble understanding how to navigate it at first but this was probably my problem .
there are only 3 games you can play without having to purchase more to unlock the others . wish it had more to offer .
i enjoy this game ... the graphics are great and it really uses brain power . my only complaint is its too hard to get coins .
i love this game . its so addicting . i play it all the time . its so much fun . i love it .
this a great way to stay updated on your favorite sports teams and all sports in general . i highly recomend it .
this game is an enjoyable app . i find myself to be addicted playing this game . the only problems . i see in the game are if you want to connect and join facebook .
too hard to control . to be honest , i 'm not very good at this game , therefore , i dislike it . so u can download it if you want to , maybe you 'll like it .
not enough challenges , points , or rewards . difficult to win and maintain points when playing the game . hard to achieve next level .
we love angry birds seasons ( my grandson and i ) . we take turns on each level to see who can get the highest score . we love the season 3 halloween version with the ghosts .
i love this game . my dad has it on his iphone , and whenever i play on it that 's one of the main games i play . this game rocks
this is a fun game . i know that when my grandchildren see it they are going to have fun with it as i enjoy playing it .
my 7 years old boy loves it ! it is nice and easy . we love it and recommend it . for every kid .
well you would have to buy the better version to get a password and stuff . so if you would even bother to get this app , get the paid version .
the game functions flawlessly , and the graphics are very good . the game does everything i want , and it is free . one ca n't ask for more ...
this game is so much fun , before you know it you 'll have played for an hour . i absolutely love love love this game ! ! ! ! ! ! !
this is alot of fun and really helps when no wifi available and you need something to help you pass the time .
this is the perfect game . of it 's kind this game gives you a way out if you do not know the answer . good for all ages
i love this app . the animals are super cute . it is super addicting and it gives you a whole world of fun right at your finger tips .
a little disappointed with this game . i really did expect a lot more , but it really fell short of my expectations .
i got this app for my son as he is learning to spell . it works great . very entertaining and the parent controls are cool . even my little girls are getting the hang of it .
this is a fun little arcade game . i wish there was a way to connect all the different little games so it would be easier to just jump back and forth between them .
love playing mahjong , for some reason this one just does n't do it for me . there are plenty of other options out there that are better .
the game was really not like the card game . the instruction were not clear . sure glad the game was free .
it 's tight i get to built my own gun o and add me to your friends awesomeness ya really easy to get free coins
i really like how it will flash when there is a number on either card . different from other bingo games
i love it ! it helps me to stay in touch with family [ especially those living out of state ] and friends .
it 's awesome and fun and maybe a little hard for some people in my opinion it is a go game and i wish there were more free games .
too many distraction ads on this . it 's probably fun but i did n't use it as much as others . not sure what else to say .
so fun and so addictive , this is one of the best apps i have had , great graphics , amazing sound effects and very addictive gameplay
not used to this type of game but it is fun so far . a little more info on what 's happening would be nice because i 'm not quite sure what i 'm doing .
great story , great controls , nice balance of puzzles and ho . would definitely get the sequel . only improvement would be to make puzzles a little more challenging .
i love this game it has great graphics and is very addicting . it 's like fruit ninja but with a way cooler twist on it . i cant wait for more areas to be added !
yep , i use it a lot and still installed but prefer more control to add items to remove or & # 34 ; kill & # 34 ; .
this is a game worth getting . the graphics are really spectacular . this is really addicting and a lot of fun .
this game is fun and good looking but gets very hard . i hate that you have to pay real money for all the upgrades .
i enjoyed this game . the colors are crisp , just like a winter day . the game is fun . i enjoyed the challenges . no major surprises to upset young players .
it 's an ok app . most of the logos they show are the same ones shown in the other logos app game . it 's free , though , so no complaints .
i like the size of the cards and the speed at which the game moves . i miss having a hint button , the only way to try different solutions is to undo moves , which can get tedious .
it is one of the best apps ive ever had but it took like freaking 5 minutes to download . other than that awesome app
my husband enjoyed playing solitaire so thought he might like this version . he enjoyed it on the tablet and would recommend it to others .
if your looking for a fun simple spades game . this is it . i play it on my kindle and htc evo phone .
i love all the comics , i have been able to purchase . they have change a lot of the ones i use to read . i look forward to find more favorites
this game keeps me occupied for hours . very addicting and easy to play . i recommend it to anyone who likes zoo games or city building games !
finally i can play my favorite game ever ! ! ! ! ! ! i am so happy i already beat 3 levels in one night and need help to board !
just making and popping bubbles , nothing to it . my son got bored quite fast and had to figure other things to do .
i really like this game . it makes you think and let 's you be creative at the same time great game should download it .
this is not the best or the worse app i personally have used before but it just was not my thing
it is very similar to flow free and it takes up time if your are bored and is very fun to play ! ! !
wish the trial version was longer . really gets you into it then it 's over . fun and requires you to be thinking
i have no problems with the game ( kindle fire ) . i like it when i want something to challenge myself . i recommend this game to everyone .
this game is a fun way to pass the time by and it 's great where ever you are even with friends or family . it 's a great challenge , which is what i look for in games .
it is over all in my opinion one the worst logo games out there . the only thing good about is it is free .
this is a great app for my children . they have fun with it . i would certainly recommend this app for any young child who loves star wars .
just right for the halloween season . i like it a lot . good selection of tones . lots and lots off un
is much like bejeweled but less expensive . would love to see a few more levels otherwise good game . happy gaming everyone !
fun . some icons are tiny on kindle , but very entertaining . i would recommend this game to anyone that likes hidden objects .
i have this app on my phone . love it cant put this game down if not playing on phone then on my kindle ! !
i have not figured out exactly how to play this . the matching of balls i like but not enough instructions at the beginning to suit me . i sure hope to learn more about this one .
this game takes online multiplayer games to the next level . it takes a while to learn the different aspects , but overall it runs smoothly and is extremely fun .
challenges your brain . some answers obvious , others not so much . i am using my hints too much . i have to give myself time to work it out .
the graphics are amazing . this is how people feel and imagine what they can to their bosses . great display . so addictive
love this game . brings back a lot of memories . completely forgot about some of this stuff . it 's a must have if you grew up in the 90s
best game ever ! ! get this game it is awesome ! ! ! ! just wish i could get all the animals & hellip ; but besides that i am perfectly happy with this game ! very addicting !
fun and challenging . worth the cost . i definitely recommend this game if you are looking for a casual game to relax and play . very enjoyable .
the games are ok. i like other games better but it does pass the time . it is free , so it is worth what i paid for it
not much fun.i just could n't get into it . it was a waste of space on my kindle fire . i deleted the game soon after downloading it .
fun and got the kids attention when a robot voice started talking to them . simple interface . could use a few more voice types .
great for all ages ! it is a game that can entertain many . we had so much fun playing this search !
this game is challenging and fun . it keeps you interested for hours . i recommend this game to young and old ad it is fun for all .

different games and challenging times . i loved these games and everyone is exciting . i really like it when you get stuck you can redo the tiles and keep on going ! !
i like the game a lot this game is so much better than paper toss and paper toss is very slow but office jerk is very fast

this game rocks its fun and amazing that my kindle fire hd can get this great of graphics without internet all the time .
i absolutely love this app . it is so realistic and very fun to do . i am so amazed how well the pics turn out . great job .
this is a great game to play all night long . the battles all tough some of the time , but not always ...
a very fun and challenging word association game . some were a little too easy but is good for all ages .
when i first loaded this game it worked fine . but lately it seems to be crashing just about every time i try to play . it is fun when it works .
this is just pictures of rooms ... .you can look through 5 or 6 pics , for different rooms in the house , to help get ideas on decorating . there is no designing anything yourself .
just like you watch on the tv would get this game again only draw back are the people wasting time
can mojang please add minecraft pocket edition ? i want it so bad . it 's just not fair that amazon is missing so many apps .
awsome game the stick figures really made me laugh ! ! great game and its free ! ! ! this game is good for all ages
it 's a puzzle game . it does have pretty pictures but it 's not what i thought it would be at all .
that is all i can really say about it . it 's not amazing but it does n't suck either . it 's nice to pass time with .
this game is sooo addicting ! love that it is a fast and easy game . get your friends together and have a fun time .
with my job i need all the help i can get to on time . this app does a fine job of that ! very nice .
this is a great game . i just can not pull myself away from it , i am hooked . hope you will get further updates . 5 stars .
this app was a bigger pain than it was worth . i had more trouble with my phone after i installed it and the trouble ended when i removed it .
i love it ca n't wait to use it on my new kindle great value and i 'm excited happy happy joy joy ! ! ! !
dumb ways to die is an epic game ! i love how you can watch the music video once you unlock enough points . now the song is stuck in my head . whoever invented this game is genius .
fun and challenging to try to decide what all four pictures have in common . a joy to play with the whole family .
it was not free yesterday when i got it but even though it was not free when i got it so worth it i love the game
it was entertaining i enjoy playing it the levels were quite nice . love playing this game one rainy afternoon . quite enjoyable
the game is interesting in itself and works like most other games of its type . earning enough cash flow to finish tasks takes a lot of time and patience .
i got this app for my children because all of their friends play this game . they love it . i find them playing the game whenever they can . it certainly keeps their interest .
this app does not work as it is described . it needs updated or something . maybe it just does n't work on my android .
i love this game . it 's a good thing real money is n't involved or i would be in big trouble . lots of fun .
i went searching for a different mahjong game . i think you 'll like this one . it 's quick & amp ; easy . you 'll be able to share this one with young kids , too .
i like this little flip but i really do n't use it . it is fun to use and holds many words .
if your a fan then they got it right . great interactive features and an overall good experience . i highly recommend .
the app was fine , the cost of the service you need to sign up to use it , is too costly .
i 've always enjoyed zuma games and this is a very fun one to have on my kindle . i would strongly recommend this version .
no bugs . no crashes . it is just such a fun and amazing game to play and one of the best parts is that it 's free !
best game ever if u have n't played u need to get it and it 's free and if u like to drive this is your game .
i do not enjoy this game . i find it pointless and frustrating . no real fun to it at all for me .
just started this game and love it . easy to use and gives you hours of play time with extra bonus that i like
can only enter 1 room then you have to pay for any others you would like to enter . good luck
i really enjoyed this game . and an added extra is that it was free of charge . i would definately recommend this app to anyone who likes solitaire games .
this app is stupid i cant even play my own songs when i try and you only have like 3 choices its stupid but their are better games and i know . im not happy with the app
why is it there are no directions for any of these games ? we found this game had very little for the child to do .
a great game , ca n't believe that it is free . my kids love it . i 'm also addicted to it and it helps pass the time . great job !
would have more ways to count the calories and more ways of exercise but mostly good , there was very few working exercises
this game is awesome i liv it anyone who is anyone should try it so if ur human you need this game
its ok. a skip button would be nice and the clips could be a few seconds longer . overall , a decent way to pass the time .
it is wonderful i love it u should download it it is awesome . just like the computer version so ya ... .
this is a great brain teaser . lots of fun and very addictive . sometimes i ca n't put it down . great fun ! ! ! ! !
i like this game . it is fun to play alone or with a friend . the colors are bright and easy to look at . if you like word games this is good .
i love this wallpaper because there are so many . you can keep changing daily and still have some left . they are sooooo cute !
i use a kindle and i have had no problems . even logging in through facebook or otherwise . i love it , great game for almost all ages . as long as you know how to doodle .
great for kids . my daughter loves this app ! ! ca n't get her off of it ! it 's perfect for children and its free !
i would rather play by myself . i do n't like games where i have to contact other people on the internet .
this game is awesome i think everyone would get it it is cool to it can be tricky and fun at the same time .
i have found so many great ideas , beautiful places and fun things ! i always have a good time being on this site .
love hidden object games , this ones fun . get yours and enjoy . graphics are great and the story line is pretty good too .
i could never get this thing to work properly and because of that , i ended up deleting it without being able to use it even once .
great game . puzzles are no too challenging but graphics were great . definitely better quality and more entertaining than lots of the games out there . loved the storyline . highly recommend
this game is just ok. i did n't feel it worked as good as it should . sometimes it was hard to see items .
the reason , people it goes so quick , is because its a challenge . the purpose is to test your sight abilities and increase your reflexes .
i love the channel and love this app . awesome app . it keeps you up to date and very informative . love it .
this is one of the best mahjong style games around . plenty of layouts , tile sets and backgrounds to make it feel like a new game each and every time.i highly recommend this app to everyone .
i give this game a 5 stars , love playing with friends ... .so who ever has doubt , just try it for yourself ... . awesome game ! ! ! !
if you love numbers , this puzzle game is a great break from regular sudoku ! great stress relief for me ! if you do n't enjoy figuring simple numbers , you probably wo n't love this game !
i like this game wish there was more like it . a little too easy ! went threw it very fast over and over again .
original game so its a good game but the newer versions are amazing and more fun and interesting plus i like that you can hit more than pigs to get points
use it on my samsung galaxy note all the time . display is effective and has all functionality as online banking website .
dumb ways to die is a great game , but the worst part is that there are a lot of adds and the video is really funny you should get this game
another one for the grandson . he enjoys playing games and i really do not understand some of them but as long as he has fun that is the main thing .
i downloaded this on the fourth of july . wow ! it even has quiet sound effects . i got a real kick out of this and passed it around the living room for my family to play .
enjoying solving the puzzles and hidden object screens . great graphics ! my one complaint would be the price of the full app . free app only lets you do part of the story . kind of expensive .
this game is awesome but extremely difficult because you have to go through the pipes perfectly . if you do n't then you die .
very entertaining . keeps your mind working to figure out the words . does not cost too many coins when you need a hint .
it seems so easy at first but as the levels increase it gets quite difficult . it is not boring or repetitious . it is possible to play without purchasing anything . it definitely helps pass the time .
i chose this rating for this game because i enjoy taking the shapes to make a picture . i would recommend this game to others .
i love any kind of game that makes me work to win . love the graphics and recommend this game to everyone .
interesting and fun . sometimes very easy then you might get one that is really frustrating . i had one that i knew but could n't come up with . ended up looking for the name on the web .
i have a similar game that i play more because scrabble sometimes freezes up on my kindle . i have n't tried playing it with someone yet , so hopefully i will like it better after that .
i do n't like it because it was not loading the show and it was a waste of time . that is why i do n't like it
i need to be able to quickly convert money on my upcoming trip and it will be very handy to have it on my phone
i like the themes and puzzles the interruptions during your game which is timed is extremely annoying i think it 's a 2 1/2 star but ca n't put in the 1/2
this is a really good app . it allows u to watch your shows on the go and best of all its free .
this is a well made game . it is a lot of fun , relaxing , challenging , and beautiful . i 'm really glad they keep making more of these games .
i have several of your hidden mystery games , and i really like them , but after a while they become to obvious , and are not a challenge .
this game is fun . it keeps you entertained all the time , i love the new levels created for the seasons , ca n't wait for the next season ,
really only did it when i could not sleep at night , so when it was the last possible thing left .
my husband is constantly complaining about this app , according to him it is a waste of time unless they improve it .
this is a cute game but hard . my 2 kids love it too . i really love this game its better then the old ones . please make more levels ! so awesome ! best game ever .
a fun little game , a bit confusing in places , but a very enjoyable game almost any age can enjoy and graphics are great .
awesome , addicting game , easy to learn and build your strength . my son loves it , plays it daily beautiful done game
i like this game , it 's like tetris with numbers . it gives me a good mental workout and is a great way to pass a little time while waiting at the doctor 's office .
its so fun i like it but it also sucks cause u dont get much energy so u cant it that long but like like i said it is a amazing game and i really do suggest it
i watch disney channel . they have an ad for this game that says you can download it free from the app store . personally i think you should just get the regular free temple run until this is free
love this game the best game i got on my kindle fire since i got my kindle cant stop playing this game
i am really going to enjoy this i love being able to listen to the bible and read along . thanks
makes you think not the best game i 've played but it is a thinking game . i would recommend it to adults
a good way to pass the time with several board designs to choose from . i would recommend this to a friend
we have . a lot of fun playing this game . it brings us together . so for a few hour 's a day we laugh make fun of are answers .
i like puzzles and hidden object games . this got good reviews , so i tried it . glad i did . hope more rooms get added soon .
i like the application and it seems to be working very well , i will give this app a complete work out in a few days just to be sure .
works great on my kindle fire . nothing spectacular , but the graphics are good , the game gets more & amp ; more challenging as you go .
game moves very slowly , but i guess it just takes time . i 've been playing for 3 days . have n't seen much change .
my granddaughter downloaded this game because she loves to draw and create cool pictures . she likes it , but gets bored of it after a short time .
this a great card game . it is a great way to pass the time . plus it is fun to play and collect the cards within the game .
i recommend this delightful game . and if i were to give this a rating i would give them four stars i hope this game brings you pleasure and joy
really nice game . can win and not pay but frequently gets laggy . every time i 've played its happened . otherwise great game
this game is so so so so so so so fun . i think you will love it buy it please . my cousins always play it . the best part is that its free .
my son plays this all the time . he knows his shapes pretty well and he loves having to & # 34 ; find & # 34 ; the different shapes and different colors . i totally recommend this .
this is the greatest alarm app i have had the opportunity to experience and i am glad i chose it .
this game is really fun except there is no way to earn gems unless you buy them and a lot of things they want you to use gems on .
it was not a bad game . it was a little boring and hard for my 4 yr old . it was n't exciting enough .
fun app ! each level gets a tiny bit more difficult . really enjoy playing & trying to figure out the steps for each game !
i love this app , the only downside is you have to wait 30 minutes for one life , or ask your facebook friends . if you do n't have a facebook account , then play at your own boredom
its a good app the only problem is once you make a alarm all you can do is not have it go off
this game is a lot of fun . the graphics are nice . it has pretty good replay value . try it you 'll enjoy it too .
so cool i play it all the time i play it so much that i 've beat adventure like 14 times lol ! ! so if you want to get addicted get it ! ! ! ! !
i enjoy this app game to test my knowledge of the bible . it has many good and interesting questions . highly recommended
i was disappointed . there was no tutorial and i was n't sure how it worked . i would not recommend this version of this game .
love this ! very fun and addictive . the best part is not really having to spend money to get the full experience . worth my time !
my son loves this game . he is 11 and this show is what helped me to interest him in god . i only wish there were more free .
i love the game so it got a 5 star but we need that update that has been out for over a month this is ridiculous
i 'm either getting too good at this or the games are getting too simple . but i ca n't stop playing the damn thing !
i like this app as it contains information on all the major sports . it has scores , it keeps up with stats and gets the latest news to you in sports as they happen .
we needed it to read certain books . i think it should of came with the kindle fire for what we paid for the item
it is a puzzle i like doing . glad to find it for kindle . now i can play or read on the same device .
my daughter loves this app and it is very easy for her to navigate . it makes learning fun for her .
the controls are quite awkward and made the game frustrating . i deleted the game after ten minutes . do n't bother with it .
i enjoy this , it works well , you can chose the colors with each entry , it helps me stay a little more organized .
downloaded this game for my kid . i thought it looked incredibly stupid but after i tried it , i could n't put it down . it 's actually way more fun and challenging than it appears .
this app does not have enough games it really starts to get boring . would be a good app if they added more like what they have online .
highly addictive and challenging game . the graphics are adorable . i love the music and the story . i ca n't wait for more levels to come !
i think this is a great app in all . it looks great and makes a good screen saver . though it is expensive , i think it is worth the money
this is a fun game . easy to play and just as good as the one you find on your pc . i love it on the fire
do not buy this , it is a waste of time and a waste of money . this is n't even worth getting for free .
i use this app ( on my kindle fire ) constantly when i 'm working in the kitchen . after i set the timer , i play a game of read ... . best of both worlds .
very cool app.i love this app i can play so many games and i love that its challenging and very addicting
it is ok easy to play . not as good as bingo blitz . but works fine . easy to loose and can play with kindle fire .
so far so good with this game . you really have to think about what to do next . it seems confusing at first but hopefully it gets better .
i just downloaded pop the pic . and so far i love the game and so does my two year old does too
my daughter enjoyed the animals and their sounds . she had lots of fun but i do n't recommend it for older children
i ca n't figure out what 's happening to to game it wont let me play other than that it 's alright the game doesnt make much sense but hey its free
my daughter enjoys using this . she is 2 , and was able to learn it rather quickly . she does have trouble changing back and forth between colors , but enjoys it .
the touch feature was easy to use for my 2 year old grandson . graphics and sound effects were very good and held his attention .
i like it it helps me pass time when bored i also think it a very cute game my daughter really enjoys the game as well
great game fun for passing time i recommend this game to anyone ... ... . definitely get this game its worth it ! ! thanks glue mobile
fun i am enjoying playing this game and find it to be very challenging as i get further into the game .
this is what i like to do when i am relaxing or on a long ride . it 's always good to challenge your mind .
this game is the best and it lets you get free everything and if you rate it get free gifts
a good little risk clone . the interface is easy enough , and the game overall is responsive and fun . worth your time .
i saw the movie and loved it so i gave the game a try . i love it ! never going to uninstall
my grand s on loves this again you have to use both hands to play . : have fun and good luck get the high score .
my daughter likes this game . but unless you are willing to spend money to upgrade it is very limited . but good for keeping kids entertained at doctors office .
the game gets a pretty dull after awhile . i 'm over boring scrolling games . pass on this application if your looking for a good time waster while waiting for appointments .
the game is like no other it has more features , objectives , and much more . it is challenging and should be tried out at least .
i love how you can move the whole line up and down to line the creatures up and even if you do n't line it up perfectly it still pops
i now have it running on everyone of my devices . bad thing is they do n't sync together i wish they would
i would have given it a 5 star rating , except it freezes up about 1 out of every 3 battles . but it is fun and entertaining even with this minor glitch .
this game needs some definite upgrades . the game reminds me of some of the atari game s of yesterday . too bad .
this app is terrible . it is just puzzles . just puzzles , and not a decent amount either . 4 puzzles . do not get it
would be nice if you could skip and if you did n't have to have all in one level to move on to the next .
wish there was more to the bonus , but maybe it will get better as the levels increase . decent so far .
it is so fun because you can make rides you collect coins people come to see and tips are save gold get water and lovely food .
i think that it is kinds cool that is like cute the rope but they could have made it even better so it did n't look like cut the rope ... ; )
this game is way better than other games like this . i 'd say this game comes out at the top . i suggest getting it .
i am very disappointed with the game . i wish there was more instruction as i seem unable to figure it out and frustrated .
i like this it really makes you think and i do get stumped . i think it might be too hard for younger children . my husband enjoys this also
this is as much fun as the original . just hard enough to make you think but not so hard that you get frustrated with it .
i give this app a 5 star because it does exactly what i wanted it for . so there ya go .
enjoyed it . bummer the free version was so short . do n't think i 'll pay $ 2.99 to continue though . it seems too much for this game .
it took forever to download . i had to delete it because my kindle locked up when i would try to play it .
great fun game but lots of ads but they make sense for a game being free . download this app , it is amazing !
this is a fun & amp ; different word game . the last update added 60 more levels . once you get the hang of it , you 'll be hooked .
it alright puzzle are easier to put together since they are only about 30 pieces . it something fun to do if bored or have spare time
though it is taking me some time to learn , it is fun learning how to play . once i learn more i will play more .
this is a fun game . wonderful app to have . lots of fun and it is very different from the other apps on my phone . absolutely love it
just started playing this and its fun but some puzzles are quite hard . i wish there was a skip button instead of being stuck for hours
i love this game and would recommend to anyone who likes this type of game , i can spend hours playing this game .
i 'm a 14 years old and this is my favorite game on my kindle . i recommend this for anyone ... ... . it is fun to mix and match all the outfits
this is my go to game to have fun and relax . more fun and changing than regular solitary . i play this game the most of all the games i have .
the hardest fast past most amazing game in the world i would recommend this game to very one it 's awesome .
it 's ok , but just a picture of where i am . i probably could make it useful , but do n't use it much .
if you have to go on twitter get it . but it is still in the new stage . very confusing ! .
granddaughter loves this game . she is 4 and counts the hidden eggs and really enjoys the puzzles . would recommend this game for young children .
this game is really good it makes you think and also try to figure out . just what they have in common to get the word .
i love this app you can rank up and have your own farm and meet new people i recommend this game
do n't waste your time on this app.it is fun but it made me start all over ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! this app deserves 1 star .
the great thing about this app is that it helps you waste time when you have nothing else to do ( you can draw some pretty stuff sometimes too ! )
it 's the first time i have ever played any type of game on line , i really like it and i now prefer to play on line than against the computer .
just downloaded it ! my son already loves it ! great graphics too ! now i have to fight to get my kindle back from him !
i love this game its a lots of fun but very addictive i now have my whole family playing this game .
just got it because it was a free month , i would n't order it again , i ca n't read and listen at the same time .
i love this game . it is terribly addicting . the colors and graphics are great . now i see what all the fuss is about .
i play this a great deal . the game is quick and when playing against the computer is competitive . very nice .
nice game for the holiday . starts pretty easy and gets harder . like the fact that there 's different difficulty levels . if u like fruit drops you will love this game !
this game is great and really keeps you interested in the plot . great if your a fan of tap zoo or tiny village . try it..
this game is really challenging and fun ! you have to think about it to solve the puzzles but it is so much fun to save the little drop people . highly entertaining !
i hate this game everytime i threw the ball it went inside the hole do not download this game ok ! ! ! !
not what i thought it was going to be . play it every once n a while , a little too young for me .
some of the games are pretty easy , but as you get farther along , they get challenging . great to play any time .
its a very fun game just be warned i would n't recommend to ten or younger haha no joke but i still love this game ! ! ! !
was n't . sure about my choice at first but turns out its lots of fun . can be addicting at times , lol but lots of fun
sorry you game lovers ... i did n't like it ... i mean not enough to buy it . i 'm not really sure why i really did n't like the game .
love word games and this is a great one . just hard enough to keep me thinking but not so hard that i get frustrated .
i love this game ! also , if you running low on coins and it 's late at night , go to sleep and wake up with so many coins .
nice ap , easy to use . i personally do n't use it very often , but my wife loves it , seems easy enough .
this is n't skype compatible , and if i recall correctly , it was n't compatible with many of the most popular im programs .
easy game to play . you level up pretty fast . i have not found any issues so far . great game to kill time with .
you do n't get to do anything really . all you do is dress her up . it 's so boring . nothing to do .
enjoyed the game and graphics but like most of the g5 games it is too short for the price . only bought it cause i love these types of games there are cheaper ones with more levels .
initially i enjoyed this game , but now i find it boring . with another version , i occasionally had success . any suggestions ?
i was only able to do 3 puzzles and it freezes . not worth the time to try and download this puzzle .
quite a fun app . always looking for answers while driving or reading advertisements in magazines . i highly recommend this app !
i enjoyed this game . addictive until you are able to beat it . fun way to pass the time away . would recommend .
i 've loved pac-man since i was a kid . i really like this game , but it 's really hard to maneuver pac-man around the maze .
fun , but a little slower than other bingo games of this type . still fun , just wish you could get more plays .
personally , i love this game ! yes you have to download it and it takes up some space but on the kindle fire its not bad at all ! love it !
this is easy to see and use . it has all the basic features i need in my life , since i do n't need complicated math .
this game is pretty cool , it 's free to play but you have to pay for the extras . i 've found that i do n't really need anything extra though .
this is awesome fun to play plenty of characters to collect . i started playing not having the console game but now i want it .
it is a fun game . you can feed your horse and play with it too . i suggest this game to animal lovers or if your mom wo n't get you a pony for christmas . lol : p
i am going to try to continue to play it but i ca n't get around in it . it is a little bit hard to learn how to use .
i did not care for this game . it was too short and not very interesting . might be suitable for a younger person .
this game is fun . surprisingly easy and hard at the same . sounds are not annoying . colors are pleasing . fun for all ages
i do play this game . i do n't play this one too much . i do like it because i can play on my kindle .
wish that i could make it bigger though makes you think about your next move ! fun fun fun fun fun
i 'm a girl and i like this app my step brother had it on his kindle so i decided to get it
love this app , lots of things to look at . like looking for interesting videos . great variety and fun looking at all the different types of videos on there
i like this app so much because i can scanner all my documents and save this in my kindle . i share this information with my friends in an easy way .
easy enough for anyone to play . you can also adjust levels on all games to better suit your skill level . simple and beautiful layout . would recommend for all who want to exercise their brain .
really amazing game and amazing graphic kind of slow sometimes not always . i would recommend this game to many others
wow . this game is fun it cost 0.99 on the first day ... but still pricey but fun get this app
enjoying it immensely ! very challenging ... hope it continues ! have n't quite figured it out yet , but that is what makes it so interesting ! ! !
not one of my faces . you should try it for yourself you may or my not like the game . i just was not impressed with it .
wow this game is so fun . there 's 101 games in 1 game and there so addicting . i think you should get this game .
this game is fun . you get to create anything you want . makes it kind of exciting to do . never know what the limited edition items are .
this game is good ! i like that there are no hidden objects and the puzzles are not ridiculously hard ! it has kept me entertained for hours and what a great price ! !
this app is really good . i suggest getting this app because it 's lot like minecraft pe . also it 's free ! so have fun playing guys !
this app is really good there is a decent variety of sounds to help me relax and fall asleep . it also seems to help keep me asleep .
it was a challenge at first but then things began to fall into place and i have got great enjoyment from the game since then .
this game is way too addicting especially if you like to get three stars on every level . get this game it a good challenge and you wo n't get bored .
i hope to see more updates improvements .i enjoy this game it 's fun and exciting and new to me as well the board game with the dice is a must .i give this application a five stars rate
i did n't like this product . i deleted it immediately . it was not a fun game to play . it confused me and bored me .
please fix this i loved it and i always played it but now i cant beacause its to choppy you can never do anything when it is that choppy so please fix it
my granddaughters really love playing this game a lot . i would recommend this game to all children .
good game it is the best game i ever played buy the app it is the best play the game
if you 've played angry birds before , what can i say that you do n't already know ? there just are n't enough levels , but then , what 's enough ?
i have played so many good games in my life but this takes the cake . you shoot , wins , and kill , the things on want in a game . this game will not disappoint you !
i 've added several words to my vocabulary playing this game . i thought it might be too easy , but i was pleasantly surprised .
just wanted something to keep tablet safe , so far it seems to provide all the security that is needed to keep my tablet safe .
with this app it makes it a very fast way to look up things you might want to get so you can shop faster . : )
my 4 and 8 year old really enjoyed this app , , it got a little hard for my 4 year old but my 8 year had no problem and really liked it
again could not download because of the size of tablet i have , otherwise i think it would have been fine
it was fun and all for a while but this is just one of those games that gets very boring after awhile
i really like this game but it is a slow pace game . it needs more options and stuff to do .
i love this game ! wish i could play it on my iphone though . it 's almost as good as words with friends .
great game and nice graphics . great way to relax and have fun . would like more games like this . hope they do a second one .
the fireworks are really nice . just wish they would tell you how many rounds to game . it is fun anyway .
since i have downloaded it , i ca n't stop playing , works very well on kindle fire hd , graphics and sounds are very well put together .
just started the game can not give a honest opinion trying to get past the people . it looks to be a great game so far .
this is an excellent application i love the fact that i can watch any show that i 've missed or find new ones to watch
easy to use and fun to play . love the way the colors are bright . wish there was more than just one game for 2 minutes .
maybe a good app , however unable to install on my phone . have it 3 stars for dev benefit . maybe suitable for higher end devices .
this is a good app do n't get me wrong its bad but if they made better free upgraded ones this one would not get many reviews and people to use it
enjoyed playing this game . very easy interface takes some thinking though to clear the board , but a great app to purchase
my kids love playing this game . i catch myself sometimes playing it to try to help the kids get to the next level .
feed the fish , watch them grow then sell them . what else can i say ? is not freezing up , loads fine , a decent time killer while waiting .
some pictures are easy and others make you think outside the & # 34 ; box & # 34 ; . fun way to pass the time and keep your mind active .
this game is a great game to play especially when you are wanting to have fun and be a kid again
lots of fun for kids ! also this is a great value since they put basically 2 games in one . recommended !
did not really enjoy this game . i did not want to waste storage on my kindle fire for this . much better game out there .
very cute and easy to learn how to use . some of the words are to big for me to understand but love this app .
i do n't understand the need for this . android already has this functionality built in . just hit menu and & quot ; save for offline reading & quot ; .
this is the typical solitaire game , not much to say about it only that i love solitaire and i like this game .
this game keeps my grandkids busy . they beg to play it on my kindle fire whenever i visit them . i 've watched , and it really does seem fun .
it 's a very special and challenging game . it keeps you thinking , because some of them are so easy you know them when you see them , but some can be a challenge ! ! ! !
it 's fun but i got bored after awhile . i play to pass time . it could be a bit more challenging .
this plays just like the one on my computer and actually is my new morning addiction waiting to get to work . love it ! and so does the rest of my family .
my 3 year old grandson likes this . i think it 's a hair advanced for him but he enjoys it . creative and teaches early thinking skills .
fast . good graphics . simple . not limited by energy . does n't require you to buy extra stuff . highly recomend . cute characters . love it
this game is fun but not as fun as the other 4 words 1 picture but is still a fun game
big fish never lets me down with their games . the graphics are so good . this is a relaxing , just chill ' n type of a game .
this is a great game i love this game so so much its better than cake maker original i think that u should get this app
it 's a very fun game for children as well as for adults . if you love animals this game is for you .
this app works well on kindle fire . plenty of & quot ; wild card & quot ; tiles . very easy so far . no complaints from me .
nice puzzles . it can really make you think at times so good for your mind . good way to past the time when you have time to spare .
i like that they move fast . the characters r very nicely drawn . it 's not hard to get the hang of it . cool game !
this game is very addictive . cant seem to put it down . love it so much . i share this game with my kids .
this game is addicting ... i love playing it ! ! i lose track of time when i start to play . it is one of the best games that i have played in a while .
says it 's free , and it is . but you ca n't access the content unless you already subscribe to stars . not worth your time unless you already subscribe .
i thought this was an incredibly boring game . i have already deleted it from my kindle -- ugh !
this puzzle was not what i expected . i found no instructions to help me to understand it . thus , i do n't waste my time on it .
have n't played it much . downloaded because it was free . tried it for a little while . while not bad , did n't keep my interest .
i like this version of the game and enjoy playing it . much of it is like the television game we all know and love so there was no learning curve and you can just start right in .
i use this app for any notes i get or any stories i write . it has been a very good help to me . a must buy .
this is a fun logic problem . i 've only started playing with it , but i can see that it will be a challenge . there are lots of different puzzles , although some look very similar .
i really enjoyed this game . good story line and the ho were n't so bad . cant wait for the second one . way to go ! ! !
had a difficult time figuring out how to play this game . we play the regular card game all the time , but this was not what i expected .
if you do n't look at the pics , how will you know if it uses facebook or not ? i would give it five stars but people ruined it . ruined it ! ! !
i would rank it 5 once they iron out the bugs . other than that , great graphics , good audio , simple gameplay could n't ask for more !
like most games in this fashion it took some getting used to . feels like angry birds meets cut the rope .
past the first chapter you have to pay to continue . faotd fail , would be a 4 star review without this annoying little fact .
this one is addictive . always trying to beat the evil one . makes you want to keep playing . the animation is nice and makes the game more interactive .
love this game it is so cute and so so fun it is good to send people you know a little card so so cute
wow ! i am getting nothing done because of this game ! ! i wish there were a few more types of levels but all in all , this game is quite fun !
way too easy compared to the other door games but worth the free download if u feel like winning a lot
enjoyed the game . was worth the money & amp ; graphics were good . my only complaint would be that when i needed to use a hint the hint button was small and hard to tap .
you will love this game . for all age 's . someone told me about the this game , said i would like it , they were right .
have n't been able to download the game . i have tried several times to download it . i ca n't get it to download on my tablet .
this game is simple but it is hard to jump over slender girl and it takes a lot of time to upgrade
this game is the worst game ever ! it looked fun but its not ! do n't get this app ! take my word for it .
great for learning and fun and good for little kids this app is great and its free and fun i think it is awesome for the young
actually got this for my 6 yr. grandson when he spent the night and was bored . he loved it would recommend .
okay app . not that many locations , at least in the areas i was interested in . i hope they 're planning to keep adding options .
not a bad game , makes you think a bit on some puzzles . nice way to keep your mind sharp during breaks .
this app helps me draw guns because i 've never been able to draw anything like this . so i would recommend this app if i were you .
this game is absolutely addicting . its really hard for me to put it down . would be even better if it had more puzzles but every game has its ending .
best game ever truly a good game good for kids and the family its fun its cute you got ta love it .
cool game not as easy as i thought it would be . some levels took a lot of effort to find the objects . nice surprise
not a custom app for amazon . been out for a while in the android market . personally i like the game . one of the few that does n't force close .
this is a good app and just saying if you want more free apps , get them at google play ... so this is pretty cool get the app
love the way it repeats anything you say in whatever tone you use . and kids love it . would recommend for all .
not at all impressed with it . love the other games but just did n't like it . there are n't enough steps . would not consider buying it .
only deal with this is after so many games they want you to buy it and if you do n't then you ca n't play it any more
oh , i love playing this game.it helps pass the time and it 's fun , and yes , i would recommend this game
some are easy some are hard but it doesnt progress as you go through the levels nice for a free game
the game is pretty fun . lots of variety in games which is fun . it can take a while to unlock all the games though which is a fun challenge
it is ok but lots of people dont know lots of the logos ! ! blah blah blah blah blah blah etc .
its a very fun and entertaining game . it works very well on my kindle fire and i recommend it to anyone who enjoys dress up games .
fun version of freecell ... works fine on the kindle fire , plays similar to the windows version . if you like freecell you should give this a try .
this game is so much fun for adults and kids and the music and graphics are adorable and it is just down right fun to play
my cousin played this game on her phone so i thought i would try it out and i love it ! its fun and super addicting !
i love this game so much it is not funny at first i thought the game was going to be lame but i was wrong you should by this app
i like this game ! it is very fun to play and is a game for all ages . just a fun game !
i like all of the facebook applications at least i can go and see what is going on or is someone has sent me a message and i can see what is going on .
another game that grabs you and will not let you go till it is through with you ! i like that you can take a guess or turn over another pic for another clue . it 's great .
this game it horrible ! ! ! ! ! there 's not a lot of choices and it 's touchy . i would give it 0 stars if i could .
it was a really awesome game . it a puzzle and adventure game . it was fun and a long game to play that the best game i play
like the ability to & # 34 ; buy help & # 34 ; with the freebie coins , and scramble the letters so you can form more words .
i liked playing it for a while , but to really enjoy the game you have to buy all this extra stuff ... that kind of kills it for me
the game it self was fun but you half to buy each season at 5 dollars a pop . i got through the first season in 30 minutes
other people may like this . i just didnt care for it . it was a hard game and you dont have enough time to see if you change your mind . i wouldnt buy it .
i love this game its safe enough i can let my daughter help me play plus i can enjoy watching the tv show and play the game
not fun at all for a free game . you do n't even get 5 minutes of play and they want you to buy coins .
it 's free but it 's not a good game . do n't get it . the only thing good about it is that it 's free .
it 's from ea so you know it 's going to be bad before you even launch the damn thing but you do it anyway .
okay so the main reason i am rating this app is because i will unlock more drawings ... but i promise you this app is great !
this game is so much fun . some of the puzzles are really hard , but others seem so easy . makes you think .
this is a good game for both kids and adults who feel like kids . if you enjoy the other running games then you will probably enjoy this one too .
i like the idea of picture puzzles . it makes me think a bit differently than other games . keep them coming .
one of my favorite games ! very challenging and a must for those who love word games ! works the brain really well !
i love it . if your a horse lover you will love this game . that is why i rate this game 5 stars .
it 's a really good game for people who like fun challenging games . its challenging but not too hard and very rewarding ! i think you 'll love this game ! ! !
said it would speed up my tablet , it speeds up my tablet . i also like the way it only takes a few moments . would recommend for the price alone .
oh my god this game is absolutely fun and very affordable actually it 's free this is like the game logo quiz but just a tab better
my grandson seemed to like it while visiting over the weekend . i will leave it on my kindle for his use .
this game is pretty fun it could be better but it 's still a good game i like it it 's super addicting
this game is probably the best game i have ever played on my tablet . from looking at the cover i did n't really pull me in , but do n't judge a book by its cover .
this works well on my kindle . it does not give you all the functions that i have from my laptop , but lets me check my facebook , post messages and other .
i chose this rating because it 's an excellent and challenging game ! ! i takes lots of skills to learn and beat everything ! !
i do n't use this app , so i can not properly rate it . so i 'm going to give it three stars and leave it at that .
i could not find anything interesting on this app 's menu . not much selection and what was there was not what i would read .
christmas drop is a good game when you simply want to relax and not think . i enjoyed the lovely music .
this is a good game i like how the background goes with each season but you have to buy certain birds with real money
love this . so easy to navigate , the variety of functions this app has makes it appealing to a wide range of people .
pretty fun app . its a good time waster . but it takes a lot of playing to build up enough points to open more games if you do n't want to buy points .
this app is cool so many cool games in 1 app . my son loves them too . keeps my son busy for hours .
this game rocks . it 's fast paced and has good graphics . i cant stop playing it . cant wait to see what 's next .
i got this just so i could get books recommended to me based on what i have read . there were no books recommended . i uninstalled it almost immediately
it is so easy to see and use . the calculator has large numbers so that it is easier to use for those who have problems using a regular size .
this is the most boring game i have played yet . i kept waiting for the game to start then i realized this is the game . do n't waste your money like i did .
this app works great ! i was able to communicate with my daughter when she was in a spot with no cell service . love it .
just started play pretty fun i guess i hope this helps very very good game for kids and adults bye
i must admit that i usually hate disney 's app games but nemo has been pretty good . my daughter loves it and so do i .
does not give you the answers once your time is up , text twist is a better version of this type of game .
maybe i will like this better if i can figure it out . i need a lot more instruction so i can enjoy it .
i really like this game ... . i just wish i had the entire game instead of only half of it . i love it and i would recommend it to anyone .
this app was not a fit for what i needed it for . there are better apps for the same price on amazon . just find the fit for you .
i like the games a lot at the classic level . however it is not letting me get into the other two levels .
this game is fun and addicting . the only downside is that it takes a long time to complete some of the tasks . other than that , it is a great game .
i like match 3 games but would like if there was a variety of different games . maybe further into games ? hopefully ?
where is the tablet love ? this would be awesome to have . sadly , i went to grab the app on my evo view tablet and got the message that it 's not compatible . why ?
me and my friend were playing with this and all these dots were popping up on the screen with words like die and hello children .
pretty easy , but a great way to spend a few minutes , if you can stop at a few minutes . slightly addictive .
just do n't start playing unless you have a lot of free time . once you get started it is hard to put down .
you have to get this game . i play it so many times a day i ca n't even count . your making a silly mistake if you do n't get this game .
love it ! this keeps me from dying of boredom in so many of my classes . the app is easy to use , and works really well
now this is what i am talking about , a different view of solitaire , that is so much fun to play .
this app is good but it would be so much better if they had the pocket addition for the kindle
nice game and it has lots of challenges . only complaint is the font of the letters . they are hard for kids to recognize . wish there was an option to change this !
this game is horrible it is so terrible i cry every time i play it and no one should get this app because it is worse than a killer
i use this app very often i use it a lot for school work . i think it 's easy and quick to use and i recommend it to other people
this is a cool game . it shows how to escape the titanic and it makes me feel like i 'm really there
takes way too long to download ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! more than thirty minutes but i 'm sure its a fun game . i am thinking about getting the full version .
it 's facebook , exactly what you would expect when you download it . i actually like it better than the ipad 's version myself .
i love this game ! i spend hours playing . the more friends you have to send you gifts and you send them back . you wo n't be disappointed . get the game and start playing .
similar to what others wrote . i uninstalled very quickly after getting it . i would ask for a refund if you paid .
not like one for android , but still good . it is fun easy enough , but not to simple . you can earn coins to buy hints . works great on kindle fire hd 8.9
love this app ! if you like word games you will love this one ! great way to kill time and maybe even learn a few new words !
the game makes you think . fun to play with your friends . i do not like writing reviews because of the word minimum .
i got this one mostly for my granddaughters . they love doing this and you will too . give it a try .
the graphic in this game are get and the sound and winnings are the best . this game takes a good part of my day after work download and enjoy .
this is a fun game . good for family play . children ages 11 and 14 really liked it . recommended for cold days .
really nice game . i love it . very unique and colorful . i definitely recommend this if your looking for a different type of puzzle game .
i love this type of puzzle game so it has been fun to move up the levels . it can get a bit boring but all in all i loved it .
awesome ... ... being a graphic designer this is a great tool to use on my android when i ca n't be near my laptop .
i would give this 0 stars if i could . i downloaded it and tried to play and it would n't let me choose a game , glad it was free .
pretty fun game . something to do when your bored . pretty simple game if your a restaurant person . i enjoy it !
this was a very good game . graphics and story and sound affects were great . well worth the money . you will really enjoy it . hoping for a sequel .
it 's fun and has a lot of different things that pop up . you are always seeing different things on the screen
there are six cards in each match . a low enough number for smaller kids to remember . kept my four year old busy for a while . good app for little girls .
nice graphics . cute theme . basic game . only played few levels so ca n't give full review . kid focused style game . enjoy .
great game love it ! very fun and fast paced . a different bingo for sure i would definitely . recommend it for everyone
we downloaded this to play with the new tablet we got for christmas . i enjoyed it but wish there were more puzzles to choose from .
this is the most challenging game i 've played . it 's so busy that your eyes are moving so quickly before time is up .
this app is good for me . need to learn english . this app help me so much . love app and love english songs !
i like how you can program it very easily and there are n't a lot of different buttons to push . the alarm always wakes me up .
it was sort of good because you play games to earn points and you use those points to get even more games .
i did n't enjoy it as much as i thought i would . i thought it was going to be way more fun than what it ended up being .
it is a nice relaxing game that i like to play to help unwind at the end of the day
this is such a fun game ! i love to play and the challenges are a twist that is added fun , i just wish there could be unlimited games without having to purchase coins .
it is very fun i really enjoy it a lot ! i am on the 5th one it is very addicting .
saved me from making plans in bad weather ! pretty accurate . i look this app up every time i make travel plans . i recommend it .
good puzzle game . has hard , medium , and easy levels for people with different skill level . quotes from famous people after finishing a level are enjoying to read . well worth the asking price .
this game is pretty cool my only wish is it will update the game its had the same little things on it
this game is fun ! it 's challenging , but not to the point of being frustrated . it 's a great way to pass the time .
so much fun i love this game . its harder than i thought it would be . five more words to submit
it does a good job looking for virus and spyware . would tell others about it if asked . worth keeping on kindle
this game is really a challenge . i love to play it . if you like to figure things out and like racing against a clock you will love this game and the graphics .
awesome great fun for all ages . the minions are so so cute i have told all my friends and family
i just love listening to a radio while i am playing a game . there is so many stations to listen to .
this app has all the excitement and fun of being at a las vegas casino without going to the poor farm ! great fun and it runs great on my kindle !
keeps my mind busy when i have nothing else pressing to do . so far i have lost more than i want to .
fun and informative i think i 'm addicted to these games they make you think . i would definitely recommend this and all the games in this series .
we could n't play it at all . would n't even load . i 'm sure it would have been a great game other wise .
this is really neat . you can draw rainbow cause all the colors are there with one swipe of your finger .
quit an easy game but never the less i liked the game a lot . you ask for too many words .
it works like the actual remote . a very good app to have when you ca n't find the real remote control .
without using the hints i have no idea how to move on . not for me to use . i do not like to play a game and keep checking on the answers .
my little girl plays this all the time now . even more om nom nom is what she says when i ask y she likes it .
it 's a relaxing but challenging puzzle game . there are tons of levels and the sound track is beautiful . it 's just a very well made game .
this is organized and easy to use . you cant use your finger of a stylus , but can use the typing feature ... for that it is fantastic ... great app ...
it is a fun game and has many levels that are challenging . i love because it is addicting . have fun ! ! ! !
i love imo . it 's just like it says . no matter what network your friends are on you can chat with them without having to switch over . this is a must have app .
very fun . i can play with my daughter . quirky way to end game . other than that its lots of fun .
did not care for this app , no special reason , just did not like it . did n't like the features or the way it worked . better video poker games out there .
fun had some problems with the focused pictures if pictures was not clear the images did n't come out clear but still fun
i mean its a good game but the controls ruined it for me i mean they were perfect in the first one but everything else is good
the variety of games and the ability to chose the games are great , along with the tutorials for them ! great graphics and easy to play !

this game is very fun and addictive . i play this game all the time and i really love it a lot .
it could be more challenging , it takes up time waiting somewhere . the graphics are good , would i purchase it again , probably ..

i 've only been playing for a few minutes but i can honestly say it is very well made and really fun to play . two thumbs up .
it 's a little long and challenging but really really fun to play and mess around on . this is a must get
the game would not open on my kindle fire . it crashed five times in a row and i uninstalled it . thank goodness i did n't pay anything for it !
great game do n't need to spend real money . unlike most games this one hands out gems ( real money currency ) for completing achievements also when there are updates
this is a really good app . its really nice to be able to open up an app and see how long you can use the internet .
have n't had the opportunity to really explore the functionality of this app but it was certainly easy to get and i assume it will be just as easy to use .
great game for toddlers . my daughter ca n't get enough of the dr. panda series . this is a welcome addition . more please !
i really like word games , and this one is my current favorite . it 's challenging enough to be fun but not so difficult as to be frustrating . i highly recommend .
this game was fun . scenes were clear and music was nice . i would recommend this game to anyone . i would buy it
found this game to be very fun ... challenging but able to solve puzzle game . slightly addictive . and definitely worth a try .
this game is a lot of fun . some clues are easy but some really stump you ! it really makes you think sometimes .
great game to play , need to be able to bet more , win more , so you play longer on the game
nice writing but i could n't erase which makes it difficult to sketch , particularly on the kindle screen . too difficult to keep starting over
game is too hard to win even after a week or more . very frustrating .
i have not yet had an opportunity to play this game , but it is waiting for me on my kindle .
i love cooking ! ! ! ! i would cook all day if i could ! with this i can ! so if you love to cook get it ! ! ! !

what a fun game ! you can do practice games by yourself or compete against friends . and it 's a fun way to keep your mind sharp ! addictive in a good way !
like i said in the title , what kind of a game uses a review in the description ? sounds like they are trying to sell you a crappy toy at an expensive price or something
i played this with my son and finished it in one night . it made us think . there are n't a lot of games that do that .
like the game very much . never heard of it before so i thought i 'd try it . i am glad i did
the controls are very picky . almost every time , i would swipe and she would n't do anything . terrible game , do not get .
like knowing how much of a charge my kindle has at all time . very easy to use . recommend it to all
i believe this game is amazing and it is so adorable ... i love it so much ... hope you like it ! ! ! : ) : ) : )
it & # 34 ; s fine but its just like all the other restaurant games but just hello kitty . little kids may like it .
this is a really well developed game this definitely deserves 5 stars . money is easy to make and the upgrades and armor are amazing and has a great storyline . buying the game was worth it .
works great on my kindle fire . i found it for my daughter and she loves it ! i recommend this app . /
waste of time . i do n't appreciate free games that require you to spend money to be able to get through different levels .
if not the best , or the first , at least the most known . my kids love it and i feel frustrated as they can do more than me ... !
worked great for saving recipes and is fast ! very easy to use and is going to save me tons of time .
the graphics are awsome the levels are awsome and the game is awsome i think its the best game ever
i never saw the point . this is another of those , & # 34 ; okay , i guess it works , but so what ? & # 34 ; apps . and another you can do without .
fun if you like bingo . moves along quickly but not too fast for slow old me . good to keep you alert .
i love it , its so easy to do from anywhere , when you do n't feel like going out you can do your banking from home .
this game is better than the first and has the best graphics , i have seen also best game ever seen .
this game is super hard but addictive and you ca n't stop cause you get the feeling that you need to complete this game but i doubt anyone ever has
it is nice to have easy access to the weather , i am always checking to see what it will be like when i am traveling , and at home .
because it 's a fun game and sometimes you have to actually think how to get past a level . it can get frustrating but try to see it as a challenge .
this is a fun game if you want the time to go by . i played for hours and did n't even realize it .
i liked this game and will play it again soon . it was fairly easy and the scenery was very nice . no time limit which is always a plus .
extremely addictive ... ca n't put it down once you start playing ! must have game for your device to pass time wherever you are
i like having the ability to go online with friends if i do n't want to use my computer . it 's convenient for when travelling .
i 'm enjoying this game and am looking forward to playing it as the time goes by . you can know great challenges without it being too hard .
i am a fan of office jerk and thought this would be as good or better . it is ok at best . i am going to stay with office jerk
this game will definatly give you a challenge . the aiming is like realistic movement . it is difficult that i can say .
good game but hated the part where the lights were out . no crashes . a lot of dialog . would play more like this .
this one will only be fun if you purchase the full app . it is frustrating that you ca n't make the pets well with what they give you for free . deleted after one try .
this one really gets your brain working . usually do the four pics but this one is awesome . would recommend this game to everyone who enjoys a good game . a good one for kids .
i love this game and the options to play many different versions of the game ! the game is very easy to navigate !
very cool . love the idea of following the story through the hidden object game . lots of ways to play and lovely artwork .
okay game fun to play , need better rewards and n more tickets when u sign in . all in all a pretty good game , win some lose some .
this is a great game i think they could make it a little bit better thought i love the game thought
fun way to pass a bit of time . a quick way to find out how little you know about some things and how much you 've forgotten about others .
i 've been using facebook for a few years now on my kindle , phone and home computer so you can obviously see that it 's a favorite of mine .
words are to easily found . i would like the words to be a little harder to find . but overall a game to waste time .
it is okay . i rarely use it though , but it does come in handy when i need to compare prices .
a fun and challenging game for all ages . me , i ran right off the edge and was done . my granddaughter had loads of fun with it and is a bit faster with the reflexes than i .
i ca n't figure out how to play it . i do n't want to play against people that i do n't know . i do n't like social games
great game . i play rpg 's all the time and this is a cute little game for the kindle . i give it a thumbs up
great game to play when you 're just looking for something to do . simple , but makes you think . adds do get a little annoying after a while , though .
fun , easy but makes you think ! it is free so give it a try . good brain game ! it is fun and addictive !
it was fun it takes a lot of space to use this game . by son liked it . but it just gives and error message
i find it addictive and funny . great workout for the brain . even my 70 year old mom likes to play it ! !
i played it a couple of times then uninstalled it . it was a little boring and the graphics are n't very bright .
there is nothing to this game . the graphics are terrible and small . just not what i 'm looking for in a bubble game . there are many others which are free which have much better quality game .
very good app . i got the free one and i had fun but the ads sucked so $ 1.99 is a great deal .
my son like it . and it 's just an ok game for me ... a little slow , but cute and something to do .
my family and i play each other all the time . i am amazed at what i have forgotten . lol i love this game . it 's fun for the whole family .
talk about an addiction ; i ca n't wait to get into a game with friends ; keeps your mind sharp and is fun doing so .
you can not beat the classics . it has plenty of replay value and keeps you entertained . do n't know what else to say .
game is fun to play would be even better if i could connect to facebook on my kindle fire hd .
very good . a variety of logos of easy and hard really gets you thinking . this game keeps you stumped and i really like that in a game .
this another classic from g5 . i have played it before and thought it would be a good game to have on my kindle fire hd .
the games are fun , but there are some technical problems . sometimes when i try to load a game , it just goes back to the menu . )
this game is good . really enjoy playing . wish you could get more free coins but they do have good deals for them .
i think u will like this app its really fun . everyone needs to try it . i give five stars
the entire family loves this one -- kids and adults . within one day we had it on my kindle fire and six cell phones !
this was downloaded for my nephew and he enjoys playing it as often as possible on my tablet . some of my older nieces and nephews play as well .
love this game , my children got me hooked on it . i play it over and over . it is very addicting .
i like the designs they give you . however they only give three designs the rest you have to buy or rate for which is a hassle .
great on kindle fire , no problems . fun way to keep up with friends you enjoy playing with . i have played with both my sisters for a year ! i would recommend this game yo anyone .
this is a great calculator for fractions and regular calculations . i 'm so glad i got it . i would recommend . this to anyone !

i used to play this game when i was younger . now my grandchildren have got me playing it again . yes i would recommend this to any age group . it helps keep the mind young .
i felt this go did not give the player more free tokens . you would have to purchase more to continue to play for more than a few minutes . deleted app from tablet .
i love this place and am always on when i get the chance i really love the games and being able to connect with my friends
this game is fun and challenging . it is fun to ask friends and family and sometimes the answers are funny .
not at the level of angry birds for me but still fun . um , not as difficult to stop playing , that is , it is not addicting .
this game was the worst game you could ever play this game all you do is just slide the picture and your done
great game . i wish u had different tasks to complete and could play against other human players . filler filler filler filler
it gives you 4 choices it is not fun if u download the game u r stupid and u will be mad and hate this game i wish they would of made it much more fun
love the game ! it is very challenging and is rewarding when a new level is reached . it is fun to compete with my friends as well . definitely a good time .
its a time killer . pretty fun for kids and anyone interested in fashion . most likely it will get boring in a few weeks .
love this game . the only down side is its very hard to place in the top three and only slightly easier to get a bingo without having bonuses .
i love this bingo game ! ! ! it 's so user friendly and easy . my daughters love playing this game too . fun fun
not much to it for having to pay for it.i do not really want to do these reviews so i would prefer that you do n't send them . thanks
this game is super fun and challenging but the problem with this game is that there are so many adds ! so your ca n't get past anything until you 've reached the add : (
i do n't watch or listen to enough of this stuff to play this game is the only reason i gave it a 1 star .
this is a fun addictive game . i played it for hours . gets a little harder with each level . highly recommend .
i decided it was not worth the trouble after working with it for a little while . i found it more complicated than it needed to be .
fun to play . not limited like most free games . it 's fun to keep trying to top my scores after unlocking all the levels .
this is really an addictive game , you can play for hours without stopping . once again , my husband loves this one !
just okay ! nothing special here ! and not what i thought it would be or as good as i thought it would be !
this game is freaking sweet ! ! i play it on the kindle fire and it responds really nicely , and on top of that ... ... its free ! ! ! ! ! i highly recommend it .
this game is a nice little diversion . it 's easy to learn and fun to play . i like to play it on coffee breaks or on the bus .
it 's an okay game but really could n't get into it . i play it when i 'm not playing one of the others !
they have a lot , but there could be more words , the navigation in the program could be made easier , but that may be just the kindle .
everyone knows this by now , but this is a very fun , relaxing and addictive game . definitely recommend for someone who likes relaxing yet strategic games .
this games is really good u should get it . the best game ever its so fun and it has more than the other temple . run
once you get th hang of it , it 's actually pretty fun . i 'm glad i downloaded it , i suggest it ! : )
i got addicted to it them upgraded my phone and did not reload it because of the time it wasted .
this makes me laugh . good for keeping your brain sharp . it 's unique , fun , and funny . sometimes it 's fun to actually let them die !
great free game its really easy to control everything unlike some games on a tablet ... plenty of weapons and u do n't have to spend real money to beat the game !
this was n't fun for me or my kids . it was hard to use and seemed really pointless . not worth the money .
i absolutely love this game . love to play hidden picture games and this is a good one . lots of fun !
i enjoy playing with my friend and family . it is easy enough for anyone to play . love the changes you can make to your character
i really enjoy this game . it 's easy to use and a nice time waster game . only complaint is that you have to have a wifi connection to play .
i thought it was a fun game and all but i thought it was kind of annoying . also they only give u 12 levels .
it is a great app will read to you and has lots of other stuff greatest app ever get you will not regret
this is a great app for checking accounts on your kindle on the road or just on the go or where ever
i love to play solitare games . this selection is nice with all the different games . instructions included . you should try it .

good game to keep you guessing . throughout all the years . even if you do n't know you can see things from the past and the present . fun game
this game is fun , and something to challenge your eye coordination . try the game and solve the mystery items that are involved .
this product makes it possible for me to enjoy my music even more wen i read or work . easy to adjust to taste .
it 's just like the version on my laptop . it 's great . i play it everyday on my break and when i bored . it 's a good he to help pass the time .
this is a terrific game i highly recommend it ! ! ! get this game now you will have so much fun ! ! ! hope you are able to get it !
great life and funny quotes and love that u can save the pic quotes to your email or facebook to send to friends : )
uno is a great card game and to have an app for my kindle is even better ! the app is great it 's colorful fun and exciting !
this game was super fun and it kept me entertained . love the g5 games and i ca n't wait for more !
everything on it works well except the pictures take a long time to load . if someone updates there profile picture this app will often show there old profile pic as well .
i really like this game its fun . helps pass time and is n't boring because its a puzzle it has current and older songs making it fun for everyone
it was n't such a bad game when i first downloaded it , but after the update now you have to pay with real money for upgrades . not worth it . i deleted it after 5 minutes .
the game is great . it keeps my five year old busy . i would recommend this game to others to play .
my aunt and cuz told me about it and now i 'm addicted . it does need to work on ads but other than that its amazing and fun for every age : o )
another game to help your memory of bible text and facts . not a bad game but some others are more challenging .
this game is top of the line . the graphics are amazing . its easy to play but it has its challenges . i recommend this app for anybody who has a kindle fire .
it is just for random if you want to guess your mood idk a mood ring works better . it was not the quality i expect
this is a good game for all ages ! i think you should try . its worth it ! i love all ages games to ! and i 'm 9 !
this app works very well - simple clean look to it as well . the search bar makes it easy to find what you are looking for .
so interesting and fun . love the puzzle feature trying to get through the maze and go to the next level .
i think it is awesome because you can listen to songs you have never even heard of there is just one thing there is too many ads but i still love this app
very different form the other hidden object apps . not as good or fun . you might like it and it is free .
this game lets you no all sort of restaurants and let 's you know your signs for the restaurant it helps in all sorts of ways .
it 's straight forward and easy to use , no photos to use up space . plus , it has great radar . a good app to have .
this is so far my favorite of the angry birds games . it is so much fun . the puzzles are very interesting and some very fun new & # 34 ; bird & # 34 ; types .
i love to hear the music as you try to see how fast you can go to beat your last time .
this is a regular logo game . it would have been good if they had shown the logo when it is solved . there ia a small check mark only .
i like this because it is n't extremely challanging and it is worth having if you just like to relax and play a game .
this game is very fun and very addictive . it was easy to figure out how to play and with the amount of puzzles its a great way to pass the time
out of the many horrible games in the world this is one of them ! it looks fun at first but it is very boring and lame so unless you like games like that do n't get this app
give it a 3 out of 5 because the hints are very vague and cost too much . worth the free download
i like the app , but it took forever to find the right one to download . i am perfectly happy to continue reading from my paper subscription .
good puzzles ; hidden objects ; good storyline . ca n't wait for the next one to come out . it could have been a little more difficult so that it was more challenging . but still fun .
i love this app ! i do n't have a phone , only a kindle fire , but magic jack is exactly the same as a phone ! the sound is so great , too .
this is a cute little learning game . the beginning is a little confusing but once you get the hang of it its fun . i recommend this game for all ages .
things are hidden very well . when the image is shown its a little tougher , that 's why i like to play without a clock timing me
good game to pass time with . wish there were more choices in each section . but other than that a good game !
in my opinion this game was pretty boring . you can download it if you do n't believe me , but its pretty lame
it is a horrible game . do n't download this . i hate this game . it is a waste of time . deserves zero .
love being able to see the weather on the go and for traveling . love being able to check weather when planning to travel .
lots of fun to play , may be a bit expensive , but definitely worth the price . tons of levels to play .
the nice thing about this is you can use different puzzle piece sizes so the same puzzle is different each time by increasing the number of pieces .
this game is so cool and i share this with my cousin and sister they love it so much they jump on it ever since i had this game
addictive , hate to put it down . fun game . challenging enough but not too much to get frustrated . looking forward to more .
was able to download but was not very engaging . played for about five minutes then removed from my kindle fire .
do n't know ) yet key word yet lol seems pretty cool do n't know what to do but is good so be cool
was fun at first . then i got stuck . it forces you to play the same level over and over again . and whats with the spyware ? its a game , not a virus .
i have an idea for another & quot ; story & quot ; . a kingdom story . you could build your own kingdom and complete quests to expand it . cool right ?
has some real good puzzles some that where so so . at the price for $ 1.99 good deal for the buy
this is a fun game but i think there should be more options for the rooms and i do n't know how to update or get a dungeon
searching anything whatever i want it will be seen on the internet silk on kindle fire but i feel like do n't wan na use it
i love the graphics and fast pace of this game . i had never played it on facebook but now i enjoy diamond dash as much ad candy crush saga .
great games offer a little of everything to challenge your mind . not sure which of the challenges i like the best . they vary the type to keep it from becoming too repetitive or boring .
lets me me use my twitter account on my kindle : ) works great ! so yea you have to have so many words to submit a review !
i love this game its so much fun i played it on my sisters nook tablet and they did n't have the same one on the kindle fire but i do n't care i love this game
i ca n't put it down once i start i love the one movement mode i could play forever if i would n't reach the top would recommend this game to others
so fun just like the tv show . fun , entertaining and a great way to fill time . would recommend this game for anyone who enjoyed the tv show .
this app would n't download . kept giving a load error every time i tried .
fun little game to pass the time away . so far works great . love playing it . looks pretty kid friendly as well .
just like on my phone except easier to see because of the kindle being larger . would recommend this to others .
i can see the numbers and playing multiple cards is so easy . this is the one game that i do n't mind purchasing more chips .
fun ! and not competitive ! better than bingo blitz in that way ! it 's nice to just have fun ! who made this game ?
i have been playing the game for awhile and ca n't put it down . there are lots of chances to win .
this is a fun and exciting game . it took me awhile to decide if i wanted to download this game , but now i 'm glad i did .
not what i expected . it always said i was happy and that was n't the case . there needs to be more of a variety
this is the real temple run and really works awesome ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
i found it confusing to try to play this game on my kindle fire . therefore i have decided to delete it ...
i am using it on a kindle and not having any problems at all . i like the variety of puzzles within the puzzle . highly recommend . : )
love the weather , and radar and how the app is set up ... it is so much better then weather channel 's app
it is a nice app , quite fun and addictive . as usual you have to pay to get more coins for hints like every guessing game .
great series of games with different things to do in every title released . gives my child an excuse to & # 34 ; ask nicely & # 34 ; for my tablet lol !
this is a fun little game . you run out of balls to quick but if you just want a game that takes a minute to play than this is perfect
finally able to enjoy pinterest in an easy to navigate app ! works great on my kf and i love the updates . pin all the things ! !
love this game very fun to play and share with the family . i enjoy the game sounds makes you very happy ! ... .
fun game i am already stuck but my friends enjoy helping me out . the last few games i played like this were way to easy
you have to buy to much of the stuff in this game or the game will be kinds difficult . but other than that this is a pretty good game
this is a great workout . you are never to young to work out , and this is okay for that . i 'm 12 and i can use this !
i love this game so much . i play this more than minecraft pocket edition . i deleted a lot of old games .
down load works great , enjoy watching the shows . there is always something diffrent , very informative . the boys love it just as much as i do
good app but not great just needs more detail in the forecasts . a travel weather info option would be nice also .
good game but i wish they would 've given me more coins to start with . i m stuck at level 15 and will not buy coins so i guess i 'm done .
this is great puzzle to make you think with instant feed back . thanks for having it for the kindle fire .
this is a awesome game for all ages . many will enjoy this awesome game . i hope you like it as much as i do ! : )
i have waited for this to come out on the kindle . so much easier to see then it was on my phone .
again they hit the nail on the head ! this is an amazing platform for a game style . the game is wonderful .
love this game , keeps me busy while travelling with friends or family members . awesome game to play alone ! it 's great !
my grandchildren love this it , it 's a great way to get young children use to a tablet . therefore they will learn to understand how to use it in a fun way of doing so
awesome app ! this is sooo much more fun than temple run or subway surfers ! nice job gameloft ! i love the cute characters and the awesome places and the event update is pretty cool !
great app for i phone and kindle ! easy to use and no glitches so far ! love it ! would recommend it .
interesting puzzle game . there is only one way to solve the puzzles . it 's fun at first , but can quickly get frustrating . i like puzzles , but this got old fast .
this game is greater this game is good you should n't hesitate to get it it is very good but you have to rate it to get all bird colors .
i can not change the look of the tiles so that i can feel comfortable playing this game . the background also can not be changed .
it works well . it works very fast and has n't let me down to date . i recommend this free download for a quick clean up of your cache .
app was a lot of fun . some of the levels make you work at it but overall piece of cake . app was really short though
i 've been looking for a game with a variety of puzzles that is challenging and fun . this is it and you do n't have to spend money to play if you do n't want to .
fast learning curve . i could not put it down for way to long did not become boring or repetitive . great game fun and well done .
this is fun and it makes me laugh . just be careful of that theme song though . once you get it in your head , you ca n't get rid of it .
this little app gives you an excellent stop watch with multiple lap times as well as a basic stop timer functionality . very friendly interface and super functional !
this is the best game i ever played . u need to get it now ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! it is so easy to play .
so glad that amazon finally got this app . love this game . very addictive . plays really well on the kindle fire . no glitches so far .
i have had pou for 2 weeks or so , and i cant wait till i can afford some outfits for her though ...
temple run is one of my favorite games because you jump run and turn . you collect coins and buy stuff
fast moving game that holds your attention . plenty of wins and free chips . your friends can receive and send gifts of chips and free spins .
it was very easy to follow ! had a great time . once you got started , you did n't want to stop till it was done .
this is a pointless but fun ap particularly for kids - which i am not . makes a decent , if battery wasting , flashlight !
i find the new updates has made it more enjoyable and it gives better credits . worth giving a try . nothing to loose only better payouts to achieve .
hands down my absolute favorite site .it 's the 1st place i go to when i turn on my kindle in the morning ! ! !
not sure about this game for me . it seems just ok. it take to much time to go between games . but grandson loves it : )
like the game got to level 21 before needed help did n't know some words but love to learn so give it a try
this app is really fun and you can easily find yourself playing it over and over ! it 's hard to stop even to rate the app !
i love this app i was in the app store and saw it my sister said i should buy it . so i did ( just for her ) now its my favorite app ! ! !
it 's alright gets really boring really fast only reason for keeping it is for my niece who 's almost two years old
so much fun , gives you plenty of tokens to keep playing ; i return to this game most often . thanks for offering a great game .
i love this game ! it 's better than the real games ! this is the perfect distraction for those boring long wait times we all experience .
sometimes i ca n't figure out what one of the pictures have to do with the word . i used to wait but now i go with three .
so much fun ! ! just like a real pinball machine but on my kindle ! ! ! could spend hours just playing it ! ! worth the time to install ! thanks !
the other games were awesome so i 'm excited for this one . i 'm awesome cause i 'm the third person to write a review
what makes this bingo so exciting is you do n't have to wait for each ball , you control the pace of the numbers being called . the more bingos you get the more rewards you earn .
i enjoyed this very much and will start again soon . had to put the kindle down for a while so i could do some work !
this is such a fun game . keeps you playing & passing the time . best ive ever played . its free and give it a try .
& hearts ; this app is a lot of fun ! i have spent hours playing with this and it has n't gotten old yet . great for all ages !
played on kindle fire . excellent graphics , great story line . wish it was longer , but for 99 & cent ; you ca n't beat it .
just completed floor nine to realize that was the last floor ! i was really enjoying playing this game and really hope they are working on more floors !
it did not work on my kindle fire hd as the alarm was too soft to be heard otherwise it is & # 34 ; fine & # 34 ; .
i liked it for the moment but it was very slow . i could n't deal with it so i uninstalled it sorry .
did n't like the game , was n't what i expected when i downloaded it and i deleted this game from my kindle .
fun game . gets your brain in right brain so lose track of time . goes from easy to hard to easy etc . tricky at times too . does n't cost to skip which is nice .
i was n't impressed with this app . i was bored and not very challenging . still looking for a challenging bubble game .
i bought this app months ago , and love it . it makes saving websites to read in bed a breeze , and formats them to make them easier to read .
looked like it would be fun to play but i could not get it to play for more than a minute
i think this is really fun . there are a few inappropriate things but other than that it is awesome there are glitches , some funny , some not . like sometimes that walk through another .
it starts out fairly easy and keeps you moving forward then it takes a turn for the worst . not easy to move to the next level , so you quickly lose interest of playing this game .
this game is really fun but it is pretty hard to get money on the game please make it so we can get more money
i am still learning to play this game , but it is fun nonetheless . also you ca n't beat a free game that keeps you entertained .
i like the sound effects with each different animal . it is just as entertaining as the original mahjong with a new little twist .
great game works great on my kindle fire has never crashed once definitely worth 99 cents buy it now it 's awesome
hours of fun i love this app . we play at least once a day . the kids love it too .
this is one of the best game i have ever playing before it teaches u how to take care of something
make you buy too much stuff that you do n't need and way too many battles that do n't help you at all
i like this game . my son loves to play it as well . i also like the different versions . i have this game on my iphone as well .
it 's so cute . i love playing it and so do the kids i baby sit . he 's fun to listen to . and fun to watch grow
this is a very average game with little chance to customize deck or deals . do n't look for any real challenges in this offering .
lots of fun ... have n't tried everything yet , but lots of choices . would definitely recommend to anyone who likes to play mahjong .
i use a kindle fire . i have tried again and again to connect to facebook as well as the apps very own store and anytime i click a non game play button the entire game freezes then crashes .
i love word games and this is fun and different . its a nice change of pace and the game has no permissions .
it is challenging ! ! ! have tried it and the time limits still get me . i 'll keep trying it and see how it goes .
i am really enjoying this app , glad i downloaded it ! it works parts of the brain you may not use in normal day to day life .
it works well with my kindle fire . i can go on real quick , look at the headlines , and go on to other things
easy to use . makes posting easy and fast . i can check my account from my kindle now not just at home .
it 's okay , my 5 yr old says he likes it . the boys say that it 's too hard when you get to level 2
i downloaded this app to entertain myself & amp ; my daughter . it kept saying i messed up 3 notes into each song . got so frustrating i 'm uninstalling .
at first i thought this was going to be a boring game . as i continued to play it got better and better . now i cant wait to get back to it .
i enjoy the game , but i would like it a lot more if i was able to skip one if i do not know it . it is very frustrating being stuck and unable to go forward .
a very enjoyable game . i definitely recommend it . it is very relaxing and easy without being too easy . give it a try .
i really like bakery story but this game is certainly giving it some competition ! thank you again teamlava ! amazon i have nothing else to say ... ...
love this game can not get enough of it . it 's the best game ever , to me once you try . you will get hooked . : )
about the whole update thing , i waited a day or two and the update was there . the fan s really cool and people should wait before they complain about their being no update .
the best game ever ! ! ! ! great ! ! ! ! worth $ $ $ you should get it i turned even the tv off crazy right crazy just crazy
i like it so far ... wish it did n't take so many coins to open up other levels . or that i could accumulate the coins faster ...
i love this app because i love puzzles also the pics are great and its something the whole family can enjoy
i love this game so much it is my favorite app in my app slide deserves a solid 5 stars
a great way to waste away a few minutes or a few hours . zombies ... how could you possibly go wrong with zombies ? worth playing .
i play this game almost all day ! ! ! ! ! the only thing thing that i would add is probably a double tap kind of thing . other wise it 's an amazing game ! ! !
this game is great i really like hidden object games and if you do to you will really like this one
i was promised free amazon coins . i ever got them . the download is huge . it took forever . and the game was quite boring
this game took me 3 hour to complete when i was playing it in the car . fun easy to understand and really it could kinda be a two player game . i would recommend it to anybody .
kind of hard to get used to some of the items are hard to find . i find it nice that the hints are n't limited .
this is the new game to get addicted to ! runs great on the kindle fire . i recommend everyone try this one out .
both of my kids like to play with this application they love it and they have fun with the pictures and painting it
this game is sweet and its for free you should get it.it has easy movies as long as you watched or heard about them .
game asks the same questions over and over , there is no challenge , no steps to get harder questions . just all out boring .
this is a game that is fun and can become addictive . i have finally reached a level that is extremely challenging to get through .
great follow up from first game and graphics much improved . areas of game are challenging and mini games too : )
sometimes it is difficult to see what level a tile is on to see if it is available for use .
this game is a cool game ive been trying 2 look 4 it but it did not respond so now i have it awesome game u should get it .
what 's to say about solitaire . i have another version that i like better . i do n't know how to play anything but plain ole solitaire
not one of my favorite , sometimes it get alittle boring but i still do play it from time to time . this is one that i would n't recommend .
you could play this game for hours and hours . it is a lot of fun i love it . you should buy it .
fix this app right away or i will cancel my netflix subscription together other 2 million kindle fire owners . cant watch anything .
i do n't like that i can only see few things on my news feed . it only shows like 5 stories and that 's it ! and there is no way i can check the other ones
this is a awesome game best graphics ever seen in a mobile video game if you have a android or iphone download now 5stars ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
what is the difference between this one and the original letters from nowhere because i think the only thing g5 is trying to do is get people to spend another 3 dollars on a game people already bought
this game requires some imagination and concentration . the doors are interesting and varied . it is an overall fun game for everyone .
it is mind boggling , and at the same time very fun and addicting ! it is not very easy which makes it fun
this game is rated a 5 out of 5 stars in my book . i love it . the more you do in this game the more you get back out of it . the collections part is fun to
this is a awesome game when they say when pigs fly they mean it in this game . you should get it
this is a great time passer game . it 's a matching game like bejeweled that lets you advance in levels . i like that it 's seems never ending .
it has great quality and definitely keeps u busy : ) so i ur in the mood for a puzzle making mind timing game flow free is the one for you !
i was getting kind of bored and figured i 'd check the game out . it 's actually kind of fun and i like the fact that it keeps me entertained when i have nothing to do .
i have tried several time to get this to work and it will not even let me sign in on my phone to see my books
i thought this game might be boring but since it was free i decided to try it and i 'm now addicted to this game ! great graphics , lots of levels ! lg optimus
perfect app for people who love drawing and collect and love guns . learn how to draw your favorite weapon in easy to learn steps
it 's awesome . i could n't get flappy bird on my kindle so this was the perfect alternative . definitely deserves five stars ! ! ! !
i love every thing about all the papi games from the first all the way to right now i think that this game was very entertaining .
this is the best game i have gotten on my kindle by far . i got it when it was 1 $ best money spent .
there are only limited puzzles available for free - but what do you expect for free , right ? the ones that were available were ok .
silly sounds and noises . graphics too cartoon like . childish . no multi player version . the game is not that great honestly . sorry .
this site has so many great ideas and things to do ! ! ! i have many friends sending me great ideas .
love this game it 's so fun . i love old times and old things love the look of this game . enjoy finding out what 's next .
this app is the boom i love and when i make my cats look funny on here he will sit on my lap and watch i recommend it but there is not that much free but yea download it

i am a sudoku nut . this is an easy to use version , and fun too . i definitely recommend this game .
runs ok on the htc evo but just not for me . graphics are ok very comic book style . sound fits the game play .
i played it on my iphone first and was thrilled to find it as a free kindle app ... bonus coins hourly ... and new locations coming all the time . great download .
i had this twice already and i thought how it will be better well i thought wrong . when i tried to create one it kept on saying sorry !
straightforward time waster . no problems . pictures are small on by droid razr m but ok when clicked . may get repetitive after a while .
i love puzzle games and i really loved doors and rooms one so i 'm hoping the one will be as good i do n't know because i 've only finished a few levels so far
i do like this game and think it is easy . i like trying to figure all of this stuff out , but do n't want to get too involved .
i do n't think it is a bad game , but i limit the type of games i want them playing and constantly having shooting as a theme is n't my idea of a good day .
the game is good . keeps my son occupied for hours . definately recommend for someone downloading this for their child . you ca n't go wrong with sonic !

okay of a game but i do n't really care for it went a little slow and i do n't really care
kept getting the same message over and over , not able to connect to network . there was nothing wrong with the network , just the program .
i 'll have to give it a little more play time before i can really say for sure ... but so far it 's a cute app .
i play this game at least once a day and i never get sick of it . it 's a really fun game . : d
kindle fire - the app works fine enough but gets boring too fast & did n't hold my attention . i played 1 level & removed it .
so fun i love it so much i have been so happy that i ca n't hate it oh i love you big fish thank you so much
i did not realize that this was not like the real arcade game . i used to play this game on n actual game console . so for what it is , the game is a good one .
a different version of solitaire , much like playing with two players instead of one . if you have the time this version can be the challenge
i spend so much time playing this . i use this app more than any other thing on my kindle . it is so fun !
for cribbage players it 's a fun game to pass the time . have n't gone online with it , but i enjoy the game .

needed to be able to watch areas i travel . excellent for my needs . it 's quick and gives enough info for my use
i play this once in a while when i am bored . however , this is not the game i would pick up everyday .
me and my mom play the game when were bored ! ! ! this game is totally worth it ! ! ! you can also play nonlinear with random people .
this is the most boring game i ever had played never get this game ever . it also runs out your battery so do n't get this stupid game ! ! ! ! no wonder its free !
i 've never played flappy birds before but i think that this is probably the exact thing its very very fun
this is a decent game . have n't played it in a while since i got it so it obviously did n't hold my attention super great .
good to get a quick review of what the current news of the day is . able to read the items that interest me and not the ones i am not interested in .
minecraft is the best game in history . if u like minecraft and looking for more minecraft related games , try survival craft
this game is fun especially when hanging out with friends . some of the pictures do n't make any sense but can be figured out with one clue .
my 1 year old loves it . it is interactive and keeps his attention through the story . great read along . try it out .
this game has potential but my games were not being saved when i was done playing for the time being .
i 'm not a pizza fan , but this is a really cool game . the only flaw is in app purchasing . i just hate that
do not get this game it is very stupid and boring , it is also very slow , remember do n't get it is is stupid and not fun
follow the instructions if you are little kids who knows they could spend money on this app and they could write a review .
it is so cool i wish i could play on it all day and the pics are so funny and if i were u i would say something
for me this app wont load . i do not know if anyone else has had this problem ? in my opinion a good app should run well for any device .
great game . i have n't played in a while , but when i do , it is great . the words are great choices .
i kept going back to this game it was so much fun , it gave me the option to try again when i wanted to improve my score .
i love this game but the fact that you have to pay about a dollar more for updates kinda stinks other than that its absolutely amazing
useful , intuitive , easy to use , cross platform , web and computer based allowing sync between equipment . fire version does not seem as easy as computer version , but is reliable and high quality .
my wife uses this for background noises to help her fall asleep , does the job well and she likes the selection of sounds .
listen to almost any station you want or make your own radio station to listen to . i use it when my radio does n't work or if i 'm at school .
fun word puzzle that makes you think and not in just one way . gives you a chance to learn as well when it comes to vocabulary .
this is a poorly put together page . you have to jump around to find the news and it 's a bad layout .
i got this for my grandson just like all the other games . he really likes them all . i am happy with every game i have downloaded for him .
it did just the opposite for me . i like peace and quite or nice soothing music but this was talking and i hated it . sorry just me .
i was browsing around when i found this game app . it looked like my style , so i went for it . pretty cool so far . i think my daughter will totally like this .
i play this every night to wind down from my hard day at work , it 's very relaxing yet very challenging .
if you like adventure hidden object games with lots of puzzles you will find this both interesting and challenging . hard to put it down . love g5 games . state of the art . well worth the money .
this was gotten by mistake , and i do not like guns i tried to play it but i hate a game like this
i enjoy playing bingo and on here i can do it and not use my real money . i enjoy it .
look the people who gave it less then 5 you are dumb and are not cool but the others that gave it 5 are real cool
easy to play , graphics are nice on the eyes . just like a real game and highly addictive . would definitely recommend this game .
i really enjoy these games . i like all the different locations that make the game more interesting . keep the g5 games coming .
there is just enough of a challenge in these games to make them fun too . keep up the great work . thank you .
i like this better than the other casino games . the slot is loose and rewards easily . only small issue is the screen seems to stick on play bonus .
it 's really entertaining , easy to play . lots of different types of games to play . just wish it had more options .
fun game but for an old guy with his first android it can be a little hard to use for a first time user and the price point overall a fun game .
must not have liked this one very much . i do not remember having it and/or i did not keep it .
this game is addictive . great fun to play . i am using a kindle fire hd 8.9 and the graphics are good . simple to play .
the app would let me on but would n't do anything ! i 'm so angry and frustrated with this app ! fix it or i will definitely delete it !
i really love this app . i hopefully do n't need to use it right now , but it will come in handy one day when i might need to look for another job .
its a good game if you like facebook type games but i just do n't care for the layout or playing style . i just do n't find it very fun .
so cute so fun and so addictive ! you have got to get it . i loved it so so so much ! ! !
fun game . enjoyed . it a lot . the price is right so you ca n't go wrong . go for it and have some fun .
this game is ok for a little while but not for long . even my son , who loves to play games on my phone , did not play this for long .
this app is more fun than the one on facebook . you get the things you need so you can p in a reasonable amount of time . )
this is the best app to use if u need light to help u see this app is sick this is a must get app
just the thing to relax with . i hope to find more like this . simple and quiet . the story seems to be pure fantasy but i could share this with any one .
unable to play because a screen pops up to upgrade . when i clicked on it i am told i already have it . very annoying .
love this game ! gives me something to do when i 'm bored that is actually working my mind . hope they keep making levels to play !
this is a really fun game but i really wish they had more hints because some levels are really hard ! ! !
pic mix is a really fun game because you can ask anyone in your family to help you if you do n't now the answer .
i liked this app is was fun to find the objects in the picture if you like this type i would download it .
i enjoy this game . challenging and a little different . colorful and more than your average bubble game . i recommend this game . playing on the kindle fire .
wish you could play longer without having to rely on real money to continue . but the live play online is fun and the interface is intuitive enough .
this is a very fun game , and easy to play . i love the kindle edition , and play it often . i would definitely recommend this game to those who enjoy this type of game .
i use to play this game all the time when i was younger . its nice to see some of the old games again keeps me feeling young .
it 's a good game , and easily entertains my children when need be . besides you just ca n't beat a free game : )
i found this game dull and boring . i like games that require either thinking or control skills and this seemed to offer neither .
i read all the food reviews , thinking this game would be good . i was wrong because i ca n't even log in .
i like the size of the remote control , i also enjoying seeing the channel selections . this a very useful app .
i love having it all together and not having to carry so many books . it 's fabulous . you should get it id you do n't have it .
this game is now one of my favorite to play even when i 'm bored . so you should buy this fun game .
this game is really cool but i wish they could of added more guns . but over all this app is pretty awesome .
i have tried several calculator apps on my phone , but i like this one the best . has many functions , but if you are doing just simple math applications it allows you to do them quite easily .
awesome , easy , makes you feel smart . also , great relaxing music to go along with it . the only problem is that you cant put it down !
this game is soooooo cool you get to dress up . a press and do a make up cool and hair
unlike another light app i tried , this one actually does what it says and does it every time . very handy at night .
good game nice little story . graphics are great and works well on kindle fire . longer then most games in this genre .
the game is easy to access and with different levels of play can be as easy or as challenging as you prefer .

this game is awesome it 's so fun but i ca n't even get passed the first level it is so amazing
this game is okay but so many of the objects are very small and hard to see . i do like the variety of screens though .
it seems easy at first then it starts to get challenging as you work further into the game ... its fun and help time pass by .

once you get the controls down , it 's a very easy game . plus it is addicting ! i recommend this game for people who like shooting games .
i like this game because it make me think and i spend lots of hours of entertainment . i will recommended to all my friends .
i really enjoy doing the logo games but find myself using a lot of hints because they are quite hard .
i thought this game would be fun but it just glitches out all the time so it sucked every time i played
i like this kindle version way better than the computer version because its so much easier to touch the screen rather than use the mouse .
i am bout to delete the app cuz i never play it cuz it does n't do me well and i do n't get it

this is a fun game to play . i think it is good for people to work their brain . great game
do n't know right now ... ... ... ... . do n't know ... ... ... ... how to know later about this game so i come back and let you know
you do n't ever win . it is a slow game , there are no instructions on how to play . no clear way to see pay outs .
just do n't like these type of games . i thought it was going to be different . you may like it but i just do n't
i love this site . it is amazing how many times i can go there and find help in my daily walk with god . love the reading plans . and being able to use different versions .

it is a bad app it 's really slow you get a really small area do n't get it no doors there is only 5 items .
this game is a blast to play . especially if you like puzzles where you need to select or move items to win .
my daughter loves this lil dragon . she thinks its like having a pet . great app guys . i hope it continues . to be awesome .
if you enjoy bowling , this is the next best thing to being at a real bowling alley . the sound effects also add to the fun of playing .

love the game just need more boards to play . cause ones u beat them it done . fun for all the family
really fun game . easy to play and interesting idea . i only wish it were longer , too bad there are only ten levels . add more levels !
.great game . if you like hidden items . i few twist from other hidden games i 've played . i would recommend it .
it wo n't work on my kindle hdx , so have n't even been able to try . might have been a really good game if it would load .
the only complaint i have is that i could not increase the size of the hidden object portion . will purchase the sequel .
better than flappy birds ! but i 'm not as good at it as flappy birds . other wise the game is really fun .
i think it would be awesome to play the game because my friend has it and she likes to play it .
i thought that this game offered very little in instructions on how to play . it was not at all what i was expecting when i purchased it .
i have n't played it yet . its still downloading ... but i give it five stars cause u guys said it was good . i hope it worth it cause is taking forever !

please change the background it is hard to see the tiles but a good game cant play long at a time
my 16 month old son loves this . there is n't much to it , but it keeps him entertained . and it 's only .99 .
so fun you should get it . it teaches you how to take care of something or one . i love it . i already have 5 sims

i love it is is a fun and entertaining game : - ) it 's so much fun ... i just started but plan on getting the full version
all the libii salon games are really fun . they are all pretty much the same , but all of them are different in different ways . i think there cool .

i have no clue what this game is about . it look like a good game . i do n't have anything to download it onto .

been using es file manager for quite a while - my last three smartphone - and could n't get along with out it . great app ! ! !
it 's just a calculator , but its nice application for kindle to have on hand when you need it . i love it !
this game has so many interesting levels . and each one becomes slightly more difficult than the last . i enjoy a challenge and if you do too this game is definitely worth trying .
i really like this game . fun to play . enjoy the concept . of all the slots my favorite . so would recommend it .
i think this game is quite entertaining . it keeps me guessing all the time . really great to pass the time with also .

no matter how much your reviews are good it does n't even let me download i can not play please fix it please .
i liked this game but it kept locking up and i would have to restart it and reload it . now it is just locked . waste of money .
i love this game ! the song that plays during the credits is especially catching ! for an added challenge , try to complete all the achievements !
love this app ... taught myself to play cribbage on it ! it is easy to navigate , never crashes on my droid and the new achievements are cool .
i play a lot of these ho games . this is a great one . mini puzzles could be improved but everything else was way above average . length on game is very good too .
the game is addictive indeed . just be patient if you run out . otherwise , buy coins . i recommend using the game .
this is a great app to have to make you laugh , you should really get it some stories are inappropriate but great and funny this app is awsome .

first of all i think is a really cute and adorable game to play i have not try it yet but i will and i think i will really like it
played the game for three days and really enjoyed it . the quests were great without being impossible to solve . fun game .
loving the amount of levels and sections . the graphics are great . this is visually and mentally fun . i 'm loving the various themes .
if you want the same stuff that is on here then just go to google and it would be easier then waiting !
this app is great ! ! it is great for anywhere ... . anytime ... when i want to watch something boom ! i can get out this app to watch it..
even though it downloaded fine , i could not get this app to open on my kindle , i had to uninstall it .
i find myself playing this until all i can see is dots ! i didnt think i would like it , but i really do !
i have a kindle fire an it would not work . the graphics were blurry an the noise was awful . deleted immediately .
this is an awesome game ! i found it while i was looking for something to do and now i am addicted ti this little game .

i am so glad this was an app of the day i like the advance search you have so many options i do n't know birds names and it was helpful
this is a great app for my family . we have fun watching the videos and listening to the music . i would certainly recommend this app for any family .
does n't run like it should ! only a few levels free . tried to download full version still would n't give me full version
love this app and my almost 3 year old can use to really good to see the videos that she want so to see .
this game is great for kids of all ages especially the older ones who say they have nothing to do . my kids and i enjoy this game a lot .
i found it to be a very challenging and fun game . some of the rooms are harder than others . i enjoyed it very much .
enjoyed this game a great deal . smooth play , good story , good hidden objects . no complaints , and yet again i feel i got more than my money 's worth on this one .

it gets a little boring at times . but , it 's fun to play sometimes . if you 're looking for a fast playing game , this is not the one to get .
this was the first game i put on the machine . i enjoyed playing and it took me a while to get through it . i went to another game like it but have n't like it at all .
i just found it really boring . not much to do , it was simple , boring , too simple , too boring . not challenging .
its boring and stupid . i hate it wat r th coins 4 and its hard 2 get past well far into th game
this game is okay . but it is not very user friendly . it could used better directions once you figure it out it is fun to play
if you are like me and like guess the product or brand you will like this one too ! ! ! a very fun game ! ! !
its . good but i rate it five stars because its good when it has more colors i will be very pleased .

hi this is a great app for drawing simpson 's and is a good deal for free . see you later guys
scrabble is my favorite board game and i am so happy to finally have it on my tablet . it is fairly easy to operate and enjoyable .
the eggs take too long to hatch and the amount of in-game coins that the items cost is too high .
wish y oh did n't have t o buy a upgrade to play the game . but i love it . great game .
its wonderful challenging each level . keeps your mind going . thanks . cant wait until i finish each level whats next . super
we have had this game for a long time and the 3 and 5 year old still enjoy it . i have n't bought the full version , but the free one works well .
great time playing . great hours of fun fun fun . a lot of fun times . great time playing . well worth the money .
not exactly like the original tetris i remember playing . it is fun , & challenging . it is a good time passer !
i deleted this app . after i downloaded it and opened it i saw that this was just not my kind of game .
fun game some of the later level start to get hard . but it makes you think lots of fun get it
i like this game . seems simple enough , and it is ; but it really is hard to figure some of these words out . i have enjoyed playing it .
i hate this app it is very hard to guess which one it is so ya anyways and i dislike this app alot .
so far it works good for me i just downloaded it so i would have it if i needed it .
i have this game loaded on all my devices ( 4 ) and i love playing it . i definitely recommend to everyone that likes this type of game
it works pretty much as i expect . it 's nice to have a favorites list , so i do n't have to find my channels again .
the pop up to rate this game has been coming up every few hands even if you click no thanks . it is annoying and if it continues i will delete this game .
fun and challenging all at the same time great time killer can lose track of time playing very easily ! have fun
its a chill game and easy to pick up a play . the system of control is a little weird at first but once you try it gets easier . works great on the galaxy s3 . enjoyable game !
this is great and i use this on my kindle and i love it very much not problem in the world with it
i love this game and played it every day , but recently it had gotten loading issues . tried uninstalling it and starting over but now ca n't get past the login screen . please fix the bugs .
the graphics suck considering the capabilities today and it is so repetitive it gets boring . i 'm probably going to delete it .
simple enough and pretty fun . it works perfectly fine on my kindle fire . i like it a lot and i 'm considering buying the full version .
easy to learn , fun to play . i would recommend this game . i have had hours of entertainment playing . only problem is figuring out how to use coins .
i love hidden object games , this one is a little different which is great i love it so far . please make more .
i like this game it is fun . i like the way it is set up . i would recommend it to anyone that likes word search games .
this is a fast moving game that keeps you thinking , it 's fun to see the difference in the levels and figure out how to defeat the boss , , i really enjoy it
not really my cup of tea . i like the traditional bingo games . i was fun for a short while but not a game i normally play .
i love that words with friends is now mobile for me . i played every day on my laptop and now can take wwf with me on my kindle .
this is a fun game . the levels get harder as you go and it works your brain . hope you get the game it is fun and enjoyable .
i love this game it is so cool ! it is very addicting ! whoever gets this game will have a better kindle , ipad , ipod , and whatever else they have . this game is so freakin awesome
i wear glasses and this app is great big numbers easy . to see and just as easy to use . thanks
i like this app a lot . i have downloaded many bingo games and they did n't work but this one does .
i was right into the game and then it said i had to buy the rest when on the app store it said it was free , bummer
this game is great ; the only thing that would make the app better is if you could make your own combinations of the three available opponents to change up the play order . otherwise , it 's excellent .
my daughter loves this game . i like that you can make it harder as you go along . it is also nice and colorful .
love it . but will it ever be over ? i do n't care if it ever is cause i can keep playing for now .
great app . level selection is very accurate . like the & quot ; angry birds & quot ; feel of the challenging mode . good for any age .
this game seems fun : ) i like that you are n't sucked into buying more points at the store . i like word games usually .
what is really the point of an alarm on your kindle ? i do n't know . between your alarm clock , phone and everything else . there is no need .
i like this one better because it tells you if it is a word or not . i like the hints to .
not really into video games but you get to fight and kill things . not looking towards . the spider thing but i think this game rocks so far
the game is fun and relaxing to play . it being a free app for my kindle fire is great too .
love this app ! totally addictive but i 've had trouble with it freezing more often than not on my kindle fire .
app will not open . keeps closing . frustrating if it opens u get half way through and it closes and you start all over and it does it again
could n't figure out how to make anything work other than the key which quickly became useless . nothing but a door . even had a hard time deleting it ,
this is a fun game not being free is kind of a bummer but the time u do get to play it is cool would love more free stuff thanks for the game good over all
it awesome it mostly modern music and that 's good cause that 's all i listen to lol also it not all guess the song you have to guess the artist to
this game is just like the old version . very easy game to play , like the different version that are available .
this game is filled with fun things . you have to try to earn acorns and coins to get animals . you also get blue stars when you get all of them you go on to the next level .
cute graphics but it is nowhere as smooth as temple run . it does n't respond to the finger swipe nearly as well , either . needs work .
this app is a good time killer and zombie simulator . i 've only had it for 2 hours and im addicted to it
if you would lower the price i might be willing to buy it and rate a little higher . only gave it as high as a two cuz i like the board game version
seems like a nice idea , but goes from too easy to too hard too quickly . just ends up being frustrating .
i 'm not sure why i got this app , but glad i did . it gives me something to entertain myself when i have time to kill .
this is a really neat radio app , you can chose from a lot of stations from all over the country .
i really want to get this app but im not allowed to get apps that are not free . other than that it sounds great !
i like that there is a variety of choice of sudoku games as well as different levels . i would recommend this .
i absolutely love this app . i play with all my friends and family . i recommend this app to everyone . it 's so much fun to play before i realize it it 's very late at night .
i love this game ! there 's always lots to do and the game play is easy to understand . need something to help pass the time ? this game is perfect ! ! !
i have played this for a while , and on the first levels it was addicting , but as you go into harder levels , it gets boring .
i love this game ! ! i bought the monkey to go with the bunny , and i loved the action packed adventures and the high flying adventures
i love this app and i love price even more ! it is by far the best app for browsing reddit .
my grandkids age 2 and 9 love this game . they have so much fun playing it . it is a favorite !
any game that lets you kill zombies with a car that is full of weapons is great for anyone of any age
this is really awesome and the best thing about it is where you can talk to people across the world and make new friends .
good vocabulary builder for growing kids . makes you really think about word associations . good for keeping the brain active on those boring days .
i love this app . it is something i use every night when i can not see the moon . had no problems or crashes so far .
ended up deleting the game because my daughter became bored very quickly with the game . she was able to get through level 1 but the second level was difficult and not very entertaining .
it is fun making your own village because you can design it the way you want it to look like
it keeps locking up . i have to reinstall to make it work . sorry i bought it . i am using a kindle fire .
not a good game boring lame easy stupid not for people over 10 but if u r then go and get it
it seems to work great . unfortunately , there is n't much of a selection of books that i would like to read or hear .
i think this is a game that young children would enjoy playing . it is simple enough for even a very young child .
fun app . fun to play . fun to play . fun to play . would be harder if it was not fun to play but it is fun to play . oh , it is fun .
see how well you can control the maze and not drop the ball . takes skill and speed to finish this game .
i was looking for something my 2 year old grandson could play . he loves it . i 'm if you have younger children they will like it also .
this is the best app i have purchased to date . i hope to get the hole files soon . i need wifi to upgrade .
very addictive and challenging game . i 've played it over and over again . i only wish there were more levels . lots of fun !
this is challenging and fun to play . some can be very difficult to figure out , while others seem to jump right out at you . i would recommend this game for enjoyment .
i really love these pic games some of them are easy but others are harder and really make you think to get the answers . fun for the entire family young and old .
love the many boards and variety of tile sets to chose from . my favorite of all the games available . plan to order more .
finally they have it for kindle i 've been waiting for it ... it works perfectly it 's not slow at all . i love it
yeah , this is okay , i was bored and downloaded it . it on some days is right on which i find very weird .
game is terrible . i wouldnt recomend to anyone over 10 years old . its controls are ok. the view is bad . the plot sucks . the only good thing is its free .
i love the game it is fun and i love fish so a double ya but all in all i love the game
i like this app . i can catch up on the news when i need to . the graphics are nice and the set up of reading the news is simple . download & amp ; have fun reading .
this game is brilliant ! challenging and beautiful in the hd . i wish i had known about it all along and look forward to many more rooms .
really only ten super easy levels i know its free and all but u can do better than that . i guess the game is okay but not wat i wat i was hoping for .
thought i would like this but cant get it figured out so dont go to pinterest very much . maybe will learn someday .
it is really a lot of fun , even the younger can play giving us the chance to play together challenging scores
this game is as much fun as candy crush . i think that i will like this game better . i have found that i am playing this game more then the other game .
i just got the game and i already got more than 200 coins added to 500 coins . this is a great game , overall .
objects was not very clear to find . that 's what made the game so great . you almost had to look at it from a distance .
i have played this game on paper for years . the only thing was that you had to download another app to play this app . after everything was downloaded the game was great .
i that it was just awesome with all of the guns you can shoot real guns . and it tells you
i love this game so much ! i find i am playing it more than others . this is the best game in the world ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
this is one of the best games i have ever played . it kind of feels like u r really on the titanic if u keep playing
this is a really fun game . it 's fast , but gives bonuses often , so you can play or a while before you run out of coins .
its ok but it takes too long to load at first but in the end its great little game buy i love all of the story games b/c they are all great .
the adds come after every single move and its annoying and . sometimes the only way to get out of it is to completely close out of the game..
this is a pretty fun game . it can be a little slow on getting the powerups . can take time to open the next episode .
fun game i like to draw so it is fun has lots of colors and little things to do on it .
i like the game but add multiplayer i have everything so could u get a update and a multiplayer as a new addition
this game is one of the best games i 've ever played on the kindle fire . it 's so fun ! people need this app .
use it all of the time . i used this every day to check out what is happening on face book
good game . some guy said that its not even like angry birds , so i guess its a good thing that its not . ( its should be it 's , sorry )
when your trying to aim it 's way to slow . i want it better . please fix this . i finally got this and that 's the problem . please fix .
its pretty fun but it gets boring waiting for the people to like draw something back . other than that it is an awesome game . i recommend to anyone who likes to draw ! ; )
this game is called link and it is lots of fun . i never played a similar game to this one so its original to me
i think this game is very good and very addictive wish some of these levels were a little easier to beat
i happen to find this game to be a refreshing , fun twist on the match 3 style of puzzle games .
it is fun to play , but does not give daily credits like most others . i play it once in a while , but not as often as i do others .
this is just a fun thing to do when you get tired of the games where you have to concentrate a little more . granddaughter loves it .
i play this game all the time and it actually helps me lose stress . i recommend it for all who like slot type games .
this game is amazing . i think that every one who can download this app , should . this is super fun app that allows . u to colorado and draw
the game is great and all but when i updated every time i tried to change levels it went straight back to a mother board . frustrating . but other wise great game .
this game os awsome this game is like a test and a memory game plus i give this game 5 star like movies
love the different choices . i have n't decided which i like the best . i just wish there was an undo button .
i love it ! i was disappointed that i couldnt get flappy bird because it looked so fun and cute ! but now they have this and i like it ! xd
this game is fun but the only real problem is the tools and weapons only come with ten hits then it dies .
it 's fun to play when you have a few minutes to spare . really easy to pick up just point and shoot .
its really addicting . ive been playing it for a few days now and i am fully addicted . i would be willing to pay $ 0.99 for an upgrade !
5stars when it works but i constantly have to uninstall and reinstall this game to see player turns . it even does n't work correctly on multiplayer on just this kindle fire .
was fun when i was a kid , but not so much any more . i guess it kind of let my old memories down .
this is my local news channel and with this app , i do n't have to turn on the television to know what 's going on in the world .
it 's ok but hard to work and see . i really need one i can print . probably works fine for others , just not for me .
i downloaded it for the camera aspect but it is very confusing and hard to use . waste of an app .
great game ! it is very challenging and keeps your interest for hours of fun . you have to download this game ! it is a keeper !
this game is lots of fun . i enjoy playing it when i have down time , or just when i have had dinner .
wanted a new game , i liked the game , but a little to expensive . i did like the graphic design .
the app works great but it asks to update frequently and then the update does n't process . otherwise very easy to use .
great game very addictive and you get lots of bonuses ... i love this game ! i have gotten a lot of friends hooked on this game ...
like the way you can change it up for a more challenging game . checkers is easy but it still makes our granddaughter plan her moves
great game ! i really enjoy playing it . but what would make it even better would be to have a relaxed mode so you can play the game without having to worry about a time limit .
i love to play this game . its fast its fun and its something to keep you busy when you have a few minutes . i wish there was different levels
great little town building sim with tons of quests and cool characters . social aspects and purchases are helpful but not intrusive . too addictive !
i have been getting this book for a while and was very happy to find an app for it on my phone .
i really enjoy playing the game but the ads are kind of a bother . they keep popping up after about every 5 games .
i really love this app . it works well with my phone . i have no problems with it , very easy to use and navigate
kids love it and i love that they are learning while playing it . actual game , not just puzzles like most kids apps for kindle
i love that i can track the progress i go . i feel like it helps me to really focus , awesome !
i have n't played it but my 9 yr old daughter and my 7 yr old son seem to like it a lot . if they 're happy , i 'm happy .
it 's okay i just wish it would connect with facebook so i can get full access to stuff . on kindle fire when you try to connect to facebook the screen just goes blank .
i really enjoyed this game . i played it on a droid razr . it probably would have been easier on a bigger screen , but i was able to find everything and beat the game .
hours of fun and lots of searching on the internet good to be able to reset and then earn more clues the next time
it 's an ok app i mean you can view all your pics and follow people and stuff but yo have to pay to actually post things so it 's ok
stupid but worth my time when i am bored . but just to let u guys know yes it is random results
this game is great ! a new spin on tetris with fun power ups and time challenges ! i love it ! i would recommend it to any tetris player !
if the game maybe explained things better or dates out with more tips it would be easier but i will get it eventually .
fun game to keep your mind thinking . makes you really remember some logos from your childhood . my husband and i enjoyed seeing who could get it first .
this is one awesome game i love to play it it must be one of the most addicting games in the amazon appstore
starts out easy , but gets more difficult . my advice is save your coins . it is a good way to spend time waiting at dr. offices .
great game and a lot of fun to play . it takes time to build up money and diamonds but it 's worth it in the end . i say buy it .
the graphics were ok but the game was hard as it was really hard to control your pool stick . fix that problem and that could improve this game a lot .
my computer was down and i was missing my words with friends . this helped fill my down time and i enjoyed being able to play .
i love this app i think it is the best game like ever and i do n't say that about any game
did n't care much for the task killing portion . but found the quick glance at what could move to the sd card handy . until i found another app built just for that .
really helps with the pictures on my kindlefire . its easy to use and really helps bring the best out of the pictures you take
such a great game ! i 've downloaded all of them , and i might be a little addicted ... but it 's fun ! i keep getting stuck though . i 'd recommend it to anyone !
i love it . it has lots of levels and different types of challenges with so either so many moves or being timed .
hate to be forced to write a review in order to play . would prefer to pay and get rid of ads . game is awesome though
really fun . ok story and ok graphics . lol lol lol lol lol lol lol lol lol lol lol lol lol
i like the game but i have been doing level 24 for two weeks and it is doing my head in
i do n't understand the game , but my 8 yr old daughter loves it . i am happy as long as she is happy .
love this game . however when i updated this app i lost all my points , levels etc . and i do not like the new format .
you need to get the full game in order to play , you get three hands with the free game , the game cost 0.99
the dinosaur day game is a little boring you just touch dinosaur and the dinosaurs do a move but it would be a good game for toddlers .
this is a fun game . keeps my daughter interested and happy when we are waiting but i wish she was able to play for longer periods of time
this app is sooo cute . if you love animals then you should get this app . the pictures are so cute . : )
love my angry birds no matter what it 's called . each game adds a new challenge to it . if you like angry birds , you love this .
great game ! awesome graphics and wonderful support . beware very addictive ! one of the best slots on amazon and easy to play , hours of great entertainment . you definitely should give this game a try = )
i did care for this game . i wish they would they made it better . get more credits . then it be better .
if dev can add zombies this will be the greatest game ever . as it is , replay value is limited as mentioned by others
great great great game and i love it you can get it for free i will play it a lot : o
this is a very fun app . it is an excellent way to learn new words and get better at spelling and definitions
the best version of the game . i 've looked for a good version and i finally found a good one . thx for the game
it is a good app but i should be able to save my designs like i said it is a good but not great
this is a fun app for all ages . my husband and i play it all the time and then play it back to see out work . fun !
i like to play this to help pass time when i am bored or just feel like i need something to do to keep my hands busy !
i love mahjong and hope to have many hours of entertainment with it . i am impressed that it comes with a story .
this is so awesome that the kids i baby sit love it so much that i go home with a dead battery on my kindle
this game soo much fun it is super addictive so you should get this game really badly . get it now
it gives me something to do to pass the time . it does n't require any thinking , which is sometimes a good thing . but we all need something to exercise our brains .
did n't like the idea that you can only download music but can burn it using it on your kindle , use to using this product on a desk top .
it 's ok. played it but it had too much things to do and being a busy mom did n't have the time to work on it so i deleted it .
why why must i get it they made me right this review its stupid the game is also it tells u what to do dont buy it
i did not like this app . i uninstalled it . there were too many ads . it was not easy to install either .
i really enjoyed working through all of the levels . it is a treat time management game . ca n't wait for airport mania 3 !
i did n't like this game that much . it was very hard to control and the plane went out of control very easily . do n't get this app ...
nice game really helps on long road trips addicting and free . this is one of those games that i love
it is a fun game with some challenges , but it is a nice and awesome game to play with your friends and family
i just love this game . the graphics are just awesome . i have already got several bingos and i am just on level 3. best of all it is a free app .
its fun just wish had more energy . it would be nice that instead of using a full energy only a half .
i is awesome ! before i got this i didnt like horses but no i think there cute ! download now ! it is so awesomely awesome
you only get 3 articles a day , but there is a wide variety of articles to chose from . i think this is basically fair for free .
i have been playing this game all day and love it . very easy to master and an excellent time killer . works great on nook color .
could be more challenging . only on level 20 so maybe . not sure how many levels there are . that is all .
i love playing it . just has too many ads popping in on us . my husband and i play it with our friends all the time its hard to put it down .
well , this app is just wonderful . i use it on my galaxy tab and it works perfectly . the ui is very nice , meaning it works great on my tablet . keep up the great work .
wonderful music for the season ! i am so glad you offered it to me free ! ! i would have bought it anyway though . thank you for the christmas bonus !
my 7 year old daughter loves this game - it really keeps her attention and she enjoys playing it on the kindle fire hd .
this was not want i thought it was going to be . but it is a lot of fun if you like hidden objects .
this is one of the best games i have played in my life but they should add more costumes in the game
i absolutely love this game . i recommend this game to everyone who enjoys word puzzles . the puzzles are really fun to play they also have a daily puzzle .
nice app i would recommend to all kids who like angry birds and temple run very similar concept and a very nice non violent game for kids & all kids that love angry birds would like this
i love this app it gives me and my friends idea 's what to do with our nails best app on the planet
this game is terrible i would not tell you to get . when you first get it you cant do nothing
this app is great it is really fun . it 's a good app . i think you should get it . it 's really fun .
this is a very good app it is a little addicting but its fun it could use a little of updating with the movies
i love this game . it is so so so addicting ! its challenging which is what makes it fun . i even like that they put their own logo as a question .
the burn the hole mini game is very difficult and there is no skip option and i had to delete the game because it was too difficult . otherwise i love that it is n't a short app .
i. did n't like the game . each pass with the arrow took forever to take an action . i usually end up buying the game apps i try but not this one .
i have enjoyed this game . i have beat all my friends . i am an angry birds fan and ca n't seem to quit .
great game ! i like being able to play at my own pace ! recommend this game to anyone who likes word games ! the characters are great as well !
not much fun to play on the kindle fire , at least not for me . maybe the paying version would be better , but this one kept freezing up so i deleted it .
this app was not very exciting but it was a time filler for the holiday . would not have paid for it .
very good turn my kindle fire hd into more then i could ever hope for need a good shot i now got the camera .
i use this app regularly and would recommend it to anyone . i use it on my phone and my kindle fire .
does n't work do n't buy it . i hate it . you wo n't like it . it 's not what you want to get . it is not the same
i love having a place to keep all my favorite things so i can go back and find them again .
one of the better bingo games . cute graphics & amp ; the payouts are fairly often . highly recommend if you 're looking for a laid back game of bingo .
my grandson got this and seems to like being able to follow his favorite sports teams . he is almost 11 years old so it must be an easy program to use ! !
this is awesome ! it is the best makeup and hair app i ever played , i have no idea why people hate it , i highly recommend it for all girls !
this game is quite frustrating at times -- and yet i ca n't stop playing it ! it 's got my husband and 10 year old hooked as well !
all the interaction that comes with the story is great and they keep adding more and more stories .
love this game . it is so much fun and fast paced . even got my husband hooked on it .
i loved this game . it has lots of different levels so the adventure never ends . i play it all the time . some of them are quite hard but it 's a lot of fun .
its like you have a real horse . its very creative and interesting . it has decent graphics i was very surprised . it is very addictive and entertaining
one of my favorite games to play on my on my kindle fire . glad i was able to get this game . love it ! ! ! !
login page is very slow . most games are so slow they are unplayable .
again i have to play the same games over and over . makes me not want to play it often . i expected a better game .
it 's good , and it is almost exactly like flappy bird , so i recommend it to anyone who likes that game .
started playing last night and had to make myself stop to go to bed ! ! ! ca n't wait to start again tonight ! ! !
the game is easy to navigate and comes up with words i have to look up ; ( it 's fun to have while waiting and for just a break .
so i push the coins off the edge , what a thrill , do not waste your time , i am sorry i did .
i love this game . daily bonuses , gifts ... i can play this one for hours . all of my favorite slot games are on here .
i found this game interesting . it is a great time filler . each level is challenging and fun to play . it is a great time filler for the doctors office .
i didnt really use this app . i only played with it for a little bit after i got my kindle fire .
would be better if the letters were a tad larger . found that the game would not respond on occasion . was no way to complete the game because of this .
this app is everything that you would need provided you just wanted to do the simple things like transfer some money or check your balance .
i tried this one and was n't impressed . ads and constant updates made me remove it quickly . i will wait for something better .
yes finally this game is free ! ! i have been wanting this game for sooooo long and now it is free , get it and you wo n't regret it
this game is another fun dash game i really enjoyed it . kind of repetitive but it was enjoyable as well .
it even poops ! ! ! ! i have flappy birds on my galaxy s3 but i think this one is better ! ! that it works on my 1st generation kindle fire makes it even better .
this is just as involved and complicated as the crush , , great graphic lay outs . love the fact u can use zen mode to work on puzzles and relax or not .
this game is fun for all ages . even elementary school children can enjoy it , but it is challenging enough for adults as well .
great crossword puzzle . love it would recommend . this puzzle to any one . try it out . hope you enjoy it too .
it 's a cool app but do any of u guys know how to update this or mine craft on the kindle
recipes are easy and the way they are shown are excellent to use . i would recommend this magazine even to a novice
i do n't get this game at all could someone in the next reveiw and tell me how to play . thanks : )
this game is super fun -- i love it ! ! considering it is a free game , its pretty dang good ! love the graphics too ! all around great !
you can spend hours playing this game and for those who spend time alone it really helps keep your mind sharp !
this is just as good as the apple aquarium and i like playing it more . more options and cheaper to maintain . this is more fun .
i love playing this game . my son loves zombies and he likes this game also and i play it every day
my wife loves solitaire and this is her app . i was told it is fun to play by her . i should had let her write this .
i love this game ! ! its so cute and addicting ! ! ! i 'm not into scary zombie games , this is fun to play and kid friendly
i 'm enjoying playing this game ... not the same as vegas , but still fun . you can turn sound off if needed & amp ; there does n't have to cost a single penny !
match 3 games are never ending keeps my mind sound and active . the many levels keeps me surprised and entertained
i enjoy this game very much that i do n't forget to play it every chance i can . it is very challenging . and interesting . once you start it you wont be able to put it down .
i like this game i just wish it took up less space but you also have to be patient to wait for items to be built .
story line was a little boring . the characters were dull . the one thing that i liked was the graphics . nice detail and background .
i love to play mahjong and i thought this might me fun , but i do n't like it as well as i like other mahjong games .
sort of brings back memories of childhood . played this in school during quiet time . this is a great app for kids . good for keeping them occupied on long trips or in waiting rooms .
this is cool but i have n't played minecraft so i do n't know these things ... ... . they are creepy i want them to make a robot one
hidden object , matching 3 or more , and a storyline , although very fantasy based , makes for a lot of fun . collecting resources to build too .
this is exactly what i like update news when i want it watch this app while i watch something else
this game is such a great way to pass time . and it it too fun to put down ! i suggest it to all my tablet friends .
this latest installment is great . the different sections of the store are so involved it really takes the game to a new level . my absolute favorite game thus far .
great game you get to actually create your own house . the only set back is the tasks and the amount of time it takes to get the item you purchased . but overall this game is great .
it was easy to download and has been easy to play . the only thing that i have n't liked is when i exit out my play is n't always saved where i left it .
absolutely just love this game worth every bit . just try it and you will love it too . prizes or great .
i do not like it one bit it is so so so so bad ! ! ! ! you better fix it or kids will hats you
love it ... much easier to use for me than regular twitter and on my fire kindle its great . i would highly recommend .
love this game ... wish it would give more coins like other games but other than that excellent game ... play all the time !
i enjoy the action pack , the flying and shooting , i have lots of fun and when i get better at it i will buy the upgrade .
this is one of my most used apps . where ever i am i just hit it and i know exactly what is going on as far as the radar . would never be without it .
love this game best bingo by far . never have any problems never freezes like other bingos . i really do recommend this game .
i deleted the game because it was not what i expected of slot games . i am unable to remember if after time playing , it required that i purchase points .
this game is fun for a free game . it does take awhile to regenerate grabs but you do n't have to pay for them unless you are too impatient .
its a lot of fun . its hard after a while . i really want the other version . for now download the free one : ) .
funny . clever . worth the price ( free ) . ca n't get laughs any cheaper than this . did i mention it was unique ? play it .
it is very handy to have the facebook app . you can quickly check notifications and chat with friends without having to waste time finding the site .
this app would only allow me to go to a certain number if elements and then it would erase everything ... my advice ; do not get this app ! ! ! ! !
i love this game it 's a little bit hard but mostly easy . great for kids older than 8 years old
this game sucks ! i thought i liked it but it was a piece of junk minecraft pe is far superior and also survival craft rocks too . both of those games can kick block story 's but !
it is a great game for puzzle lover 's . i loved the first game in the series and am excited to see a second game !
kids love it . very simple book to move around in and to read regularly will buy more soon . thank you .
good game i just wish my kindle would connect to facebook through it . the price is a buck but it 's free on the phone wish it was the same
this app is a lot of fun and i enjoy the questions ! this game tests your knowledge and i love to watch the movie again and try to do better on the quizzes .
think again ... loads of fun but not so easy . very cool to play and you do get some help if you ca n't figure it out .
i could not complete floors without the guide and i do n't care for games that i can not figure out on my own . i became frustrated over and over again . not my cup of tea .
i love this app my whole family loves it too it is fun if is cool too i get to play air hockey : )
this game will keep you entertained for hours . i am not much of a gamer , but i love this game . it is fun and challenging .
it 's a fun game , not hard to learn and easy to remember the tips . definitely would recommend for anyone especially kids .
love how i can change all of my apps to make it a default app for if i want to automatically start it !
this game is awesome ! ! ! ! it has a lot of logos and some of them are hard to find out , but others are way easier ! : )
this is more my hubby 's game and i have to steal my kindle back when he is not looking , so i know he loves it . he does not want to put it down
i like to challenge my mind and this is certainly a good way to do it . i have n't played the timed games yet , but will in the near future .
love this game , plays great on my kindle fire 2nd generation . different than some match 3 games that i have played .
so far , so good . just started playing this game but i like it so far . graphics are crisp looking . i love escape games
i like bejeweled blitz the best , but this game is also fun and has some challenges . there are different levels and some are more interesting than others so i would give it a try .
i love mahjong but this was awful . i wanted to play a 3d version of game , but the controls just did not respond on the kindle .
this is a really great little game to pass the time . has some pretty good graphics as well . like all the weapons and such .
i really liked this , but then it just stopped working on my kindle . i did all the tricks just would n't work . i use yahoo know and it works great .
it is like the bad version of mine craft . you ca n't even save your world . i have no good words to say .
i never get bored with this app . i play with friends and people i 've never met . after playing with people better at it than me , i have gotten much better too ! love this app !
awesome game ! ! i enjoy playing all the time . graphics are good for this type of game . give it a try !
it seems to be a kid version of flow . it 's not much different , so i uninstalled it . not bad if free .
this calculator app is great and its very helpful for everything i need it for ! ! you should really get it ! !
not a real user of facebook so i can not really rate the application it gets and brings up page quickly
you know when you have that moment when someone says `` whatever you want '' , or the `` i do n't know '' just let this handy app decide for you . fantastic !
i play this all the time . so much fun and easy to use for the first time . love this app .
i run through the available words too fast and it does n't have levels to progress through . each word is one level . there may be more than 100 levels , but that only means 100 words .
i really enjoy playing this game . for this being a free game i am really impressed ! lots of fun ... well worth the download .
i use this on my kindle and like the card action . i waste a lot of time with this but enjoy it very much !
keeps me entertained . so far its really easy ... ..but based on other reviews it should get more difficult . excited to get to the more challenging levels .
i had this on my ipod and now i have it much bigger on my kindle fire ! its my favorite app and would recommend it to anyone who loves fun apps
this game has totally awesome graphics and story line . i just finished playing and i ca n't wait to play number two . keep these cool games coming please .
when i seen it i said its fake but i seen the reviews and it was about clothes and that was what i wanted now i can get the coolest stuff ever
this app is really fun and it is challenging . my friends and i just love to play together . i recommend it .
the product is fine . i do n't have a problem with it . the improvements that were made are good and it looks great .
this is pretty cute and nice for little kids ! i think the little ones will enjoy it ! ! so yeah ... .it has a few glitches though
all you do is wait around to feed the baby . it does n't need changing , playing with or have wants . very boring .
i have since deleted this application . not because i did not like it , i did , but because i have too many apps and not enough space on my tablet .
i am playing with my 9 year old granddaughter and it is a great way to stay in touch . this is for 2 people not one , so get a drawing partner !
this is a fun game that my three year old grandson taught me . unfortunately , he 's much better at it than his grandma !
if you like dragonvale you will love this game . it 's kinda like dragonvale and dragon city put together . it 's a game you will not want to stop once you start playing .
i love this game the graphics on it are amazing ! i 'm not that good at the game , but it 's still awesome . i highly recommend this game to anyone .
this game is a good game , very easy to play . i play this game just about every day . i like it .
this is a wonderful app . i just love old movies . i have a older kindle fire hd and it runs good . it 's also refreshing that it actually had direct tv as a provider .
really enjoy this app . like the way the tiles change from puzzle to puzzle , makes you pay close attention and not become boring .
could be more current . expected breaking news but most news is more to the old side . a little disappointed in the app
is fine but you only get a limited number of puzzles and then if you want more you have to pay cash , so i did the free ones and deleted it .
be warned things take for ever like wen you buy a monster it takes for ever to hatch bit otherwise is ok
most enjoyable lack of frustration within an app yet ... pleasant graphics and music ... fun ... fun ... fun ... just the right level of challenge to be rewarding ...
i really enjoy this game . it is challenging but fun . i enjoy the graphics as well as the pace of the game . i love the way it looks on my kindle . no issues .
i find the associations very challenging which help me to keep my mind sharp . my mom turned me on to this . she is much better than i am so i am working hard to improve : )
i actually really enjoyed this game . very easy to get used to the game play . but complex enough to make it challenging with being frustrating . love it !
too hard , i am dissapointed with the game overall . i would pick another type of game over this one . i bought it with coins , so i am really not out anything .
just started playing and i 'm already addicted . lots of variation on some familiar games but this time they are all in one game
love , love , love this game . it is so addictive i ca n't put it down ! anyone who loves puzzle games will enjoy this one .
i got this app for my kindle and really like it and is easy to use . i would recommend it .
i play this game every day . it is one of the best bingo games out there . and you get credits every 4 hours . this free game really is free !
this game is very fun to play if it ends up working for you . i like it and it 's definitely not a waste of time .
graphics are better than ever . no ads . i love killing monkeys ! this is the best angry birds so far . i am having so much fun playing it . evo user .
this game works just fine . other than a few pop up ads ( which are common for free games ) it works just fine !
i have found it to be a fun , pass the time game . the mini games are my favorite . like others have said , its sort of like farmville , but with a twist .
this game is so fun . i love it but it kind of reminds me of pokemon . i still like it though . i love games like this . cant wait to keep playing it ! ! ! !
great fun for one and even more with friends ! can be habit forming what with the bright graphics and sound effects ! lots of fun for one and all !
this game is really fast paced and really addictive ! its challenging but in a great way and it could keep you entertained for hours ! the graphics are great and super cute ! recommended for all ages : )
it will get compared to angry birds but is different enough to be a completely different experience . definitely a lot of fun .
i enjoy this game . it keeps the mind working and makes you think outside of the box . however it does become addictive .
i like puzzles so i like this app . it passes the time . but like many apps , if you want more puzzles , then you will have to upgrade .
i hate this game . its just like the first only worse i cant belive that u had to pay for it . totally a huge rip of ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ' !
i 'm a fan of these types of games but this one was just ok to me . i did n't get into it as much as i hoped .
it looks like a fun game . but dont read those please . you have to play it first to see if you like it or not . so please play this game .
super super super super super supper super game play for anger issues hay did you find the mistake yet ? yeah you found it did n't you
this app works perfectly for me everytime . i have no complaints whatsoever . if you have netflix and a kindle fire this app is great in my opinion .
i love love love this game and am glad it 's finally available for my kindle . it can become addictive , enjoy and have fun ! ! !
this game is fun but i had to get rid of a lot of my games i already have and it takes a long time to download but it was worth it for the fun battles
fun game loads fast on my htc thunderbolt .. hope they come out with more levels keep up the great job
does n't work for the new update . when you try to tap inventory then it says it has stopped . please fix .
i thought this game would be fun by it was very very bad it was boring i hats this game
farkle is a fun fast moving game so you can play a game or two any time you have a few spare minutes .
for free this is a great game , but limited number of puzzles is kind of disappointing . some of the puzzles made little sense , but again , it 's free .
awesome game i would recommend this game and the graphics are awesome and the hidden objects are great and you will not put the game down until you finish it .
i am trying to get faster , it is a fast game . fun to challenge yourself , and i do . moves around real nice and allows you to get at ones you may have thought were hidden .
i love all the mahjong games . it keeps my eyes and my mind sharp while allowing me to enjoy my time away from work .
do you have a few seconds to waste while you 're on hold ? or maybe in line at the bank ? this is just the game its quick and easy .
my 8 year old and her friends have fun with this , but it 's really designed for younger kids . i 'm not deleting it , just because it is colorful and something different to keep around .
i like this game . it starts you put with basically free hints , making it a little easier to continue on with the levels . a more fair game .
i enjoy this game by myself but even more with my 6 year old grand daughter . it can be enjoyed at any age .
boring game , hard to control , puzzles can be a good challenge , but i want to have fun , not frustration . got it for free and uninstalled it . usually a fan of puzzle games .
this game looks like a great game and it deserves 4 stars or 5 stars . plus it looks like a 4 to 5 star game !
i think this game is fun and cute . if u do n't have a pet like me this game will be for u or anyone just get the fun game
the most amazing app ever . the whole family really enjoys all the great movies that we can watch over and over . highly recommend getting this app .
this game is sooooo fun and additive ! if you get it today it 's free if you do n't it is worth the dollar !
this game is entertaining and interesting for those of us who enjoy brain games . i think that it would be suitable for anyone . i have enjoyed playing it .
this game is a lot of fun to play . some levels can be very challenging as well which is a great workout for your brain . enjoy !
it is so fun i have had my kindle for 2 years it was one of my first ever app i still love it i can play it for hours ! ! ! ! ! ! !
i really like this slot game . the graphics are good looking and the winning is fun ! the progress of getting new levels goes fairly fast i think everyone would enjoy these games .
ok , i like fast food so this is a fun game just to see how many logos i remember . i enjoy playing it when i have some spare time .
so much better than # 3 better graphics , faster , easier cheaper power ups , fun fun fun ! love playing this , getting more lives makes playing better .
i love this game this game is amazing its a blast omg really you should try it its fun . plz try . and review
i enjoyed this game quite a lot . the graphics are good for the hidden object and the adventure mystery was a challenge . highly recommend .
ca n't download any songs at all . it 's all a lie . literally one minute of me downloading it i deleted it . can only download music they want you to . lame
this is a very addictive game loads of fun and time consuming i hope you will enjoy this as much as i have
it 's a cool game but it keeps freezing and i 'm not very happy that for it the work again ( for a period of time ) i have to down load it again .
saw this game on facebook and decided to give it s try , i love it makes you think and its fun
this app ( game ) is awesome ! i also told my friend to download it . i have to say it again : it is awesome .
this is an awesome game . my nine year old son enjoys this game so much . even my wife and daughter plays it . keep up the good work glu .
this is the best game ever ! ! ! ! ! it is so fun i ca n't stop playing it ! ! ! i 'm so addicted i was up all night last night playing it ! ! !
amazing game . the graphics are great and the game play is freaking stunning . this game might not be for younger ages but anyone else you 'll have as much fun as i have
now i do n't mind a challenge . in fact , i love them . the problem is that it is just plain out stupid .
i love to play this game . i was first introduced to this game on facebook , and am excited now that it is on my kindle .
most have app . i use this when traveling and love the way of wakes you up in the morning . it does n't scare the hell out of you in the am .
this is an interesting story but the action is not very intuitive . there does seem to be a lot of back and forth as well .
if you like pool this app is for you . takes time to learn controls but is worth it . even my 4 yo has learned to play it .
i got this game as a free app of the day and i love it ! if i would have known how much fun it is , i would have bought it a long time ago !
love this bingo game . easy to play . win quite a bit ... .not frustrating just lots of fun . and it is free ! !
ordered this app for my kindle . this app does what all the reviews says . this is a must have app for any kindle . very pleased with it .
great game ! i have beaten the game and playing all the levels again . best free app of the day but i would pay $ 4.99 .
this is a fun challenging game . fun for the entire family . hours of fun , great for game night , or teams .
the shooting controls are n't all that good . it 's also obvious the people who made this game do n't know jack about guns
rooms are simple , yet very detailed . graphics are great . i have never played a game like this before . definitely worth your time .
it was fine at first , but then while it explained everything it got kind of hard to follow and as a result i got very confused and died alot . i wish they could slow down the instructions
downloaded this game because i love the nintendo ds games brain age and brain age two . this is nothing like them and i only played it a few times before i deleted it .
i decided to put it on my kindle . i am not sure if i will use it .
this one is as good as the first one i have love the adventure while finding the tiles with this
it is a game you have fun playing . you keep going back to this game . this game make you us your mind . you can not wait to see what the next step will bring .
no bad it did the job is a little bit hard to solve maybe good for those genius out there .
omg this game works so great on the kindle fire i can play it for hours and still have fun if u have a kindle fire i suggest that you get this game ! ! ! ! ! ! !
this game is really fun and all but the controls are very poor . i think they can do better . otherwise its fun
it 's fun , easy , and the graphics are sooo adorable . i wish i had some friends playing with me ... thanks for making a great , relaxing game : )
it 's not a major challenge . good for kids , but not any sort of challenge for adults . i 'll keep for now .
having christian music on the go is awesome to me because the local station we have does n't always come in very clear so when that happens i have my phone and this app ready to go .
very great app . i really like it . its one of the best apps . it is worth the dollar and it is very addictive .
would rather have a game that you play against the computer and can replay each hand , not interested in playing on line with other players
this was downloaded by my daughter . i do n't play with it . because of this i really can not give a rating of it .
fun bingo game . moves much faster than the other bingo apps so a bit more challenging . i play for hours !
pay outs are good , daily bonus . chances to level up are good and does n't take forever . good deals on coins .
grand kids love it , they know the characters and like to interact with the situations the characters get into . cool !
very cool game . reminds a ton of theme park , an old pc game i used to play back in the day . give it a try !
love the way i can download songs and their lyrics so i can sign along .i guess we 're never to old to learn .
this thing can talk , but it says stupid and the f word and other inappropriate language and it actually tells you to say the word ! this is bad for kids , do n't download .
this was very fun , tricky sometimes with the picture clues , but other than that it is a fun game . recommend it
i like this game alot ! ! sometimes i wish i had more time but then it would be to easy . great game .
some of the picture seem to have nothing to do with the words , but it is a fun game . just maybe give us some better clues .
i wanted this game when it came out but then i saw that it said 3.99 so i just used my money to get the game and it was worth it .
this is good give 's a lot of joy and is easy to use even my husband can use it and that must be good .
great game . lots of options . easy to start hard to master . recommend highly . good for all ages . challenging enough to keep you interested but not too hard to enjoy .
a game that is free should be free . you should not have to buy it after so many levels . the game was a lot of .
amazing and it works i love it def on it like all the time . u should def get if changes lives people
when i get on my kindle i do n't even tap on the link it just goes straight to it . it 's taking over my kindle i can barely play any other game .
a fun way to pass time and challenge your mind ! a good game for all levels ! spider solitaire is a winner !
text plus is really a great app and its just a bonus that it free . i really suggest that you try this app . i recommend it to everyone .
this game is the best . i was able to do all the levels . spend 99 cents on this game , it 's worth it .
i think you should play fruit ninja it is a very good game.i love how there are all kinds of different fruits like one i have never even heard of !
this is just an okay game . it gets repetitive real quick , but good time waster in the doctors waiting room . glad it free , because i would n't pay for it .
have n't had a lot of chances to use this yet but when i have it 's been fine .
it doesnt show anything but your balance . i gave 3 stars because i like chase online but not on kindle fire it only shows your balance .
i did not download this game , my kids did , but if i let them , they will play it for hours .
i liked this enough to buy the pro version . i recommend this to anyone who likes bowling and/or shuffle board .
not much of a selection even for a free app . do like that at the end of the game it directly asks if you want to play again .
this . game is fun . i enjoy games like this . if you like dress up games you will like this . it is fun for people of all ages !
this is a pretty cool game , the effects are great , ca n't wait to be able to buy another horse and enter bigger competitions .
i was looking for more of a beginner set . i am keeping this app for my older grandchildren , they are loving it , both boy and girl .
fun puzzle game , great to play in short breaks , gives you something to think about which i like , good game
this game is nice and fun to play on occasion . everything takes too long to build . that 's my only problem with the game so far .
my nine year old grandson recommended the game to me . it is fun , but i do n't have everything figured out yet . there should be directions somewhere .
this is a really cool game . i love it because i love movies , but it can be a little challenging sometimes . overall , it 's a great game so everybody go download it now ! ! we
i deleted another solitaire app because it had single ads . this app has the same ads . that is very disappointing .
there once was a clock app as the free app of the day but now there 's this thing in it 's place . funny .
i chose this because this is a hard game and it is free and it is not a really good game .
great very cute character it also has a choice of controls so you can pick which is best for you and a fun challenge based story line yeah
love this game . it is so addicting that you will lose track of time . i would recommend it for anyone doing & # 34 ; brain training & # 34 ; .
the only thing that keeps this from 5 stars is the ads . but the ads are minor and the game is everything you want .
i downloaded it since i have no games on my kindle fire and figured it would be easy but there are a bunch of characters i do n't even know
i absolutely adore this app ! easy and totally fun . my six year old sister and i ca n't get enough of it . we 're addicted
mini quest is a basic rpg in which you have to complete tasks and run through various levels . its a good way to waste the time !
this so much fun . it is easy to play and very addictive . all the prizes and coins and the upgrades wow
what 's not to like ? if you use yahoo , you need this app . i have it on my kindle and my android . i use it daily .
just too good ... love playing it ... just go nd get this app . its good for any age group ... its even a good eye exercise .
awesome ! perfect ! exactly what i was looking for : ) perfect for lists and anything else you can think of . sharing with friends is easy to do too . love love love love love
did not work smooth , lost almost always , and you have to buy in to continue . sorry but it was designed in the houses favor .
i think it 's awesome , but it would be hard for little kids . even i have trouble sometimes ! wish you could skip a level , and hints were cheaper . but overall a great game .
love this silly little game ! just a way to pass the time . i wish you could store up more grabs so i dont have to wait for the timer .
it is a good application and i am glad to have it on my kindle . i would pay for it .
this game is great . it 's a lot of waiting but it 's worth it to destroy everyone lol . dark but pretty amusing when you 're bored !
i love this game ! it us addictive and cool . you will really like it . but ; sometimes the app goes really slow .
really good game of checkers . you can start off by playing easy games up to games that are very difficult .
ran out of credits , was fun till that happen , would love a game you can play and not go on facebook or run out of credits
i do n't like that after 14 plays you have to pay for it . they said it was free , but it is not
its fun but you cant interact with the animals that you buy so if you like farm story then you love it
i had none of the issues others did with steering . it works very well for me , and this is one of my favorite games now .
i liked the puzzles of the game i hope that the next episode is a little more challenging though . i will download the next episode to see .
in my opinion i think that the game 4 pics 1 word was ok but there were sometimes when there were major brain teaser s and i could n't figure it out .
my son loved it and played it often so we purchased it and he still plays it at least twice a week .
i just bought the full version . i 'm writing this review because it asked me every 2 minutes . that 's why the 4 stars .
this game can be lots of fun and very frustrating . have to keep your eyes on the stars ! i enjoy playing this ! !
this game stinks ! no part of it is fun and it is entirely based on luck . not worth coming up with the extra words required for review .
it is good game , but too short . i hope it does n't take too long for their to be new rooms added .
granddaughter was allowed to purchase this on her kindle and is really enjoying it . i find all kindle apps to be both fun and educational in one way or another .
it is like temple run and jetpack joyride put together one of the best games ever and a must get for people of all ages .
i love to play hearts it is very challenging , it is just a good past time , i would recommend it to everyone ! !
once you begin you have to keep going to see how high you can go to the very next level .
you have played angry bird then the same fits . i mean how else can you do the same thing but different names
it was a pretty fun game ! very relaxing for a game ! not to hard ! it can be for any age !
this is the best ever . i could play this game all day if had enough coins . i would recommend this game to everyone to play . , thanks
this game is awesome i can play this game all day long if my mother would let me it is harder when you go farther into the game
can play with or without spending real $ $ . fun additive game . very cute . i experienced very few problems with this app .
i enjoy this game more then candy crush and i do n't feel i need to spend money to advance levels . it 's an option not needed .
love the board game as a kid and it helps your spelling get better is you stink at that . happy the app is available . the extras are my favourite cause they give you an extra challenge .
its a fun game it takes a little bit to get the hang of it but its a lot if fun .
this is a great game that the entire family will enjoy . i like the way it gets more and more challenging with each new level .
fun to play , if you have steady control of your hands . tilting the tablet to play is challenging if you do n't .
i love seeing twitter in such a great app ! i love on my kindle fire how on the app the bird looks so clean !
did n't work on my kindle fire . my signal stayed the same , but try it . it might work for others idk
had to rate for free hint so here you go . i 'm not very far in and already stuck ... i need to do more brain exercises .
it is a great game and makes your brain think by making connections . it is an awesome game for all ages . buy this !
i love word searches and this works great while waiting in doctor offices , late at night when i ca n't sleep i can play this on my galaxy tablet and not have to turn a light on .
fun to play ! medium level difficulty ! more enjoyment than challenge ! lots of fun to use on my new kindle fire hd !
very addictive . sorry to say when i got to level 14 the game reset itself & amp ; i had to start all over again . so disappointing .
i have the original kindle fire which may be the problem - but my wwf games wo n't update ! used to be great but not the last week or so !
i know they try to put the 5 star ones first but honestly it sucks . its harder than flappy birds and i cant get the bird to stay the same color !
7 little words is an excellent game for those of us who love word games ! i am so glad i found 7 little words .
love playing this game . it is quite addictive though so i set aside an amount of time i want to play each day and that has worked well for me .
it 's a good game except that it takes to long for your energy to grow back so you can continue playing
very fun but also very challenging . only on level teen but it seems like i am already addicted to it .
i love this game , it makes me feel better about how they closed flappy birds on the appstore . this game is great if you dont have wifi . you should get it .
the game is really fun me and my brother enjoy it a lot i 'm really glad that i got this game
i love this app ! ! ! ! some of it is funny some of it is weird and some just do n't make any sense at all
very different then most games out there and some of the levels are a lot more challenging then i thought they would be .
would like a version i can play without being hooked to the internet . but it 's fun to play when i can .
i am so glad they finally have the app for the kindle fire . it was n't available on my phone so i can finally play it now ! ! ! best day ever : )
great game , really brings back the memories . other times can be really frustrating . i wonder where some of it came from !
download took forever now i can not open it to play ! why ? ? ? now how do i open it to play ? once i put a name in it will not open !
if you like word games you will love this . it is a most challenging and enjoyable game i have ever downloaded . playing with friends and family is just great fun .
race on . with a terrific story line and superb graphics , this game will blow your mind . download it to experience it .
i absolutely love this game ! i was the first one in my school to play it because a friend from my other school introduced it and everyone in my school is addicted now , including myself !
i 've been playing this game for about 7 months and i love it . i have a great zoo full of animals and they 've added new content . lots of fun !
this is a fun app for my niece . she 's been having a great time w/ it and it looks well made .
very cool game , this is the first game i have downloaded that i am hooked on . the graphics are really good and the sharks movements are really good . very enjoyable . i would recommend it .
good game , it is fun to play , and any one of any age can play it . fun fun fun . thanks
i liked this game a lot the graphics were good and it was a lot of fun to play and to kill time !
so , i just bought da app and decided to get a skin and it actually works unlike garbage that other apps could be .
same thing over and over . i like the zoom feature . do not like the speed of the timed puzzle . okay .
i wish it had more levels and harder ones too because it is pretty easy you could finish this in a day
too hard for the kids and you must replay levels many times to progress but good variety of games . i have not gotten board yet though
my near 4 yr old loves this and will spend lots of time on this game . he is learning numbers and letters at the same time .
i have always had an interest in the night sky . now i can actually identify what i am seeing without having to read through a book .
downloaded this game yesterday and it 's very addicting . graphics is amazing and the instruction are easy to follow . this game is worth getting .
never used it . decided i did n't want it . plus my tablet broke before i was able to use it , got a new one and decided not to download this app .
this game was fun at first but in order to play after the first half hour , you have to buy the next level . this could get very expensive .
i am sad that my mom and baby died but i am going to say that this app is fun i love it !
it 's a good time waster . some you get right away and others you have to think for a while . i would recommend it to anyone .
a great game for interest and challenges . not just a time filler , but something to grab your interest and imagination . well worth playing .
this is fun i like this game la la la la la la la la la la la la la
i do n't think there is a single person now a days who has not used this app . it works great .
makes it very easy to monitor memory and cache usage by apps on the system . nice interface that 's simple to use .
ca n't make it go away . i do n't use it but i ca n't make it go away . i do n't use it but i ca n't make it go away .
perfect for the tablet , easy to learn and use , my new go to for keeping my life in order . highly recommend this app .
addictive ! gets harder as you play . i love this game.i would recommend this to anyone wanting a challenging game . get it !
this is a wonderful game that has you think about how a set of four pictures relate to each other . a great game to play with another person .
i downloaded this game for my husband to use on my kindle . he already has one on his phone , so since i 'm not interested in playing i have no use for it .
best faotd in a while ... fun to play ... challenging and a great way to pass time ... lots of levels and you can replay for better scores ...
awesome app , been playing it nonstop since i got it ! also i like the way you battle in this game
this is a pretty fun game but you can run out of energy pretty fast if you 're not careful . you do n't have to spend your money if you 're patient .
this has a bit of the touch of angry birds but a new way to move your characters it takes practice when you get farther into the game is a great twist you wont go wrong
did not like this version at all . i think it was the ads or something like that . in any event it was deleted . try it for yourself . your opinion may be different .
love t his game my and my kid both play it and she can play for hours if i would let her we use it as a reward program we use she get some much game time
this game is stupid you have to pay for the other 2 people to do their hair actually you have to pay for pretty much everything . also it hardly gives you anything to do .
a lot of fun but also very frustrating , keeps me entertained just wish sometimes i had more than 5 lives at a time
sorry , big bubble , i do n't have enough room on my tablet , and you 're one the ones that had to go .
this game is so fun . too bad it has a little glitch . deal with it . it is not even a major problem
ive only started playing but i must say i have really enjoyed it so far . i just found a new favorite game .
i love this game soooooo much . it is my favorite . i am not ever going to take it off of my kindle
i love this game ! it is challenging but doable . i have played well into the night . in two weeks , i have completed 9 levels and i ca n't wait for more .
this was not what i expected . it did not work for me for some reason . i would have gave no stars , but you have to rate something .
very clean . i love the hints . free cell is my favorite one because it seems like you can always win if you are good at the game .
i have been wanting to get minecraft or at least a substitute for a long time . this game is beautifully designed and is much better than pocket edition . i really suggest you buy it .
a solid logic game that makes you think without driving you crazy . it could use more levels since its addictive and you 'll keep playing until you do them all .
it 's an alright game , pretty simple i prefer hidden objects more but still nice way to keep from being bored .
i have really enjoyed the game it is very challenging i am happy i bought the full version . if you enjoy hidden object games you need to get this game
the game can be fun , but if you make mistakes and need to begin again it costs you some money ,
have played this on my laptop and phone . so of course downloaded it to my tablet . love it ! highly recommend !
mindless fun game . it 's free and will kill time , could even be addictive . works well and has great colors . and it 's free ...
its a great time passer . my husband an i play this together he enjoys trying to guess the icon before i get it .
wonderful free chess game ! basic but all you need to have fun . thank you for putting this out there free . ive enjoyed it immensely
downloading recipes , along with pictures , is easy on my kindle fire . i find myself using chef tap all the time .
just started playing the game and it is ok so far . i am still seeing how it goes . have fun
extremely cute : ) ! you have kids ? this is perfect for them . the story and graphics are excellent . fun , great and cute learning app for the kids .
this app and games are very educational and not difficult . my grandson and i both love this game and app .
in expensive . you can drop in and drop out with out losing progress . fun distraction while waiting for movies , planes , lunch , etc ...
here again , i love bingo games . this is a very pleasant game to pass the time . i usually play it every day .
i get the feeling this may be a battery drain , but it 's great for a laugh and you ca n't help but want to check up on your silly hero .
this is a very good game i play it i like it i love it ... .it is more challenging then the first one .
the game itself is fun , the pop ups are annoying and distracting since they come up during play . i would not recommend this game because of them .
it will keep you entertained for awhile . it is a time management game . a little slow at first but then once you get the hang of it you are good to go . a good kids game .
this game is challenging and fun . it 's nice to play a game that is something different . go ahead , try the game ... you will get hooked !
answers are just as crazy as the real game . sometimes it slow to respond and it seems like the questions have n't been updated in years
i love all the bonus rounds the game is great i have had hour 's of fun thanks for your time and effort you put in to this game..
this will give you so much help picking out books you might like . connect with other readers to see what they think of books before you buy !
this is a great way of story telling . it helps the reader to learn what goes into writing a story .
my nine year old grandson wanted this game . he plays it when he is here visiting and has now mastered it .
i do n't get this game ! it was not at al what i expected and did not enjoy it but it might be what you are looking for .
its a different twist from other games . i have n't quit got the hang of it as of yet but i 'm sure that i will . until then we will see how it goes .
this is a great game , and i have n't gotten bored yet ! although it is tough to & quot ; make friends & quot ; because they are n't listed ...
pretty much exactly what i thought it would be , and is exactly what you think it will be ! solid sequel , nothing over the top outstanding
i like games that will get you to other screens and give you a challenge . so far that has not been the case .
this is a nice clock . it is accurate and does what you want a clock to do . no complaints here .
very relaxing game.. ca n't stop playing , every level is just as exciting as the last one . suggest this game to anyone wanting a relaxing game
i really enjoy this slot game . it is fun and challenging . the graphics are cute and sounds funny . winning is fairly regular .
i enjoyed this game for a while but then got sick have having to have money and stuff to keep going . but the game itself is great .
my 12 year old daughter and i love this game . we have a kindle hd . she is always trying to beat my high score .
i recall a pc game years ago that i loved that was very similar to this and i am glad i found a replacement of sorts . lots of challenging and fun puzzles .
i had n't played the card game spades for years , but was able to review the rules and get right back into it . it is very easy to follow the game . lots of fun .
i 'm stuck on one game and its been awhile , so i 've kind of stopped playing it . but it is a good brain teaser and can really make you think .
its ok. but not the best . be better it you could move around . but overall a fun game . like the graphics .
i think that this game is so awesome i play it all of the time it is so great buy now
this is a great app for free . i couldnt really demand more from a free app . it 's a remote to control your devices from your smart phone with even mouse and keyboard functions .
i have probably played all the bubble games there are and this so far is the best . you can pick your own pace from easy to hard so that is a plus .
this is super easy to use ! especially if fractions are n't for those using it . i would recommend it to others .
not really a fun game i use to play another game like this on line that was much more fun
it is a little limited , but other than that it works most of the time . it is too bad you require so many words for i have said all i have to say .
adobe reader is a great program that allows you to download and read documents on a kindle . a must have ! ! !
i do n't understand how to get past to get past level 5 , plz help . over all i think its a good game so far
i use google for everything i search for , i have no complaints . its easy to use and always finds what i need .
i love that you can dress them up and do there make up and do there hair i love the game .
so far , so good ! and , i will admit this is a challenging game . slightly harder than i thought , but definitely in a good way .
i like this game and think it is very fun except that it gets to be too difficult at the higher levels .
i ca n't put it down . the only problem is the items are so small i had to pull my glasses out .
great interface works well with my kindle . easy to log on and take care of your quick banking needs when on the go !
neat app . good deals and good places . i love amazon and i love them even more because of this app
very fun game & i recommend it to anyone who likes to play bingo . there are so many rooms & types of bingo you can play as well as speed that you want to play at .
love this game , me and my daughter sit and play it together all the time and she really likes it too ! !
i really like it . it 's so much better than the other i 've tried bingos . great game . so glad it 's free !
this is one of the better ones that i have played . i have alot of them on my kindle but this one happens to be the best so far .
everyone was right about this app . there is nothing there once you download it . they want you to buy another subscription .
this app runs all the time even when your not using it . i shut it down and it came back on by itself . look for another alarm .
this game is ok not a lot to do just too much reading no action not like the other games i play
a nice relaxing , yet challenging game ! i play a couple levels each night as i unwind from my day . a favorite !
understand before you get this that it is just a demo and the levels can be beaten in about ten minutes . it 's still fun though
it 's awesome because it 's all ages and you get to have a car and have kids ! ! ! so it was worth it !
super fun and addictive . great graphics and lots of levels . music is good . my wife loves it too . she 's been playing it all day .
i never received this game on my kindle i dont know why i looked for it but never found it on the list i was disappointed when it didnt download please help me
interesting story line so far ... graphics are nice and the puzzles are a good challenge , not too easy . comic book presentation is a great addition .
g5 realy knows how to rope you in . just finished the trial and i 'm hoping that the full version is as good or better .
this game is a great android version of clash of clans . it takes a bit to get going but once you do it is really fun and strategic .
i like minecraft because it is realistic , but this one is kinda stupid . it 's not as great l as the xbox version . but it 's still fun . i highly recommend for minecraft players .
slow , boring , etc etc just another one of those games like farmville super annoying , dont waste your time on this .
this game is a lot of fun , after down loading played for hours and just had a blast fun fun .
because it doesnt work very well . not sure what else to say or do . will try to do it again
i did n't think i would have to pay for everything . it 's not as expensive as buying the book but i would rather go on a free website and read than pay for it .
do n't get this app unless you already had the dragon program on your computer . it was totally worthless to me .
this game is really fun and challenging without being frustrating ! i reccommend this game to everyone ! really worth the price !
i like the variety of games and might even use credits for food etc . the next time i go to a casino . wish i could spend to earn credits more than once a day .
great fun . takes a minute to get the hang of it , but it keeps you on your toes . would recommend it
it 's pretty good for solitaire which gets boring rather quickly . nice and clear and easy to play . would be nice to have other options of solitaire available .
i think it 's fun but would like to be able to get more outfits quicker . but it is still a fun game
fun game . hard to put down . good for any time you have a few minutes to relax . everyone can play this .
i do n't like this app it just did n't meet my needs for what i was wanting to do so i do n't like it much
love that it is available and free on my kindle . still trying to see what stations i want to download . but overall it allows me to listen to the stations i like . thanks .
i got this for my kindle and it is a pretty good game . if you like sudoku , you 'll probably like this game .
like i said above this is a really fun app and also kills time i love playing this game yea so download it
o ya best game ever who cares what the other people say get this awesome game . if u do n't i will find u. haha
this game is great . i mean its simple and fun . so what more can you ask for . the game is free . thats all i need to say .
this is a fun game but i think it 's more fun when u play with a friend and some of the things i have to get right i do n't know what they mean .
this game is so boring for 6 years old people but for 2 year old people it should be fun for them
it 's fun and challenging . when i get done every level , i can just start all over again . months of fun !
i like this game but storage fills up very fast . i would have given it 5 stars if storage was n't an issue . graphics are great !
i really really like this game , grandma . thanks for letting me choose it . i could play with your kindle all day .
bought back a lot of memories from when i was younger . this may be a simple game but will get your mind working . would encourage more parents to let their kids play this game , nothing gets killed
exciting and challenging i enjoy the pictures puzzles and support line mode . it brings the titanic to leave in a new way
this game is not that fun . you get timed and the bomb has to load . it looks fun on the picture but its really not .
like the title says if you only pop balloons for three or four minutes any kid will get board quickly . not much to it besides that .
love this game , fun to play ! enjoy drawing although am not that good at it . glad we have this !
i was doing homework and if i have not had this calculator i would have failed it and have gotten a & quot ; c & quot ; in his class but with this i got an a .
i liked this game it was cool . i like the match 3 style type of games . keep those games coming .
this game is awesome but there 's only one thing i do n't like its 3 bucks ! what the heck were people thinking !
i really really love this game ! ! ! it 's so much fun ! ! ! i love playing it ! ! ! i 'm gon na tell everyone how fun it is ! ! !
this calculator app has been excellent to use . the keys are large and it runs smoothly . very happy with it !
this slot game is so much fun with great bonuses , , , , , , , i wish i could connect to my facebook account but every time that i try to it never connects : (
got this after stars to to see what it was like and it is n't as pretty as the second one but just as much fun
sweet app so cool you can watch it in any were you want to . i love that you can watch disney channel anywhere
i love playing angry birds . all versions . i like to use it as a stress reliever and the fact that it is ad-free is worth the 99 cents
i love the game it is really fun and challenging . i do n't like the fact that i am unable to ask for help from my friends when need help with extra lives .
love love love this game hours of fun even as a family game very fun and well if you bored this will kill the boredom
i love the game mahjong , and this free version is just too fun ! the design is done well , and easy to play !

just love this very much you can do your own pictures and would download this you like puzzles you will love this
i love how easy it is to play , a favorite game from childhood ! i would recommend this game for all ages !
the game itself is very fun but the ads are everywhere , and it gets annoying every time you wan to play
it 's not as good as tiny wings , but that game is n't available on the amazon store so this game will stay on my kindle fire until tiny wings hopefully becomes available .
this is a good solid app . ive just started with it but i like the graphics and the features . you have several tile sets to choose from .
this game helps my son to learn to control the device . you take the bones and like a puzzle match them to the dinosaur . he is playing it now . great game
i did n't like it is too fast to keep up with in my opinion and is not fun to me i suppose i am not a bingo player .
this game is very fun and very addictive ! i love the graphics , the possible combos , and different characters ! great game for anyone !
the game is fun but they need to fix the update issue . other then that it 's like every other game if you do n't want to spend real money you have to be very patient .
my niece absolutely loves playing this over and over again . always hits the hard button , so i wish there was more to do .
this app is so fun and i love that the words are so hard to guess i can be really hard to guess i love that you have to do that
this a really nice game . it is fun to play it and it is really good for the people that love fashion .
i really enjoy these games there is many to choose from once you get them unlocked the graphics are good i tell my friends about how fun they are to play
buy this app it rocks . people say its dumb . do n't belive it . i do n't see how its so bad . awesome app
love this game i love a challange and this has a new one every time and its addicting it keeps me going i like the new app
wonderful graphics , puzzles , and music . it is very relaxing to play and very nice when you do n't have anything to do .
i thought this would be better than it was . sorry i like other bubble games better . this is boring to me
i like the puzzles . i just finished all the puzzles and will have to restart or wait for a update .
this app will surely make your boring days over . this is my time killer when i 'm at the office and nothing to do .
my kids love playing this game . it is challenging , but great for coordination and learning to have a steady hand .
i am a movie buff and i really like this game . i play it with my family who also likes to watch movies especially those we used to watch when we were younger .
challenging , fun and very strategic game to play . love playing with people who like a challenge and yet totally fun to play .
this game is a lot more fun than i expected . you can still have loads of fun without buying stuff with real money .
so far the game is exactly what i like to play ! ! hope it has an interesting ending , and more mini games ! !
i recommend this game to every one young and old . i love these kinds of games . it very entertaining and even educational .
no glitches no nothing ! its perfect ! ! ! love it love it love it ! ! ! ! i adore it . it is so addicting ! please get it ! i reccomend it for everyone ! !
i really like this game . easy to play and great at wasting time . would give 5 stars if cards had auto function
this app drives e crazy , once i start i hate to put it down . i am playing games like this to keep me on my toes plus i like the challenge .
this is a much needed guide to get you thru 100 floors . there are floors that you would n't be able to advance to if you did n't have the guide . glad i got it .
this sucks . i try to install this app but it always has an error same with the tetris game app . i do n't reccommend this app .
it 's just a solitaire app . nothing special . get anyone of these games you want and you 'll see no difference in the game .
boring and no interaction . i deleted it about 20 minutes after downloading it . what a waste of space . could 've been a lot better .
its fun but the only bad thing is , is the energy . it toes forever just to get 5 energy nonetheless . 10 .
very helpful and easy to use . good to help me with remembering what the lord has done for me and that he is always with me .
this game is super fun ! ! i love it so much , it makes me love pizza even more ! ignore the reviews that say it 's bad when its really not .
very cute game . like all the different things going on . fun for anyone . this is a great game to play anytime , lots of great things going on with different levels
not good at all , it not what i was expecting i do n't like it and my grandchildren did n't care for it
t h i s i s. s s s s s s s d d d d d d d d f f f f f f d d d f f f f f
about a minute into the game it crashes no matter what i do . possibly memory size . on kindle . 19 20 .
this is a very good game . fun to pass time with . i think you should get it . its really fun
they do n't give you enough money to play without having to pay for it but the game it still fun
i played this game on the computer and now on kindle fire just great . this game is so . fun and realistic .
i do n't play these games cause they freeze up or do n't have good graphics but this is really addictive its a blast
this game is really cool . it like im on the computer solitaire version . its really fun . you should get it .
it 's ok. pretty easy . be good for the younger children . did n't take long to get through the levels . buy for kids .
my daughters and i play on fairy salon all the time without getting bored . the selection and beautiful colors are the best i 've seen on any of the salon apps
it is a rather boring game , no interaction as everything is in the blind to the player who playing it
this is a fun and addictive game which is fun to play . you will enjoy playing it . great graphics and sound . works well on my kindle .
easy to play great graphics it does deserves a five stars and again i thank u for hours of fun and u people please keep up the great work .
this would be a great game if it did n't start over my game , and every time i & quot ; die & quot ; it wont let me play again !
this is one of my favorite games , i can play this one for hours , very good game and i really like it
i love this game so much that i play it every day ! if you do n't if you should get this app , you should .
it is a lot like minion rush but simpler . my 5 year old loves it . colorful graphics . cute characters . runs smoothly .
this program has variety . i like the idea of getting to pick what i want to see . movies and/or tv series .
it just keeps on force closing . would be good if it could work but it ca n't . nothing like the description .
i like this game very much just wish you could get more lives when you play so you could play longer
its neat to use but does n't work for a lot of the scans . just for fun i b use it for
this game is fun . i just got it and i 'm already on level 2 a lot better than other slot games : )
we love this game ! it 's nice to have the picture matching option for those who are still learning to read . my 5 year old has had fun with it .
i love this app ! your bible , song book , and daily text all in the same place ... no excuse not to read your bible daily !
i have become totally addicted to this game since buying it , i hope there is a limit to how deep you can dig , otherwise i may never stop playing : p
so fun . i love this game . if you get it you will love it . it is one of the best games in the amazon appstore .
i love this game , very kid friendly , fun and addicting . i really recommend it . so easy , any age can play it .
i like this game . it 's one of my favorites and i like to play it all the time with my son . it has a different way of playing bingo .
although it is n't the computer version but it is the best app ever made for on the go it is so fun when on multiplayer . it is worth the seven dollars get it now now now
i thought it was really good till you have to purchase the full game . if were on sale would definitely purchase
while i like the concept of this game , they do not give you nearly enough time . 10 seconds to read and answer is ridiculous . i uninstalled just based on that fact .
i just found this game and love it ! you can win a lot , and i like the sounds ( important to me ) .
i bought this game and played it for a long time ! ( and then i had to take care of my horses ) then i came home and played it till bed .
it is so nice to have this story classic in your collection ! my grandson enjoys it when i read this to him . i highly recommend this to all !
fun and addictive . i love bingo . i can sit and play bingo all day . my kids play it too and they love it .
angry birds is fun , so i 've been downloading everything angry birds , but the space angry birds is quite different . i do n't find it as much fun as the other angry bird apps .
really fun retro gaming . reminds me of the good old days of video gaming . a whole bunch of fun . and it plays really smooth .
this was bought without mom 's permission . but , i 'm sure it was fun .
this game is fun and i enjoy playing it . it 's challenging and fun and my kids like playing it too .
it 's pretty fun but it is also challenging . it was worth buying considering it was a free game . : ) so try it out , its free !
works great . love that the card . goes right to the spot it needs to go when you just tap on it .
very addicting game . just ca n't figure out how to get more dollars . but the game is fun . kinda like farmville .
just downloaded this game and so far it has been fun to play . graphics are great for a hand held device and the action flow is good but not overly challenging ( yet ) .
my nieces and nephew love to play games on my kindle and this one is fun and educational . cute animals and easy games for a variety of ages .
i 've had lots of fun with the fall mahjong app . it is more difficult than other mahjong apps that i have .
i have no problems with this ap . this ap does what it should . much easier to access bank data from the ap than the web .
sometimes it takes too long to find a random player . also , some of the players just write the word on the screen instead of drawing . the game is draw something ! ! !
this app was purchased for my 4 yo grandson . he loves it . 4 stars because nothing is perfect . great for the younger crowd
fun and enjoy a lot ! easy to learn too . anyone and everyone would like this game . great game give it a chance . different modes of finding the hidden objects .
the game is ok. i like it . i have n't gotten to the more challenging puzzles yet , but am looking forward to them .
there is not not much to do in the game . seemed very boring for anyone ! even very young kids thought it to be boring !
really fun and creative for people who love those town designing games but the only problem is sometimes it takes too long to earn money because of how many times you can get some
the game is great and the amount of levels and bonus levels that it has is great for the money keeps kids busy for hours
this is the funniest bingo game that i have played in a long time . i can spend hours playing it .
i really enjoyed this game . it has been very entertaining and keeps me occupied at home or on the go .
short and boring . wish i could get my money back . love hidden object games but not this one . sorry i bought it .
challenging game i do admit it does get boring after awhile but my goal is to find the blue coins but i 'm not sure if their are any .
grandson ca n't figure it out and i could n't either . otherwise i guess it is an okay game just wish they provided more instructions .
great game to spend alittle time on . had fun playing . great graphics . for kindle fire . cant wait to play it again soon .
its fun and enjoyable to play its a good time killer i if you love pets this is app for you
i have downloaded several of the jigsaw apps . this particular app did not appeal to me because of the pictures .
love this . love that u can build your own station and listen to all types of music . keep it up .
actually i was looking for instagram , i guess it is not possible to have it yet on kindle so i just deleted this one since that 's not what i wanted in the first place
i am addicted to this game , sometimes ca n't put it down . great for a time killer in appointments , etc ... . thanks .
i love this game other than it kinds getting too hard then i get bored and do n't even try to solve it anymore . but its fun otherwise .
this is one of the best apps in the world along with all the other angry birds games . great for passing time by .
awsome game have a lot of fun playing the game it works really well on kindle fire hd so i would like to recommend this game to everyone
awesome awesome awesome this game is by far the best slots game out there the bonuses are awesome hourly bonuses could be a little bigger though
i do n't feel terribly challenged or entertained with this game . i am glad it was a free game vs a pay for game .
nothing exciting about this game . it is what it says it is nothing more . not thrilled with the short time limit .
it wont let me buy coins but other than that this game is amazing i love it i cant put it down
it is a very good game if you have the time to play . i think children would like it more . the graphics are okay .
nice logic game . you have to buy your levels but they need to get paid something . fun ideas for puzzles . will play this game more .
this is my favorite game on my kindle ; i play it often . it is complicated enough to make playing it challenging .
i love movies and thought i would give this a try . usually i get bored quickly but i keep going back .
i love this game . it 's a game that makes you think before you make your next move . it also gives you different ways of playing the bubble buster .
this a great app to have . it is entertaining & amp ; fun . a new adventure everytime . i am glad i downloaded this app . my kids really love it .
bad app , dont waste the download space on this one and if you are really curious , do n't get it unless its free .
this app has everything that can be good for an app , graphics , good gameplay , simple controls , and free ! only reason not to like is that it takes a while to install
it has been keeping me busy for hours . i really enjoy the village and making it grow toward the island . lots of fun !
this app is a lot of fun . me and my six yr old daughter both play . i love horses and enjoy how life like . this is .
my boy loves trucks so this puzzle game was great for him . he really enjoys when he gets it all right and the balloons fly .
the graphics are very nice . it is a little confusing one in awhile but i ' e been able to figure everything out so far .
this game is very & quot ; vegas & quot ; without the drive . plays like the real thing . definitely addictive and fun ! i highly recommend this app .
this game is extremely addicting . i play it whenever i get a spare minute , and my skills are constantly increasing . play !
my five year old daughter loves this ! nice distraction when absolutely necessary , and she 's learning at the same time . thank you so much .
it 's a good app but some logos are hard i love to play logo quiz its one of the only games i play
i love these kinds of games . i like not having to constantly build new buildings and stuff like other games . i wish the energy filled up more quickly however .
i play several times a week live . problems with this is you need to spend too much for a & # 34 ; free & # 34 ; game .
this game is very addicting because it test your reflexes and you will try to get a really high score . it 's fun because the character are cool and the different works are really great .
i did n't understand what it said about u and your friends . if u can plz tell me if it is about it would be very helpful .
a fun game and i am enjoying it . i really like the sounds it makes when you make a match !
this game is a great time killer . it keeps your brain active instead of just playing a mindless game to pass the time .
amazing how many games are in this one app . i was only familiar with a few of those offered but it has tutorials to help you learn each game . will not get bored learning !
this game is great on the kindle fire , and has excellent graphics , this is a must have game , don wait get it now
with no instructions on how to set up and just touching the scene changes the settings . i was highly disappointed with this product .
i was always having to log on to my laptop for pinterest and now i can use my kindle fire . thank you sweet god ! ! !
i love this because its totally free . the notifications work great on my kindle fire . a box pops up as soon as i get the message . totally recommend ! ! !
i did appreciate earning the bit coins for the purchase . however it would have been even better to get the application to work in my kindle hd .
this game is ok if you want to keep purchasing coins which i dont and never will another game to take your money is not what people want
i would recommend this game for anyone who wants a kid kept entertained . it works great for fun and great price since was free .
this app is incredible . now when my cousin wants her shows on , i can watch mine at the same time .
just did n't hold my interest . probably ok for many , but just for me . & little words is better . go for it
great game . i love it . it 's fun , intriguing , addicting and can be done for two minutes or twenty . great for passing time while you 're waiting for someone or something .
simple to play card game . another way to pass time when there 's nothing else to do . the screen could be larger .
i love it but it took forever to come up sorry i could not give it 5 but too long
this is definitely the best puzzle game that i have ever played . i look forward to more games like this .
. good thing it was free . got to a certain level and could not go any further without buying anymore coins
i love watching the show , so the game on my 2nd generation kindle fire is awesome ! ! i love it ! ! no glitches or anything . really fun ! !
it is a cool game and easy to play . i would recommend it . it is also enjoyable and peaceful to watch too .
this is a great and funny app . i love the icon . the graphics are terrific and the game play is great . i love this type of game . great job !
i really really really really really really really really really really really love this game it has great graphics and a bunch of fun mini games
after download game would not work on my samsung . it would turn off when i clicked on the play button .
after playing it for about 3 minutes , it got kinda boring . would you rather buy a app that is fun or play a app thats boring ? your choice .
this is a super cute game and not gross at all ! i is just a silly time killer and a fun app to show people even if u do n't play it !
this is an exciting game it is mixed with time and patience . you can play this game when you are bored .
this is o.k . but not enough of a challenge for me . i may try the other more difficult ones when i have time . right now i would recommend this for other people .
if you like this game , then this app is for you . it is very addicting though . it is easy to use , and a fun game .
ok game with nice graphics . but got bored of it after a day or so . not as engaging as other games .
have had this for about 4 months without one problem . great go to game when waiting in airport or elsewhere . you really compete with yourself in a big way .
entertaining for kids or easily amused people . it 's pretty simple . it could use some more options to the app , but it 's entertaining .
great game when alone or just need a quick distraction . easy to play , understand and is not too hard or complicated
this is an excellent game . it may be confusing at first , but you come to love it eventually . i recommend this .
i know found it ! this is the best slots game out there . fun fun ! you win chips like crazy . i 've never had to buy chips , ever !
it 's okay for a bank app . was n't my fav . but now i 'm no longer with them so it 's all good !
i got this app for my great grand daughter , she did not like it . she played it a few times but would quit after a short time . perhaps an older child would like it better .
very enjoyable game just wished it had been a little longer . i did have some trouble finding one of the status but finally got it .
i want the game on my kindle . i do n't need cheats or how to play . i think it should be on my kindle because it is one of my favorite games . please
i love this game . it is the best bingo i have ever had . the whole family loves it love it
forget the free one and just but the full version . it is fun and my kids love it . i think my husband and i play it more then they do .
this game is very fun and very addictive and i would love more games like this . it kind of reminds me of diner dash and that 's my favorite game .
both my children love the interactive part of the story . i had no idea that was part of it but glad it 's there .
this little app is the perfect solitaire game . i have this one and free cell . i have them on the kindle fire hd , and have never had a problem .
yes it was quite a big download but it just works awesome on my phone . just hope they catch up the tablet support . my wife is getting a xoom and loves bejeweled . thanks amazon !
this is a great little app . they did a nice job with it and it works well . if you like backgammon then i 'd highly recommend it .
finally on kindle and free i love this game lots of challenges an fun for everybody i love this game
not worth downloading ! i downloaded this because i thought it would be entertaining and it was not ! not worth it !
it 's a fun game and easy to play . my kids can even help me with some of these . they love this game too ! !
the game is awesome ! ! ! i logged it in to my facebook in another tablet , but when i try to log it on here , it force closes . please fix . thanks so much : )
this is the game for you if you like puzzles and hidden objects . it also lasts along time . i have not found it to be boring at all .
this was fun but definately not my favorite mahjong game . i 'm a more traditional mahjong player & this one was n't what i was looking for .
this game is so fun . some times it gets you so mad that you ca n't beat the levels otherwise it 's pretty fun .
ive always loved this now classic game even when i was playing it on my desktop . do n't like the constant upgrade requests though a bit of a pain .
nice app works well and its a fun game . a great idea too . i like this game a lot ! ! l
get this . it 's great fun and frustrating at the same time . plain straight forward graphics . no need for fancy graphics , would recommend .
i 'm thinking of getting rid of this app . uno is n't easy to use at all . it 's very hard to get the cards to move where you want them .
i enjoy this game daily . my daughter saw me playing this game and called me the next . day to tell me she now plays the game on her lunch break .
this game is great . fast paced and true to the original card game . i would recommend this for all ages .
it is to hard for my grandson to play . i prefer a little more easy navigation for a 3 yr old .
great game for free ... challenging game ... have fun playing at night when starting to relax ... better than most others have tried in app store
pretty fun game , ca n't put it down since i installed it . the other granny games are n't as fun but this one is addicting .
i am not a fan of cnn , and i usually watch my local news , but since thats not possible as i travel i checked out cnn . really interesting and entertaining . well organized app .
my daughter bought this on my kindle and she loves it.. to me its funny watching her play it so much
downloaded this last night and it 's very hard to put down . a great game to play while on the go .
did n't like this app for my kindle fire , there are better ones available . connection issues , and its not on my side .
i love puzzle games . this one is fun and easy . great for beginners . i will look forward to more like this . graphics could be better , but not bad for a free game .
you can prank people when they are watching tv shut it off and when they turn it back off turn it back off . hahaha
this is the awesome app and i 'm only on level 13 please write back to me so you can give me the cheats
i love this game . it is very , very fun and pretty easy . some may be a little challenging but it is great for all ages .
i really was excited to play the game but says i am offline when i have wifi . bummer ! maybe developer can fix bug . i am using a new kindle fire .
this game is so much fun ! i cant stop playing it . why is there a minimum on the review ? oh well .
it was so fun until this ad came and it said buy full version . i exited the game . when i played again , the stupid ad would n't let me play !
did n't play a lot on this one so its kind of hard to rate it but if you like adventure games get it and play .
once you start you can not stop . it is hours of fun for all . down load this and you will be glad you did !
the game is fun but have had better ones to play . wish the & # 34 ; coins & # 34 ; given were given in less time .
i like the game , but after you finish a puzzle it asks if you want to buy it . i downloaded it to play for free .
it was fun for a couple of minutes . i have n't had the black screen but have had difficulties moving birds around . got bored quickly .
it 's okay . it downloaded quickly . this game requires one think through the steps they will take before they take them .
works for what it is , it is n't something i wanted but faotd i own it so i may use it someday .
oh yeah . ty for a cool and fun game ! ! more like this one in the future plz ! ! this game is awesome .
the game is great . if you like games that are calming and can raise dragons this is for you ! also you earn money for completing goals and spend it for your dragons
love this game . if you like puzzle games you will like this . lots of levels of really challenging game play . highly recommend this game for puzzle lovers .
it is so confusing . i do n't get it at all ! can someone explain it to me . does anyone know how to play this game ! ! !
i like this game . it is enjoyable with little to no issues that i have seen . great if you like bingo .
i enjoyed this app . very entertaining and can be challenging . completed the story and cant wait for the second one to come out .
this is a nice game to keep the mind sharp . the graphics are nice and the puzzles are challenging . this has been so much fun .
this game did n't really make sense to me at all . i did n't care for it and neither did my little cousins or nephew .
different puzzle game where you move blocks instead of cut pieces . i t seems easy but gets progressively more complicated . fun time waster !
its netflix , what more is there to say , the app works great and does what is needed . i would recommend you get netflix if you do n't have it .
this is a great game . i really enjoy playing this game . it really keeps you wanting to improve your score .
not much to this little app , but it i enjoy making pretty designs with it . it 's a fun little free app !
just a regular solitaire game . colorful . easy to play which is always useful . i 'd recommend it to those who like cards .
this game is fantastic , i had learned very much . always i play learn about the countries in a incredible way
i bought this app thinking it would be good but i 'll never know . and it makes my other apps slow ! : (
this game was not fun at all . it just was not interesting and boring . the story line was not engaging at all .
fun game , but the aiming seems to be off a bit . kind of hard to manage . but love the game.. everyone should play it .
you make it say what u want it to it is not real you put in what u want it to does not work
i use this with my amazon account to watch the movies i 've purchased . so far so good . trying to figure it all out .
its great for all ages and great for kindle fires ! ! ! ! do n't fall for all the other dumb drawing apps , this is the very best and u will love it ! ! ! !
fun for the whole family . good for kids to try to figure out how the pictures are related . we love it .
it did not work right . i could not get it to download at first and then when it did then it would not work .
i think it is designed ok , but i 'm not much of a casino user . i need something that is more challenging .
these slots are really interesting . even if it was a penny machine in the casino , and paid like this , i 'd play all the time . it is fun .
i love this game . its similar to the zuma game and i dont think its available on kindle hd , but this is the next thing .
this is a great product when you are constantly on the move . i also love the easy to use buttons .
i play this occasionally . it is a good game and i enjoy the graphics . it is worth the money to buy it .
some are hard , but some are really easy . fun for a family event , everyone can work together . i love this app ! !
i really like this app but i do n't always get my message till a hour or two later . please fix this .
time certainly did come ... and go , quickly . it was so easy for me to get lost in this episode that i also lost track of time . logic and entertainment combine to make this very enjoyable .
i love this game because it 's fun . if you like flappy bird you will love this i love it ! ! ! : )
i was very disappointed with this game . i would think for all the time they spent with making the graphics look this nice the game would have been much better . do n't waste your money
i love this game it keeps me guessing and i am a boss at it so yea i definitely suggest this to everyone
i love . this game its so cool and my sisters have it to and the menu button is full and there 's more stuff and you earn more than a 100 mini dollars if u have apple
although it is a simple concept because of the quests it can be challenging . i enjoy playing the game immensely .
great game , nice that you can change it up with some different playing options . only downside is not being able to play against others on line ( unless i 'm missing something ) .
this one is pretty boring , but then again it was free so it seems silly to complain about a game i did n't pay for .
not crazy about it . it was ok , but i do n't play most of the games it mentioned . not enough hints . could have been way better .
lots of different versions and plans to help anyone study god 's word . i love having several versions downloaded to my phone , allowing me to read anywhere .
great game , ca n't wait for the second one to come out ! challenging puzzles to solve along with the mystery . play today .
gran run is so much fun . a highly addicting game . i ca n't put my phone down . amazing graphics and challenging game play . fun for all ages
took a while to get used to but now i love it . it 's awesome for mobile tablets . like being at your desk top .
app made no sense . everything is too complicated . i got it for free , and saved 10 bucks . that is more then this app will ever tell me !
its a fun game and you can waste a lot of time on it . the fighting is pretty cool to . ive enjoyed it so far .
really enjoy spelling with this game ! graphics are cool and sounds are great ! really enjoy trying to spell words for time !
very entertaining ! my 6 yr old loves it and will play it for hours if i would let her ! very cute game
i was playing it thinking it was like minecraft and then when the world loaded the control is way to hard and the animals are always trying to hurt you get minecraft pocket edition it is way better .
me and my baby brother love playing this game and try to figure it out . it 's a good learning game in a fun way . i recommend it to all of you who read this .
while i like this game , i do n't play it very often . it is fun and a great way to pass the time .
looks great on my samsung galaxy note ! it takes a little bit to get the strategy down . . . . . .
my granddaughter and i enjoy playing this game together . she can read now and loves reading everything to me . great game , thanks
this is a very easy game to play , even 4 or 5 year olds can play . i like thats its a two player game .
my daughter loves this . got the idea from my sister yo get this app . her son plays with it to
i think this game is just right -- it is challenging but not too frustrating . music gets old after a while . could you vary ? its relaxing .
my five year old daughter loves this game . she loves doing her own make up and mine , this is great for her . she would play it all day if i let her
you need a direct access program to use this program . if you already have access from another company you do n't need this app . very disappointed .
this game has really good graphics and controls . it is a bit redundant with the gameplay in beginning . i hope it gets a bird better . a different location would be nice .
theres a lot of things u have to spend bucks on and its kinda annoying . not that i dont mind paying
best game ever . also new york is looking hot but they forgot to add a place similar to times square
this is the first time i have tried playing a tetris type of game on my kindle fire . it is okay so far . i am sure i will like it better when i get used to it .
this game is great trivia is always a good time and a very popular app i believe everyone i know plays it .
i listen to this at bedtime , as i have had a sleeping problem for a long time . it really works , and relaxes you ,
it was fun . took a little getting used to playing on the kindle . now i wish i had the 9 & # 34 ; kindle to have a bigger screen .
couldnt get a interest in it was ok. like i say on the games i dont like . nothing against the game , but just wasnt my thing .
the cards are so small and light colored it 's hard to read . i would like it better if the cards were larger
i really like this game . lot of fun using my brain . would make a good game for memory . make people to use their brain .
actually only downloaded it because some other game recommended it . but i like it i wish there were several things different but for a free game its okay !
i like the game its really fun but it wont download i have the light version so get it its fun : )
i was hoping for so much more . uninstalled within 24 hours . not worth your time , but maybe the paid version is better .
the app works about 25 % of the time . i hoped that each reading would be accurate but i 'm still waiting for that accurate read .
not a very challenging game and really not related to bingo , i thought it would be more like traditional bingo
i always have 3 or 4 games going with friends and random opponents . ads are n't even that annoying ! go for it
this is a fun game and yes its takes a long long time to download . be patient its worth the fun .
so much fun . wheel of fortune , but with more time to answer i love that aspect of the game . great to play with facebook friends , or people around the country .
love to play the game it is even on my phone play all the time . easy to play my 5 year old granddaughter plays .
this is different than common slots games which makes it interesting . i have n't gotten near to winning a tournament but i just got the app .
absolutely play daily . love it ! have gotten stuck for days on a level but it 's so addictive i keep coming back for more .
fun to play at least first few are easy . easy to fill in letters could be habit forming . nice graphics
my husband loves playing this game ! he loves how you tilt the kindle to steer ! and the fact that my kinda is hd is a plus .
the more i play the harder it is to stop . i find this a very entertaining game . great picture clues .
gives one a real challenge as there is no way to see a solution before you discover it yourself . i enjoy playing it before going to sleep .
this game is great for challenging you and getting you to think outside the box . the only part that sucks is the in game cost for additional levels or hints .
this is a great game , except for the very annoying waiting for new lives . i have nothing else to say about it , as everyone is already familiar with it !
my two year old granddaughter loves to play this app . appropriate for her age and she is very good with the memory game . keeps the attention of children .
used to play this in early computer days . this version is not a very good quality , but it is free , so that 's okay .
i love this game you can have fun , but you do n't have to spend money to play . something different for a change .
kind of fun , for free . the chase camera could have kept up a better pace than it did , and stayed with the plane .
i find this to be excellent on keeping me posted on scores . their new stories are current and up to date . very helpful !
great game to play at night when you ca n't sleep , or when your husband is watching sports or the man channel .
this is a great game ! it is not too easy , and not that hard . a great way to pass the time .
i bought this game for my grandsons who are all under the age of 10. it was difficult for them to learn and required in apps purchases in order to play . not a good choice for me .
would give a lower score if possible . dumb idea even free is to much to spend . one minute playing this game is one too many minutes of a life wasted .
should be on most top 10 lists . great for fast movie resources and etc . fast to open but some ads become annoying .
the game is fun and gets addictive soon . the graphics are great and very easy to play . i would recommend it for anyone that likes this type of game .
this was also downloaded by my 10 year old son . he seems to use it on a regular basis . it would rate as a like .
its ok but it freezes now and then and makes me have to restart my kindle but i love it so far .
i 'm starting to see a pattern with these games by gameloft . got ta say i 'm disappointed and wo n't be getting another gameloft game until they figure out how to make games work without additional downloads .
i enjoy playing this one , it is relaxing and easy to do , thanks for the extra fun for a old lady !
it was ok for just finding things . was not very challenging . if i wanted to have something to do without thinking i would buy another game like this . it was worth .99 ,

this app is awesome for you kindle fire it helps you keep track of your battery and helps you save energy when you have a little left
this really should be called the stupid app . i do n't know why i downloaded it but i soon found out that it was useless .
it was ok i mean you didnt have to pay after using it for so long but to use it you had to be connected to the internet
angry birds do more than fly , they rock ! yet another great game from rovio . addictive , fun , and challenging . a must play game !
i love angry birds and now know the true meaning of the game . i added star wars version and its the same concept with different scenes . i like it just as much .
this game is too hard , character is too small to navigate through obstacles without constantly dying or having to restart the game
i like this game ... it is not as easy as you may think but maybe my aim sucks . i really like it , it is fun and cute .
i downloaded this for my 6 year old granddaughter . it keeps her busy on long car rides and while waiting for appointments . she loves it .

great game . lots of fun . keeps you busy and interested . nice graphics . love the original and love this one just as much .
it seems easy enough . i do agree with others that you should n't have to buy levels or buy hints but so far i have not had to use any .
this is not espn 's app for the website , but it is there app for news and scores . you are able to customize with your favorite teams .
this game is okay , has enough changes to keep it ok for awhile if you win enough not to have to pay for coins , which i would not do ...
have not used it much , but i like it.i have been able to catch my favorite shows so far , but i am sure that i will use more in the future .
i try out many different games . i decided to try this one and have been pleased . it 's great for passing time and simple to play .
there were way to many interruptions for the demo of the game to be enjoyable . i deleted it on the first day .
this product is not what i expected , nice and attractive cover , but has no functionality , and does not give any extras in return . i deleted this app from my kindle .
it is a little weird , it changes worlds & if your not paying close attention you wo n't be able to pick it up
this game had potential but the game play is very limited . even with the purchase of special spending points boredom sets in quickly if your not 10 or under .
my new favorite game - so much fun and quite addicting ! it 's like being a kid again playing the dozer games at the carnival
this game is pretty fun and has food graphics the one thing i do n't like is that there is no exit button otherwise would be a 5 star in my book .

time flies by cuz your sucked into this game it 's fun i would definitely get and recommend this game to anyone with time to kill or bored

... ca n't stop playing it . one of those games that you think of all the answers right after the game ! good fun !
this app is very fun and entertaining . the games cost lots of points but i still give it a 5 because of the the games .

i think this game is good and i think it is a great game . i really enjoy it a lot .
this game is extremely fun and easy to play . i recommend it for anyone who just likes to play a game .
i like being able go access my mail from my mobile device . it makes it convenient when l do n't have easy access to my computer .
can not give a good review because in order to proceed u need to buy within game . this should be stated up front imo . and what the $ will be !
best free app you can get ... have been getting my news at late night and earlier morning ... video portion works great too
i need this to use the camera on my kindle fire hd . it 's good for other things like taking you to your photos , etc .
the free game needs to be longer . i barely started playing before it started making me do reviews . give a few more levels .
this is a really good game . i have been play for a while and have had no problems play it . it 's also good for kids not thing bad and simple .

i like minecraft but this app needs armor and lava . and creative is nothing like pc creative . but its still cool .
this is a really fun game i love it so much my sister my brother my dad my mom and i love it very much .
then you need a battery monitor . there are hundreds of apps like this , but this one is , by far , the best , most accurate , one available .
i ca n't wait to play the 2nd one ! ! very addictive ! did n't want to put it down !
i love it its really addicting and it is very similar to flappy bird and it is challenging which makes it a very great game
just downloaded this and i ca n't stop playing . it 's a nice little brain teaser to make you think . lots of fun
so cute i cant stop just going in and listening to them sing . very soothing actually for a game . very fun
i have heard that this game is a lot of fun to play for all ages , but we could not get it to do anything on our tablet .
i like it . it is a game that anyone can play . young or old . i have fun just trying to beat my own score .
this game is entertaining and all around good fun . lots to do and fun things to customize your bakery with , plus lots of different recipes . i adore playing teamlava games !
i really love these apps ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! this is the best game ever . i love this app . this is great app . cool .
i did not like this hidden object based on the other hidden games i have played on my tablet . i uninstall it off my tablet the same day . just could not get into it like other games .
this gives you the basics for drawing . i have no drawing skills at all but enjoy drawing .
it 's alright for a short time was actually thinking about removing it . did not like it well enough to keep my .
this game is really confusing . needs some work . i would n't recommend this to anyone . upgrades and make it a little less confusing .
my 7 year old wanted to download this app because he 's such a huge fan of mind craft and because it was a free download i allowed him to and he loves it !
the kids like this game . they have been playing the game since i got it . they love it . thank you .
nice . it has some good games that is enjoyable for all age 's . so it is a pretty good game except for the ads .
great graphics , good speed , wonderful on my kindle fire , and very entertaining ! would recommend this bingo game to any one of any age .
this app is necessary to open certain documents and files . it is a no brainer to get this free app for your device .
its ok but i got really far , then it would n't let me catch one so i could n't move on . so ya
love it is my favorite game i play it all the time . : ) : p : d thanks for this app .
great game to teach the kids how to care for their pets ... grandchildren from ages 2 to 6 love playing this game ...
love this game . i have alot of mahjong games & amp ; this is my favorite ! ! wonderful graphics ! great to pass a rainy day with . worth buying ! !
this app does the job i need it to do . simple calculator app that allows you to go back and look at prior calculations . very useful .
i like this app because it comes in handy when i do n't have a piece of paper handy while i am out .
i barely ever buy apps but i am happy i bought this one . runs clear and smooth and not glitchy . great for kids ! i know this is going to be a new favorite for my kids .
i would love this game if the diamonds could be earned instead of requiring money , or if the rooms needed less energy . otherwise i quite enjoy the game .
this was not what i expected . it was more for one or two year old .
i like it so far the themes are fun and it is like most bingo games good to pass the time
great and entertaining game ; i have fun each time i play it ! it has three different levels of challenge which i like .
it is a boring game so do n't waste time in downloading . it held my 7 yr old sons attention for about 10 minutes .
nice ! ! i can download mp3 from videos for free ! ! ! yay ! ! ! anything on youtube . its easy and quick . love it . no viruses ir anything ...
it 's okay but i get no sound with it . i have the regular version on my pc everything is the same but no sound
very nice graphics . lots of variety and relaxing game to play . the finished pictures are really cool , and pretty , and satisfying .
another game that was down loaded on accident its free and i think my son thought it would be fun
this game makes you think . it is very entertaining . i will recommend this game to everyone i know . thank you .
this game os so good i could play it all day and night the graphics are so good it feels like your in the game its so amazing
all i have 2 say is wow . i mean this game rocks it is a great game for like ages 10 to like 40 .
fast , fun and easy to play . keeps my kids entertained on long trips . they even manage to work together on tougher puzzles .
i downloaded this item and then never played it . i have removed it from my device . i do n't recommend it .
works well on kindle fire . great pics , you can make it easy or hard to solve puzzles as you wish .
this is the best game ever ! ! ! ! i play it every day ! ! if you have n't gotten it yet , get it right now ! ! !
this game is fun but it is very bad you have to buy stuff . it is in possible to get coins .
this is n't as easy as you may think . lots of fun and pretty puzzles to put together . lots of fun for everyone . love it .
hate it ! it 's boring and not worth the time it takes to down load . i would not recommend this to anyone .
its fun and all nut its just that as soon as u get the point u barely want to play it anymore so its fun i guess
i love this game . the only downside is after every few turns i have to exit out of an ad . other than that it is very entertaining and works well on my kf hd .
i love this game and its fast pace . i am so addicted . i cant put the kindle down . i told all my friends about it .
no insane running back and forth , good storyline and great puzzles . my favorite so far ( of the 20 or so played )
fun , but another wait a year to get something done or pay pays with real cash to buy coins , food , and etc .
i got this for my grandson . he loves the game and plays it as soon as he comes over
you have to get it the grafics are way better and its just awesome al my friends are playing it and ya so ... ... .
i just installed this and so far it is super fun . i think i will get a lot of enjoyment out of it ! and it is free !
good game , g5 makes some of the best hog games out there . tho do n't like having to take 25 words to explain that its a good game ,
this is a very good game . i like this game . it was as they had described it . it was fun to play this game .
i have no problems at all . my mom and i love this app and we play it every single day . it 's one of our favorites .
would not let me download ! ! i was so excited for this game but now i cant be excited cuz i cant even gt the app
for a free game it is great . it is simple but still engaging . my only complaint is that your energy runs out too fast .
so much fun . you have to get this if you like jigsaw puzzles . you will love it . there 's something for everyone .
this app may be terrific . but it is such a space hog , can not be moved to the sd card , that i simply did not have room on my smartphone to try it .
lot of fun , good time killer . with the upgrade system , ill be playing for a while . one of the best free apps of the day , and would be worth paying for
this is one of my favorite games . it is challenging and rewarding and you can play with all of your friends .
fun game , but i got bored easily with this game . it may be fun for others , but just not a huge kindle gaming .
not much to say about ... i ca n't get it to run on my kindle . did manage to draw a picture but is about it ... it keeps crashing ! : (
i 've never played mahjong before but found this very easy to learn and start playing after a 30 second tutorial . also looks great on my kindle fire .
this game is addictive and is so enjoyable to play . you do n't get tired because the game board is always changing .
this is a pretty fun game but it can not be played without a wi-fi connection . if you 're on the road , forget about playing this game .
the game is good , my only problem is having to either buy or unlock stuff , besides that the game is really fun to me
usually love hidden objects game , but i uninstalled the game within an hour after installing it . pop ups of other things continually during the game !
i have to agree with a lot of the reviews . i thoroughly enjoyed this game ! it was a great length , had some challenge but not too much , and interesting . i def recommend it .
this game is really fun so far . the only problem i have with it is it slows down a little when you click on something and you will probably need real money to play it
this game is awesome . i love that you can zoom in and out to get a better look at the entire screen . i highly recommend this game to anyone .
i love this game . it 's so addicting . 5 stars . i ca n't put it down . by far my new favorite game .
i ca n't let it go , i keep wanting to solve each puzzle . its fun and very interesting and informative . good fun
i found that this game is not much fun and do not play it now . i just like to read to much to play many games .
this game is very cute . but it is slow and expensive . if you ca n't play everyday then do n't even try this one .
it took me a while to get the hang of this game but once i did i was hooked ! the app was easy to download and the graphics are fantastic !
i have not had a chance to use this app . i believe it will be helpful . i like the idea of video chat . this app is being used on my kindle .
works fine but wish the numbers were larger . just wanted something simple to use and this is it , but the numbers need to be larger .
if you are addicted to bingo games , this is one you got ta have . way too much fun for a single game .
this game feels like you are playing real bingo at the casinos . i 'm really happy i downloaded it . i love it .
my friends and i play this game , it is great and hard but you come out of it with more knowledge then when you went in .
i am unable to give this app a real rating . it was in your apps for the kindle fire hd , but i never received it .
i tried it but some of the jokes are no funny to the people i tried the jokes to . so you need to change some jokes
i really enjoyed this game . story was good , and so we 're the graphics . loved the & quot ; shooting & quot ; mini games for something different . would buy a part two .
i loved this it was so fun to play i just loved it that is all i can say awesome game
used it for wake up while on business , worked great . love the different faces i can use , and light levels .
this app works smoothly and provides all the information at half time and final results of each game . try it next year , it should even be better .
great game to pass away time and fun for the whole family ! we have several of the hidden object games but this one is our favorite !
this app was great . the color and the sound and the hidden objects were a challenge to find it took some thought .
you have to be online to play do not like that at all ! ca n't play if you are somewhere you do n't have wifi .
this is a fun game as most know easy to play and it takes you back to the old days when pac man was a way of life . give it a try ... ... worth the price .
i did n't finish downloading this one since it uses a lot of memory and i only wanted to use it with my grandson for the day so i used the talking tom app instead .
just get it it is the best i love it and it is my first day playing it so get it
this was my first attempt at sudoku and i liked the form very much . it kept my interest and was enjoyable to work . this is good for a beginner to start with .
i love this game so much . i play it all the time when i am bored . i am close to unlocking all the characters . i recommend this game for everyone .
i think this game sucks but you people like it so ya its ok i just do n't like it there 's no point of this game but other games are better
i could n't get this app to load on the kindle fire hd it had beautiful pictures but not able to get them
really enjoy this game . i love that there are special dragons . they cost gems but you can also breed them and save the gems for other items . best game like this that i have played
same as all the gem match three games , but just as addictive . you will have fun whether it 's your first time or you 've played them all .
it 's good but boring ... . new update please ! and to addicting . do not get this game ! because if you get it you will get bord !
i think who ever put one star for this game was completely out of their mind . this game is one of my favorites .
this game is one of the best game i have ever played it keep ur mind going , great great yay
this came in handy when you needed help to solve some levels otherwise you would n't be able to move on .
this was more advanced than i needed . i thought it was for beginners . my mistake , deleted so i could make room for something else .
i enjoy word to word but i have wanted more difficult sets . this theme package does it . now if they 'll just make more .
it is soooo addicting because when you start it helps you out a little and you get to breed and buy your own monsters , and make sick beats
i have not used this app that much but ca n't wait until i need to use it and see how it works . will write a better review then .
good game , v addictive . adds are a bit of a pain but thats the price of it being free i guess
this is one i am glad i downloaded and play often , if you like puzzles give this one a try , fun music and cute graphics : )
this app is a total waste of space . i got this app and it crashed my kindle fire ! do not get this app !
this game is the best game for kids . they will have so much fun playing the this game . when i got it i would not stop playing
i do n't like that you have to buy you energy and hints . otherwise , it 's a good game in that you can pick it up or turn it off and anytime .
i like this game it is alright i rated it 5 stars because i needed an extra help on the game . it is kinda challenging .
i really enjoyed this game ! it was very addictive and the graphics are excellent . the only complaint i had was the lack of instructions on the use of the tools .
until you do n't open an account the access is difficult , you need first to have an account with netflix ! otherwise can be interested to have specially if you are stock in airport !
i was a huge fan of the might and magic series ( a few more too ) . this game takes me back to those good memories . thank you to the dev .
i really enjoy word link . i feel it is challenging to get it the first time . yes , i would recommend it to others . i do think it is a fun app .
i just learned to play this game , the app is helpful for learning strategy , but it is fairly easy to win . a little more challenge would earn this app five stars
i do n't understand . why some bad reviews . been playing every moment i have time . excellent little game . highly recommended . 5 stars all the way
get it get it get it if u have a twitter it is awesome and it works great i think everyone that has a kindle should get one ! !
absolutely amazing bingo game to play when you are allowed free time . i could not think of anything more fun while stuck inside during a snow storm .
yeah , you only get three things for the kids to use unless you buy the upgrade . instead of free should say trial .
oh , i have been playing this gin rummy game way too much since i downloaded it . it is fun and no glitches . it works perfect and so fast . i have really enjoyed this game .
this starts out simple but you quickly have to start using strategy as well as just matching things . challenging and very enjoyable !
does not appear to work one kindle fire hd - wish i had know that before i spend the time downloading to nowhere .
i downloaded this as my screen saver . fun to feed the fish and easy to make changes when i want to . nice hassle free fish tank ... grand daughter loves it .
it 's okay is about right . not a feel good kind of game . lots of bells and whistles but not much else .
the app does n't always load correctly , but when it does i can get lost in it for hours . for the most part i recommend this to anyone who like to just browse the internet .
this is an awesome app if only i could win like some of the other player 's , that would be wonderful . there needs to be more daily credits given out , you go thru them too quick .
love this game . love playing with friends . like keeping sharp on words . like being able to chat as well as play a game .
my sons and i loved playing this . we reached the top level and now are just waiting for more . thanks for good memories .
it 's an interesting game but when you get stuck , you are stuck . no hints or helps that i could find .
loads without problems on my kindle fire . so far i am having fun but i just started as well . i hope it is all it says it is .
a fun game to waste time . some challenging levels . lots of fun if you enjoy bubble pop games . recommend for all ages .
not as much fun as i hoped for . no passes if you ca n't get the answer . so it 's necessary to & # 34 ; buy & # 34 ; coins if your stuck .
this app is also a very good step by step guide and i really love it thanks to the people who made this app
this is a pretty good game for the smaller kids grandkids really like it something i can play with them
i do not like games that make it so , that the only way to play is online . it does not give you a chance to practice .
if you are looking for a time filler , this game is a good choice . only thing i would change is the ability to make screen larger .
what looks like a quick no brainer just keeps getting faster and more difficult and this requires great thought faster fingers .
this game is a lot of fun . i just wish you could skip and go back to when you 're having trouble .
i have removed this app from my device . the app rarely worked right and i just did n't find it worthy of my time .
this is an easy game to play and it is fun if you are not looking for a big challenge .
this game for girls is fantastic ! it 's super easy to get money and cash . the prices are just right and are totally worth it . i ca n't get my face off it . it totally rocks
no stars i do n't care i put 1 i make it 0 it would not come off if you get delete it right away or you will be stuck with it forever ! ! ! ! !
this is one of the best kindle fire apps for a piano ! you can change the keys to make different sounds !
if you love word search games , you have to get this app . very easy to use and you will learn a some interesting facts about other countries . love it !
not sure if i liked it . tried to delete it from my kindle when it mentioned something about buying more levels .
good game with a lot of variety and frequent bonuses . compare to other games this is an excellent idea . really enjoy playing this game
i like it . the push to try to get you to buy coins is annoying but it is a good game .
if you need a reason to buy this game , it 's because you 're clearly interested enough to read the reviews on it . great way to spend $ 0.99 .
you ca n't do anything but look at a single screen . you ca n't swipe to a new one and you ca n't interact with it at all .
this game is so fun and addicting . the spot to move a card to use later makes the game fun . you think you are losing and suddenly you clear the board . highly recommend .
i should have known with such good ratings this was going to be fun . my husband just downloaded it after watching me play .
this is a fun app but too many ads . in arcade mode sometimes you have to close the game and open it again just to see your score . i have to do it every day ! ! !
great but sometimes freezes up . also only gave 5 stars cause i get free coins . still like the game though . needs to be less pricey .
great mind thinking game , even though on some levels i had to look up how to solve it . most are just time in solving .
this game is ok. i play it while i 'm waiting to earn life 's on other games . pretty much the same tasks throughout the game .
great fun game to play . it really works your brain out , and gets you use parts of your brain you didnt know you could use .
i do n't like a lot of the popular games . i prefer the ones that make me think . so far this is simple but fun .
this game is so vivid in color and graphics , love playing it ! very addictive and fun to try and get a higher score , i would of paid whatever was asked to get this app !
this is an excellent game actually one of my favorites the only problem i have with it is it crashes on a regular basis other than that i highly recommend it
addicting game and lots of fun . hard to put down once you start playing . it is better than a lot of the computer versions that i have on my computers .
this helps with reading as well as thinking on your feet . some of the word combos do n't make since at first .
even though the app was free i did n't realize it had so few levels . played them all in no time .
i 'm surprised its not more popular . i use it with my kindle fire and it works awesome . i would rate this one million stars if i could . it is my new favorite game
i love this game ! i play it so much that i have it on my kindle and my smartphone . play daily .
the calculator is nice to have it is very good because it works great but i had to delete it
it okay . its about how fast you can spell and find words . my kids play it often . its a race against the clock .
there are better free games out there with more interesting play . the sound is not very appealing either . do n't bother to waste your time .
i dont see many games on here i think it stinks i dont think its fair that we cant get the same games or close to it as online
great game it made me think something most games do not do . bring on more please . make them even more challenging an longer
it took a little while to get the hang of the game & amp ; now i seem to be hooked . young kids can play the easy levels but the more difficult levels my be too hard .
this app is ok , but does not seem to be as detailed as when i use it on my computer . it works well for what i need it for though .
this is a very fun game . you 'll have hours of fun finding out these cool movie title clues . check it out !
this is a really great match three game . i love getting the egg . i would highly recommend this match three game .
it 's candy crush , need i say more ? fun , challenging , and an all around great way to kill some time . love it ! !
its okay but not the best . sometimes it lags and it gets very annoying ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! : ( overall its okay but still not the best all ever .
just a game to pass the time away . it will make you think before you make your move . all in all a good game
pretty lame game , no challenge to this game at all . it is pretty boring . i deleted it . get a better match 3 game
pretty cool puzzle game . only just started playing it , so time will tell , but do far so good ... i will update if any issues
very cute lets u do lots of cool things ! ! really cute icons ! really cute ! ! good for any ages ! ! ! ! ! ! hope i could help ! ! !
its good but could be a little more difficult other than that its ok so its not bad i think
this is a fun and easy game ... .you will be surprised at how many movies you actually know . a good way to pass time .
it 's a fun game and u have to do a lot of thinking and it gets hard when u get on certain levels

a little expensive ... i like hidden object games , which this was missing . also i could not get the alternative ending to play . : (
my little one plays this app for a little while but there is n't a whole lot to do on this app . it is more for just making noise .
game is ok not additive just ok its worth 99 cents but not much more . will i play it again yea maybe .
this is a nice game to pass the time . it can be as simple or as difficult as you choose .
ca n't seem to put it down , love it ! ! ! such a great time passer ! very addictive . definitely not sharing this game with my husband !

i love solitaire and this is one of my favorites . spend a lot of time on this game . relaxing game to play .
i believe this game got me started on an angry birds addiction . the games are challenging and fun with loads of different backgrounds to keep it interesting .
one good think is you do n't have to worry about . changing the water . i like the different types of fish you can choose from . i think i might keep this game .

this app is lots of fun to play and a lot of cool power ups and sound effects to keep you going . i really enjoy it the shooting is cool too .
the best sleep i have gotten in a very long time its an app that has saved my morning life .
thought the price would give you some other features such as maybe real people but this game is only 99 & cent ; on the apple market .
i have lots of of fun playing this game . i was not to good when i started but i am getting better . it is just a lot of fun
good game maybe not 5stars but giving 5stars to obtain walkthrough . i love escape games so have added to my collection
this game is fun but needs an update with more categories other than that its some good old fashioned fun
this is a good way to stimulate the brain , work on memory skills while having a great time playing this game .

great game . it makes you think . even something simple can sometimes be hard to figure out . i love this game .
this is just a demo so you buy the games . so much is locked it is not even worth downloading .
been waiting for every for it to update the app taking too long to update they need too hurry up but other wise it 's a great app
i guess it 's not my type of game and i end up having to buy hints ? ? ? thats kinda dumb if it 's a free app .
what 's the point of the game it is horrible you never get any dresses or important things that you need on it . why would any body love the not free stuff
i dont have internet at home so it does me no good . it was nice while the little credits lasted , but i just didnt like it enough to keep it .
i really wanted to play this game but again it was another app that would n't install into that stupid android ... .
who does n't love a good find the difference game . i continue to play this game and have n't encountered any issues . would rate higher if it included more pictures to search from .
it great when your not home and you want to watch a movie on your laptop and my kindle fire .
in this version , you can get different bird colors for making reviews , and you can even make your bird poo . : d just as good as flappy bird , maybe even better .
have played quite a few of these types . this game was tedious . too much dialogue for very little game play . did not complete it for this reason .
i enjoy playing this game . objects are hidden fairly well . however , myself i prefer just a little more challenging hog . i got it free so no problem !
very good ho game . i loved it and now my 6 year old is playing . nice variety of puzzle types , story line , and challenges .
it is a awesome game for an american if you are chinese you will not understand why ? you ca n't read the words it is funny !
if you are a curious person like me , and would like to map stars , this would fit !
hard but fun need a way to earn hints and stuff give a little more hint so the person knows or can figure it out
it 's an easy game but it passes the time and is a good way to relax . it 's also fun to play with other
i love puzzles of any kind , but this one is a little different which was a pleasant surprise , ca n't wait to put more puzzle together ... .
i ca n't believe how amazing this game is ! ! ! i have played some good games but this one is my favorite .
this application is fantastic . three words is great to play . i would recommend this game to friends and family . super concept .
old school arcade racing . a blast from the past . i love it . my 3 yr old cousin loves it too !
i can get rid of apps , uninstall , free junk memory and get memory boost , very useful all in one tool
this is a very addicting game . it makes you focus , think , respond . it is simple , easy to use and high quality photos .
i think this game its great . they try to make it like real life somewhat , when you play you might understand that .
this game is the best game ever and i just love it and it makes my life so fun . my mom does n't even know that i have this game .
not bad . you need to purchase hints & upgrades but it can be played without hints . mix of levels of difficulty but mostly challenging .
this is okay it a little hard for little people over the age of five or maybe younger it 's too fast .
awesome totally fun ! i started to play it an i could n't stop ! take my word for it because if do n't u will see what your missing out on ! great time passer & lt ; 3
i really like this version of spider solitaire . it is easy to play , even on small screens , and you can win most of the time .
this game is very fun it 's one of the best games i have ever played but i rated it 4 stars because i think the backgrounds look stupid
one word to describe it & quot ; entertaining & quot ; always something to do i ca n't complain at all download right now . before it 's too late lol
i want to get the new cartoon network app . i want the new app because you can watch video and play games . dont get this app .
i can hardly wait to play it every day . it definitely is challenging and fun . i appreciate the fact that it is a free game .

just right . not super hard and not so easy you get bored . let 's you keep trying until you get it . makes you think , especially when you do n't know the song .

i love pinterest ! it 's a little slower loading on my kindle fire compared to my laptop but i could still sit on it for hours .
i think it 's great ! the games are addicting but that is only because you are constantly trying to beat your previous score . i have noticed some mental improvement . thumbs up !
this game sucks it 's not even fun . there 's no racing all you can do is drive around also it 's very boring and stupid i regimens not to get it ! : (
i check this everyday for the weather and i love it ! i have it on my ipad and my android also so i can check the weather all the time
this is a good game as long as your chips last . i wish there was a way to buy more chips with the coins you win rather than having to buy with real money .

my daughter 's and i all love this game . it gets fast quickly , so it may be harder for younger kids after a while . fun and entertaining .
i downloaded this app for my daughter and she still seems to enjoy it . it is a very cute game and the animals within the game are adorable .
love it . no issues on my kindle fire . lots of fun . if u like where 's my water , you 'll love this game too .
fun to see how long it takes to complete puzzles . it is great for keeping the brain active and have fun doing it .
i really enjoy this game.it has a lot of different and interesting objects . each level has different objects , so much fun
but it crashes on my phone , and was unresponsive with use of swipe controls ... might be just me , or could have just been my phone itself ...
this game is very awesome . they give you chances to get more points by doing certain things . the games cost more points as you increase levels .
great game and very interactive . you do have to use some actual money to continue the fun but if you love music as much as i do then it is worth it !
its caused me to fail but it is a great game i recommend it to you . just to fill space to post
it 's a great game , but it 's a little hard for me because of the 3rd hole . overall it 's a good game but it 's that 1st level 3rd hole .
yes there are a lot of other apps that do the same thing , but skype is still my favorite , for both personal and professional use .
when growing up , i use to love watching the the price is right and still watching it till this day . this app brings back memories and i love playing it .
great game . it really makes you think . i wish there was a hint or clue for when you get stuck .
easy to use on your tablet . much better than using the browser . ability to find and use coupons a real plus .
i loved this game . great graphics , creators please create another one with even more challenges . loved the 3d aspect of it as well . do n't pass this one up .

i am enjoying the game . i find it hard to put down and will recommend to friends and family . great game and it is free .
i am not a good judge of this one . i ca n't give an accurate account of this game if i do n't play it !
do not like the function icons on the puzzle board and the screen moves and the can not sort the pieces to the side all at one time . also the puzzle can not be saved for later .
i cant believe that finally the ad free version of this app is finally free . i was wanting to buy the ad free version but now i can get it free ! thank you amazon

so far ok. about as good as 3. was hoping for more . maybe as i keep playing ... until i get bored . need more options tho .
it 's a fun game to play . the characters are so real looking . the graphics are awesome . i recommend it to everyone .
i have not played this game i probably got it for when my nieces and nephews come over
this is a game you can play and feel like you never really get anywhere . no achievements . it 's just boring !
i love the way this works better than the gallery app . i can see photos in the order that i want to see them in , and it works quickly !
this game is almost addictive . the girls compete playing at the same time . it helps keep peace in the house .

very fun game 8 yrs or older , but items cost too much money for what the people make . also we wanted a big family and cant seem to get one .
this is a wonderful game . each level is a different challenge and every level is totally different . i really get frustrated sometimes playing but in the end i just love paying it .
it seems to take a longer time switching from screen to screen and much more old school slot style . its fun but not so much exciting .
what a great game . i love it . it is intense and fun . i was pleasantly surprised when i first tried it . i recommend it .
this game is awesome 5 star person here i love this game so much i wish for two things only 1 for a new update and 2 i wish it was a bit cheaper
jewels & amp ; diamonds is the newest definition of addiction . great game , graphics are awesome and i am sure that all that play the game will find it just as fun to play as i do .
did not like this game . hard to see the numbers in some places . not clear on some of the instructions .
i enjoy puzzles that are not too complicated , and the free puzzles are just my speed . also , you do n't have to worry about dropping the pieces on the floor !
i 've enjoyed playing this game for a very long time now . keeps your mind going if you 're in a boring situation . works great on the tablet .

i love it . it is so cute you get to do so much stuff and build cool stuff and make your hotel be a success . i rate it five stars it will be worth your while download now
this app is not really meant for the kindle tablet . it is a google app and is somewhat hard to use !

i 'll be getting the paid version after playing this today . not super hard but a challenge that does make you think .
it 's fun but gets kinda boring after a while . it 's fun the first 20 minutes after that , it 's just a time waster .
this works great . i dont have alot of apps on my kindle but this one is a must if you have hbo .
the game is awesome and fun you should try it . it 's sick and some are hard depending on how old you are
just got the kindle fire as an early christmas present and of all the game apps ive downloaded this one is my favorite so far : ) def worth the money
this is a really good app it works very well it has never crashed on me + make your own little movies i recommend getting it !
this game is so short . you only get to do one customer and then the game is over ! i 'm not saying do n't get it i 'm just saying be ready to get disappointed : ( .
great app , i love to take pictures and try to edit them . so this app really helps me out . i love this app totally worth your money .
i really never used to like solitaire until i started playing this game because you can level up and select different kinds of solitaire . i would definitely recommend this game to anybody that loves card games .
i just started and only thing i need is more hints ... .i love these kind of games and hope i can figure it out .
kind of boring to me . i played it once and got bored , so do n't play it anymore . not very exciting .

it a fun trying to get to point to point to make it work , it fun and mind boggling sometimes good job
fun , fast , no long wait for next game to begin . easier to win than other bingo games.i would recommend this game to all who like playing bingo .
it stops on me at times . the app does tend to stop working and you have to reboot the game again .
the app froze about half way through . i was really enjoying it . and i am very disappointed . why do these things happen ?
this game was really cool ! good storyline . awesome graphics . really good puzzles along with the hidden object games . a winner in my book : )
its probably good for people who know how to put it to use . but i dont , i downloaded it and still cant get video on my kindle hd
i ca n't find anything to complain about with this app ; it is easy to use and very useful . a perfect calculator .
this is a fun app especially on a road trip . some of the shows seem a little obscure , as though they are old or were only on cable , but still fun to play .
fun for the holidays , i got it for free . i would n't have paid for it though . but if you have young kids it 's probably a nice book to have
my 5 year old enjoys this game quite a bit . easy to play and understand .
this game looks like it would be fun as i love candy crush but for the life of me i can not get it to open on my kindle ! ! glad it was free
great game and extremely addicting . i do n't know if it 's because it 's free but it is a bit glitchy and the constant advertisements are soo annoying but it 's still fun .

my daughter loves the panda games . they are simple and entertaining . she would want them all if i would be willing to buy them .
all of it is free it has not asked me to & quot ; buy the full version for more content & quot ; its great !

this is a fun game not only for kids but for adults . i like how you can turn the sound on and off also .
it is a fun game the family can all enjoy , and is true to it ` s description as advertised . the fish and scenery are very well done
not really for me . was not what i was looking for . was n't what i expected from a slots program . deleted it from my device .
this app is very frustrating so i can barely focus on the actual game . it freezes a lot and is really annoying . do n't get this app . it is a waste of your time .
it seems like this would be really easy but it gets quite hard . but it is fun and time consuming .
nice job with this one i really like this the best out of all of the angry birds games . very cool .
awesome game a little hard awesome still only one bad thing that you have to buy packs but since its free and o ads definatly worth it
what can you say about solitaire . you either enjoy playing it or you do n't . i enjoy playing it so this is a good game .
the game was ok , but after a while it got a little boring . i 'd still recommend it to anyone who likes the slots , but i deleted it after an hour or so
i could never get ahead on this slot game so i deleted it after 2 weeks of trying it and have n't missed it on my tablet .
i do not use this app daily , but it is another resource among several that i have chosen . no complaints .
easy but you got ta pay for your extra items but other than that its fun to take the time away
i love this app because it is minecraft and i love minecraft it is fun it is great for all ages get this app

it 's ok nothing exciting about it makes the time pass by , needs more to it to make it exciting . thanks
the game played well on kindle fire . no problems and puzzles were challenging . hint and skip buttons work very well and navigation through game is easy to get . price is worth it .
a bit easier on my computer than my kindle but still fun . try it and you 'll probably enjoy it . have fun .
i enjoy playing this kind of game . i wish there were more levels available for free and it did n't end so quickly .
pretty challenging game but really fun it is quite easy on some parts however it can be hard to beat
this is a fun game if you like word games . you learn new words , and play with friends . it 's a easy paced game that you do n't have to rush at .
i 've been looking for something like this since i got my android phone . easy to use . nice design . easier than typing when you need to write fast . overall very useful .
makes you really think about word connections . play it with my 9 year old boys and they enjoy it also .
you need to get more of these type of apps . they are awesome and again a good story line
awesome game . okay graphics , but they are not allowed to show actual peoples faces so i guess that 's why . totally worth it
i really enjoy this game . very cute and somewhat challenging . i only wish that gold was easier to come by without spending money .
i watched ( sometimes helped ) my daughter playing many cooking games and this is so far best on a market . you can actually use these recipes in real world .
this game is so much fun . not only are you building a community of some of your favorite characters , but you also get to play along a story board and play small games in the game .
love this one . it 's not so easy . you can look and look before you finally see it . better than most .
too bad it kept me awake ! new i have to work : p fun . challenging . need more words words words words !
this app is really great i really prefer it over everything else ... but it does n't tell you what the words mean you just kind of have to guess ...

fun game . really enjoyed it . i wish it would of had more content . i unlocked everything pretty quickly . please add more
i love the app there are many amazing stories on this app but i do n't recommend it for anyone under 10
i like this magazine overall , but it 's okay on the kindle . i did n't buy a subscription though because i 'm not that big of a fan of the magazine in general .
this a good and interesting game with a lot of thinking and you feel that you have used your brain
i got it because all my friends have it and liked it but after a while i got bored and deleted it .
great and fun game recommend to get it its really epic game rate 5 stars if it 's not fun to you then you suck
my child played this and wanted a new one so we downloaded it on the kindle for her to play

this game is very simple to play and lots of fun . a lot of puzzles , have never had a repeat yet
i like this game . it keeps me in practice so i can beat my family when we play for real .
my 5 year old loves this game ! i 'm so glad i bought it . it became one of his favorites instantly .
so much fun ... ... ... . if you have money . seriously , this game tricks you into buying stuff so be careful unless you have 10 $
i have always enjoyed rpg games and this is a really good one to play on the kindle i would like more games like this in the future . keep up the good work thanks
perhaps i 'm old fashion but i prefer to read most of my news . 90 % of the news stories on this app are videos .
it does what it is supposed to do if you want to read horoscopes but other than that , its nothing special .
fun game , hate to quit playing but wish coins were n't so expensive . would be nice to play w/ friends even if not a facebook user .
i love this game . it is so addicting . a must have ! ! ! ! i downloaded this game today and i have not stopped playing it . works great on my kindle fire .
wife did n't like it - what else can i say . wife did n't like it - what else can i say .
super easy at first but then it gets into some real obscure movies i 've never even heard of . all in all a fun game
works great and fills the whole screen great app using it all the time and it is free which makes it great
just downloaded this game and am loving everything about it so far . i really like the bonus games when you level up . i 'd recommend playing this to anyone !
this game is an awesome game for people who like hidden object games like this . if you think you should get it , you should n't hesitate about it .
keeps requiring more coins . cute format but overall could n't play more than a few times before they wanted more money for coins to play the game .
this solitaire game has only one card released at a time which i like ! this is very relaxing and i enjoy playing it !
the graphics were very nice , extremely colorful and the story line was fun . the game was well worth the price .
good game . nice graphics . too many pop ups . now that i 've written a review , will you please leave me alone ? !
very addictive . a lot of fun . play it every chance and ca n't stop . going back to playing it now . bye .
this game is okay to play but gets boring after a while and its pretty much the same thing over and over again .
its the same as plants vs zombies . just it sucks . i would recommend that you do n't get this game . even free it sucks
i hate when people complain about their phone not being able to run this game . get a new phone or figure out how to make your phone faster . game rocks .
while it is kind of a cute little game it 's not all that spectacular or original . all i 'll say is i am glad it was free , because i would n't pay for it .
love the app . i have on my computer and glad they have it now for my iphone . it get alot of use .
this game is challenging and fun . its great when you 're really bored and have basically nothing to do . 3 stars
play a minute or quite awhile , it is amazing how the words come together in different ways . i had to have more !
loving this free app ! having to work at getting more games to open up is part of what makes this game fun .
some of it is challenging but all of it is fun , especially if you like thinking games like myself . i recommend this game to everyone especially parents that want their children to learn
i ca n't even get past the enter player name at the very beginning so i ca n't play at all . very disappointing waste of good money .
i loved my atari . this works just fine on my kindle fire . all it takes is a little hand and eye coordination .
good app makes you think ... fun seeing some products that you probably forgot about ... it 's a good game that even the young ones can play
this game is a lot of fun for everyone and you can see what i mean when you play this game too .
works good for what we need it for . a nice alternative for not having a you tube app and has some nice features you tube does not have .
the software is great with the way it works but the font is a little small and nearly impossible to read when it against a black background .
this game is okay . not that fun to play , and to unlock any thing more than the basic characters and colors , you have to pay money .
i love playing phase 10 so this is perfect for when i do n't have others to play with or if i 'm waiting somewhere to pass the time .
i did not care for this - i kept getting stuck , and the only way to move on was buy something .
this is a great app for exercising my brain . i probably prefer the flow game without the bridges , but this one is also very good .
as you can see i love to play bingo games . when i was younger i went to bingo games at my aunt 's at her church .
fantastic game if you need to pass the time . i got it for free from amazon 's free app of the day program , but it 's worth the $ 0.99 !
it 's fun for my little grandson on a car trip , but it is not educational . anything with trains grabs his attention .
i found this application helpful . it covers good basic chinese . my friend has noticed the improvement in my chinese skill .
with this app i have a lot of fun with my friends and its free so you have nothing to lose . get it .
great game , fun for all ages , extremely addicting . i would 've paid more for it . love it , love it , love it ! ! ! ! !
this game was ok at the start , but then things got harder . not enough hints . had to ask for help to play .
awesome game so glad that this game was made it is very smart and well made ! challenging and very fun !
i like playing solitaire and i like the variety that this app provides . i wo n't get bored and not use it much
great application . does everything i need it to be . i really like the short cut . i also like to see my credit rating monthly . i highly recommend this application for those that have discover accounts .
i have n't played yet but if its like doodle god its going to b fun so i hope you guys play
one of the better versions of freecell i 've played . i would definitely recommend this game to others . you can easily get lost in this game .
really do n't like as much cause i am too dumb to figure out all the angles necessary to finish a scene correctly .
this is a great game the really tests your reflexes . on the fire it is a bit touchy at times but over all it is a wonderful way to pass time in a boring meeting . : )
i 'm a huge minecraft fan and i love my kindle fire . but this app is n't nearly as good as the pc . its fun for awhile but gets boring .
amazing and fun . great to play and easy to win . great game . under world is very fun . i cant describe how good it is .
so far this is a very awesome game . it can be challenging at some parts and easy at others . i recommend it .
i 'm glad they finally got it for kindle . only problem i have is that the kindle 's version is behind on the latest updates .
well , well , well , this is just asking to get your device screen broken . not a wise decision my friend . nope .
brain gems is a lot of fun . it makes you think and learn new words . i highly recommend it . it 's good exercise for the mind .
get lost in space with angry birds space . very fun game , if you like angry birds , you 'll love angry birds space .
great game love it , very addicting . ca n't stop playing it . this is the hardest app to put down . thank you .
this is a fun and addicting game . i cant stop playing it ! i love it and recommend it to everyone .
exactly i expected , and kinda love it a lot and overall its a great way to waste time . try it !
i like it as you can talk quite a while and it translate it well .
i love slots and bingo games so yes this one is on my list . i just started playing this app so i 'm staying with 3 stars for now .
this game is just like the arcade game . i have found no problem with software . i get many hours of play time . it has been very entertaining .
skype comes in and sends my image as good as my computer . only used it a couple times so far .
flappy wings is addicting . i just ca n't stop playing it . i have been playing it all day and i ca n't beat my high as score ! !
this is the best app ever ! ! ! there is a website also . i would recommend this for everyone . and all ages
i can go back to this game over and over . it is interesting and holds my attention . i like the different story parts .
i have played this game once . my hubby like the variety of games that it offers . i am not sure how many coins are given daily .
glue games are so fun been playing this on my ipod for a while now great quality game for free .
i expected more from this game since i own zuma in my computer , but is not the same , i get bored easily
have played a lot of bingo games , and this one is one of my favorites . can not put it down . if you have n't tried this game your missing out ... ... ..
this is s great game for the brain in using relaxed fun game play . you will be hooked ! i have it on two tablets that i use . runs really good
this is an okay game you should try this game hope you will like playing it hope this helps you to get it or not have fun
its pretty fun . kinda difficult when i have no idea what the tv show is . its a fun game though .
sadly , this is a very boring game with almost no challenge . gameplay , graphics , and much of the dialogue are all weak . i do not recommend purchasing this game .
i love this game it makes me feel like i 'm at the beach and makes me feel relaxed even if i am just sitting there
temple run is finally in the app store . really fun game always is really fun . best game i ever played .
not easy to use , still working on it . it would be very nice if it was easier . still working on it .
i installed it , but wants a credit account before it 's use . that might be a nice thing to put in the app 's description .
i just could n't get into it . i got it just to try it , but i doubt i 'll play it much .
solitaire has always been one of my favorite classic games . i would like to see the other versions of it also offered on the kindle though .
just like the going to the fair ! goes a little slow if you do n't use iap but getting to higher levels on your own is still fun .
there was a great flow to this game , i could n't put it down and finished in a day . the hints and strategies areas helped a ton !
i like the game but the levels are very long . i like the puzzles and such . this app makes you work
i love the game it is so much fun for me and my family because it is so much fun to watch and to play it over and over again
the game is fun and simple . need big wins to make it even better . the level up and hourly coins is awesome .
having a blast but need more free bucks ! ! ! would like to play more with more free bucks more often that would help : )
great to have every one should should get this and try it good to have on your kindle it is a great item
good game but clues are too expensive for as slow as you earn game cash . a bit of a challenge when there are so many possibilities .
this is a fun app that covers all kinds of horoscope things . a fun little diversion on my kindle and for free it was great .
fun . i enjoy the out of the box thinking required ! the player is given plenty of time to work out the puzzle .
you ca n't even make your own city it 's built for you and you ca n't even make the city bigger this app is lame
pretty fun and addictive . do not need internet . i gave it 4 stars because i play a lot . very addictive .
maybe i am not good at it . i would really like to figure out how to make more complicated patterns
seriously loved this one . new twist to point and click adventures . really just a big old box of puzzles ... except so interesting !
i liked the game but it was too short for the price . looking forward to other games , and hopefully it will be worth the money spent .
one you half to be on the internet to play bad for me 2 it does n't really do much i know i did n't play it long was boring
have played all levels on easy with my kids , now going back as a challenge on a harder difficulty . nicely executed .
i am liking this one . i love hidden object games . the ghosts appear and disappear in this one . the objects are not too hard to find .
this game is awesome . i had this game for 12 years . my brother plays it and my sister plays it .
the text messages dont go through fast enough and when you get a reply its the next day and it dosent even make sense please please please fix this or why text on this program
if you like puzzles this is a good one . you have to really use your brain and memory . i found it enjoyable .
i really like the app , it can be read by yourself or with the audio , the person reading has a soothing voice . overall good app .
i have always like doing crossword puzzles and this is no exception . when i need a break from other types of entertainment , i usually go to this .
i love these kind of games ! it works great too . i think the clarity is great too . give it a try !
the game is alright but every time i win the game stops and i would have to do the race again .
fairly easy but is fun ! it 's very entertaining and would definitely recommend it to everyone . i say , nice job to the creators !
i thought that this was a good game for older two year olds . thought it was a little hard for new two 's .
i 'm finding this game to be more of a challenge than some of the games i 've played . i 'll be looking for more games by this creator .
my grandchildren downloaded this into my kindle when they were visiting . it is something i would never use and therefore have probably deleted it from my kindle .
great little game to play while watching tv or while riding in the car . it keeps you guessing as to the next move .
this stinks . it is n't real and does n't look real at all . get this if you wan na be stupid otherwise do n't get it .
it 's an ok game but i think it 's more geared for children than adults . it 's pretty good if you do n't want to do much thinking .
it 's easy to use and big numbers help a lot . and i got it for free . what else can i ask for ?
this game was pretty good i think that little girls will like it out is cool for other kids and adults too
enjoyable & oh yes it did n't cost me a penny . i was able to play & not worry about running out of cash like the other games
i like this one better than the candy swipe game , but its still not candy crush saga ! ! ! but its fun to play to pass the time .
when i had my computer i use to play all the time . now i have my kindle fire and now its on and popping !
i 'm going to enjoy following the reading of the bible text when i get into the daily habit . it 's a problem to just read but to be able to follow while being read to is exciting .
did not use is because after download did not realize i had to pay for items to play the game .
great way to keep in touch with friends and family . actually have family on facebook that i met thanks to facebook .
a good game . challenges your math skills , makes you think , and if you hate math like me or not good at it , this is a great game to help improve those skills .
found this difficult to use , and there are not current books that i 'm interested in . maybe down the road it will be better .
this game is very bad . you just talk to a guy who does n't understand a word your saying . plus who cant even see anything . do not get this app .
wonderful game very addictive . i love big fish games . you are the best in my opinion . keep up the great work .
lots of great information . can check all sorts of weather in my area . convenient and easy . shows day and night along with storm info .
i have n't used it yet but it seems to be a very helpful feature . once i get used to using it , im sure it will be better than paper !
i love this game ! i play it all the time ! ! ! i would reccomend this game to every one of all ages ! ! ! ! ! !
this is the same as on my smartphone . the app seems like its pretty good , have n't come across any problems yet . just wish i had the kindle with a camera lol !
i was new to kindle and i loaded several different types of games to play . this one did not keep my attention so i removed it from my kindle .
very boring app ! do n't waste your time getting this app because its not worth it . there has to be better apps out there than this !
this app did n't work on my four year old sons tablet i tried to reset it and it still would n't work so i uninstalled
i love this app ! it has so many games in this one app . the only thing i do n't like is the ads but an overall awesome app
my 6 yr. old granddaughter says she loves this one & # 34 ; because you can make matches and stuff and it is really fun ! & # 34 ; : )
love this game ! if you play it right , you can play for hours ! puts a new spin on hidden object games ... very addicting ! !
very fun and difficult at times . better than the first one by a whole lot and very epic and awesome .
you guys make it so old fashioned looking , not very exiting and its kinds hard some of the games so
the games in this package are pretty good . not too easy but not too hard either . interesting patterns and entertaining .
my kids loved this little game and learned how to play tic tac toe really good ! a must have for little ones learning how to play without all the paper .
this game is boring and way too hard not fun especially for younger kids because if you jump your horse practically always gets hurt
one of the funnest apps out there if you love music & amp ; playing with family & amp ; friends via facebook ! download this one you will not regret it .
i love pou it is a wonderful game and is super fun to watch it grow ! kids should get this app 100 % ! ! ! !
i do n't have an email a dress but i play it on my mom 's phone and i love it i think it should be 13 and older
this is a fun game . keeps the mind working . i know i am not that good at it , but it is enjoyable .
its a fun game so far but i cant figure out if can move buildings so had to uninstall to fix placement errors
i think this is a fun app . i wish i had more options on difficulty levels , but that is the only thing i would change .
this game is fun and helps pass time . i like how there are challenges to accomplish and scores to beat .
this is a fun game ! it worked for me and its kind of confusing but at the end it was true
the game itself is fun , but without a save feature the game is not worth anything . graphics are ok and the create your own story aspect is interesting .
g5 i am really happy with the games . the graphics are great and the puzzle are challenging i love a good challenge .
this is a great and basic bingo game for my kindle fire . i like that each day you are given a daily reward in case you 've ran out of coins .
i really like to play slot machine games this one is a lot of fun to play the best game i have played in a long time give it a try
very simple easy to play many categories and levels of difficulty . best of all it 's free with no glitches on my kindle fire .
i purchased this to download large library of information . it works very well and i am able to study and use the material .
i have this on my phone and i play on everyday . and have it on on the kindle fire but anyway this game is awsome bye yeah ! ! ! & lt ; 3
many of the key functions i wanted do not work on the kindle hdx 7 very disappointed not so much in the software but the kindle
this was a free app so i thought i would try it . i find it unresponsive at times , not easy to use and not very intuitive . i will be removing from my kindle .
this app is great for catching up on all my shows i just love . i recommend this app to everyone .
lots of screens & never boring ! can not compare with some of the other slot games - this one is very exciting !
like the app . for bored on a snow day at work with no business coming in so we all downloaded this app and ran around the store playing . we had a blast .
but i think u should try it is fun and free and if you dont like it just delete it . once again nice game . ; )
the pictures were nice but i had to just tap around my screen to find some items . some were very small and hard to find .
it was not very fun or entertaining . it also glitches up a lot so you have to restart it often
this game really brings the walking dead to life for you . i love the story line . i am so glad i have this game .
this is my 9 year old girls favorite app of all time . it is making her want to ride real horses !
great app , great developers from what i can tell . you 'll agree it 's worth getting . does what it says very well .
i got this to get a player for my tablet but i found another one that i liked so i went and deleted this one .
this is a great game with amazing every thing . very fun and great multiplayer . i would recommend it to every one .
not even close to quality of spider on my desktop . hard to select & move cards on screen . options minimal .
i got this app for my granddaughter and it is the cutest app . give this one a try . you will see as i have how even as an adult u will like it . very cute
great game and fun to play ! lots of people that i know play now . like to be able to chat too : )
this is the first game on my android that i actually try to find time to play . it 's fairly addicting .
i have another version that i like better than this one ! so i play this version only occasionally . it is free .
it is a great app , gives a lot of different sets of layouts , works as it should be . the 3d its very interesting but sometimes a little bit confusing .
i love this game ; it works really well on the kindle fire and its really addicting ! i recommend this game to everybody !
this game is ok but i would like one that the hints were better because i do n't know half of the logos .
i did n't use it much but it was just confusing . after i just got text plus . so go get a better talking game .
easy to get lost in . this game is definitely addicting . ca n't just play one round at a time . i would 're recommend if you need a time killer
i have all types of educational games , apps , books , etc for my now 3 year old and this still does not hold his interest .
so far no crash , works better than old one . fast browsing , very nicely set up . so far no problems . very happy .
this one was removed shortly after installation . do n't waste your time . the play is boring and sluggish . hated it . try another .
i love the background music -- very calming . the game itself i have n't quite figured out yet , but it 's worth looking into .
one of the most fun and realistic bowling games i have ever played . graphics are great and the pin action is superior to anything i have seen ! great game !
app is great and easy to use . makes life easier when you are using your device and need to be on time ! highly recommend it for daily use .
you get to take care of your own horse ! ca n't get any better ! best horse app ever made free ! i recommend this app to anyone
i enjoy playing this when i find some time on my hands . i must admit i am not real good at it , though .
so awesome ! i wish i could play this all day long because it is sooooooo awesome that 's y i wish i could play all day . get this app !
hello it was a very good game and was quite addictive also it had good graphics i really liked it
this game would be great but you constantly have to buy chips just to play . it says free but it 's not !
i am almost to the end . what 's next ? i guess i will try stack the states . it showed me how little i know about geography .
always watch abc at home so like being able to take it with me for my news fix . all the headlines and fun news too .
quite an entertaining little game . a good one if you do n't want to have to think a whole lot . . .and everyone needs a chance to just unwind for a bit !
i have only used this app a short while , but have found it easy to use and very helpful on my fire .
i love pinterest and this app works great on my kindle fire ! pinterest has something for everyone . i highly recommend this app .
hey i 'm looking at all the comments on this app ... .it looks great ! ! i hope it is ! ! lol i need more words for this comment !
i do n't usually like hidden object t games but this one is an exception . you are racing against the clock to find the items . i like the story line as well .
it does what it 's supposed to do . a simple calculator . there 's not much too say . if you need a calculator this is it
its a great time to play with . very fun and gets progressively challenging . plenty of stages that will keep you interested .
love it everyone should have it ! and it was free ! it is a awesome game and i was sooo addicted to it !
i love watching old movies and shows . this app has shows on it that other apps do not . i ca n't wait to watch more .
i do n't think i had the patience to get this fully installed . i 'll try it again in the future days .
wonderful game . my kids grandkids and i all love this one . it definately gets harder as you go along ! fantastic
yet another fun game . it really uses my memory and makes me think . i really enjoy playing . i really enjoy it .
game is fun but i 'm having problems logging into my facebook to share stuff and i 'm missing out on a lot of crystals
i like having this game it is easy to play i love it i have been playing it since i got it
it 's okay as word search games go . i had to take it off because it take up too much memory .
this is a simple but addictive game . it 's just like the block game i grew up with on my apple desktop computer . i love it and would recommend it to anyone .
ordered this app for my kindle . i have been using this for about 3 months . this app is a must have for any kindle .
my kiddos love it and never get bored ! since kindle fire does n't have a my little pony app , this is the alternative !
ok it is a bingo game , fine for something to do for those who like bingo it is a fine one .
it 's a simple concept , that grows more complicated as you progress . it is a mind game , not a skill game . enjoy .
better to watch him on tv than to sit and read his comments in written form . there much better that way .
lots of fun . the game is interesting . but i wish you could get to all the levels with out having to pay for each one .
this is an awesome game . it has cool graphics , you can play with your friends , it gets more challenging , and it has funny music in the game .
after . figuring . out . how well worth the price . keep making . them although could . have . a little . better . guide . to how to play
i like the app . what i do n't like is they copied super mario and put the same pipes . the app is fun
this is a nice game and its free i my boy says yes cool love it lol you can do it too its free .
i have n't played checkers in 40 years and it was fun to play again without having to look for an opponent .
if you looking for fun this is not good . even with my stylus pen the does n't always go where you want it .
this was another game that gave only one option to get points . i would have had to purchase points . to expensive for my taste for a game where you do n't win real money .
this app is awesome and is soooooo much fun and the new update where it gives you a free new gun every day
very fun game for the whole family . easy controls , no glitch at all . definitely a fun free game for all !
beautiful colors and interesting story . loved it where is the third ? this was not an easy game by any means , but very good .
it 's a great game . always have me thinking and have me on my toes . i will so recommend this game to people who like ago think .
my only words that i have to say are these : awesome ! one of the best calculators ever ! this is a truly amazing calculator
i like this solitaire game a lot . it 's fast and its a fun mindless pass the time by kind of game .
i have only gotten through a few levels so far . it is a fun game . worth the money to upgrade it . graphics are really good . fun for any age or skill level .
that game is very picky . i don & quot ; t understand . so i say don & quot ; t get the game it is the worst game ever . it should be a 0 star .
fairly good game ... it does try to get you to spend money on upgrades and such fairly often which gets annoying . overall , it is fun and a good way to pass the time : )
it says that it will talk in another language for you but it does n't it says the same thing just in english . very big waste of time and money .
i guess i just like pen and paper when it comes to a journal . there was n't anything wrong with the app , it just did n't suit me .
hi i just got this app i 'm at 2 ... .. its pretty good i guess . and its free so yea . any way i hope u enjoy so have fun .
this game is so much fun . i 'd like to play more games like it . it 's a little hard with out clues .
i downloaded it and it downloaded really slow ! then it is hard to jump and turn ! i do n't recommend it but that is just my opinion !
i like this game a lot . the graphics are great and so many objects to find , never a dull moment . the scenes are the best .
5 star game but really hard . great time waster . picked it up today and still super bad . still good fun .
awesome game . good graphics and interesting . themes . fun to play with kids and keeps you thinking . you never know where the next piece is and will that solve the puzzle ?
i downloaded this app and all it did was erase the progress on the original star girl , and sync with that . not happy .
i really am enjoying this game . my only comment is that i would like it if i could play without wi-fi . but other than that , very nice .
i ca n't seem to put it down . i love my new addiction . this game is fun to play and i find myself spending tons of time . give it a try !
after a few time , i found that i would close this game to look for my other game that is similar but a lot more fun to play
one of my favorite apps for my tablet . i 've tried many other casino type games , i do n't like the chat rooms . this app has amazing smooth graphics . highly recommended .
it was ok for something to pass time . it was free so i 'd get it again . need more words to submit
this is a fun word game if you like text twist or boggle you may like this game too ! lots of fun !
just can not get it to open or work . am going to remove from my inventory . if i ca n't play it do not want it taking up room on my kindle .
i like this kind of guessing / logic games . they are very good although the background can be confusing at times .
fun game but addicting ! love that i can change backgrounds and card faces . every once in a while i do have to delete from my kindle and reinstall . works fine other than that .
seems to be interesting , i only wish it gave you more to play on than having to buy something , i recommend it to everyone .
i was hoping to have more than one free cake to make . disappointing that pretty much everything costs money . i wo n't be wasting app space to keep this game .
my 2 year old loves it . the quick , short activities keep her focused and happy . another great monkey preschool game .
i really like this app because it is really funny . it is great for kids and teens and adults alike . i highly recommend this
sorry , it held my interest or about 5 minutes and then became very boring . i would n't purchase it ever again .
it 's ok. did not like how some objects were behind the ads , had to use a hint to find it .
the gameplay is smooth and although the levels get more and more challenging the game is somewhat fun and enjoyable .
i am always checking my account , so i got this app for my new kindle fire and it works great for constantly checking your account status .
to easy ... and when it comes to timed events , you can tap on object 3 or 4 times without the game scoring the find . no wonder this is free .
fun to check the day and compare it with what actually happens . pretty accurate . keep up the good work . thanks .
this is a fun addictive game a good game to pass the time . never boring , always fun . i really enjoy this game
i love this game . i love the fact that it is only 60 seconds a game and that you try to get as many bingos as you can in that one minute .
this is a pretty fun app . it 's really easy at first but the difficulty of the puzzles get higher . i like it .
this game and cartoon wars 1 and 2 are the best games in the amazon appstore ! ! ! i love this app !
the game does have some bugs and can occasionally have problems loading . other than that i really like this one . you can get through the whole game without spending more money on it unlike other games .
ok game , i 've done these before , but needs more free stuff before you have to pay . i 'm just cheap .
this was a typical find the objects game with a few other puzzle types on each level . not too hard but fun to play .
it did n't work as well as i had hoped and i 'm one for car games . i was highly disappointed and deleted it within the week .
really good app . i love the music that i am able to download . i would reccommend this app to everyone .
i enjoy playing farm games because they are never dull . there is always a new situation and different things to do .
from the graphics to music game is very well put together . it is similar to cut the rope game , but with its own this twist on game play and puzzles .
i could n't tell you about how this game plays , it would never load on the kindle so that 's my only problem
tried the free app and thought of buying him the full app . it was really worth it . try it because its a great learning tool for your kid
i could n't get it to work , so i deleted it . i have other and better word search puzzles . i do n't recommend it .
love the game and the concept , like that you can play holiday games or seasons , some are very hard some are fun and easy
when it looks way better in the pictures than it does in real life . i thought it would be kind of the same pictures but it was completely different
this is not a normal calender and still have not quite figured it out .
all the tools that the game gave you were useless . it seemed like there was no way out . not a good strategy game .
this game will not let me get off of the first game . i am suppose to be on level 4 but i ca n't get there . i am stuck on other than that the game is fun .
my husband got me into this game and i play it often . maybe too often . but its fun so far
i like that it is cloud notes . i have quick access to notes that i took , and the cloud helps
i 've only used this app a few times since i downloaded it , but it works fine on my tablet and i have no complaints . can definitely recommend it .
i love it because i can watch and keep up with my favorite tv shows and movies on my phone .
allows me to get wonderful photos straight from my kindle fire hdx . i have tried other camera applications and this is the best one yet .
this is a pretty cool and practical app . i definitely recommend it . this the reason that i do n't do reviews , i do not want to be told how many damn words i have to write !
very simple and easy to use . finally a way to organize your books on the kindle fire hd . keep up the good work .
my daughter spent about 40 dollars for gems in one day keep an eye on your children when using this app
a good stress reliever . makes you concentrate on something else . really nice pictures . like that you can make them as easy or difficult as you want .
rather confusing at first but you can catch on pretty fast . can be addicting too . sometimes you really have to watch a lot of things at the same time .
i liked this and so did most of my family . will you put more games on it though , because i 'm almost done .
this is fun fun fun i do n't like spelling a lot but it 's fun u can play against friends so fun try it free
an okay game . too hard to get some levels have to rely too much on friends to advance . other than that fun
this plays very same as the pc version which i have played for years . the only problem i have is occasionally with the touch screen on my kindle fire hd .
this is a very fun and enjoyable game . by rating it i 'm unlocking the other bird colors . but this game is truly great .
i love that i get a text on my kindle , android phone and ipod . no matter what i 'm using , i can respond immediately . thanks
i like it because it has big heads and you get to pick you level and you can put it on very hard
seriously does n't even let you play dominoes like you would normally so do n't download it you will just end up deleting it .
nice game the game is great simulation realistic guns nice effects just awesome just awesome just awesome just awesome just awesome just awesome
i was disappointed that there were so few levels . i expected more . i think that this game should have been described as one for children as it really was not very challenging .
it 's a cool neat game , just like any other escape type game . but it keeps your mind active . i like it .
i enjoy solving these puzzles . they work on my kindle with no problems . they could be longer though . i recommend trying them .
a nice game to have if you have lots of time to kill . nice options but i dont like the ads which pop up suddenly . they are quite annoying .
i enjoyed doing puzzles . after a few games , i looked up who wrote them because some of the clues were odd to me .
its really fun for when you 're bored . eh , you have to spend money like other games on some things but it is n't that bad .
the app is great to have and i use it often since i use the kindle fire before and after work . gives all the weather information i need .
it was good at first then after i bought it they removed the police from my city what a rip off
crashes after one goal every time . except the first time , got ta clear data to play , seems like pass n play works , but i hope they fix it . i will update my review once fixed
fun & amp ; not too challenging , a bit slow & amp ; unresponsive but overall acceptable play on my 1st gen kindle fire .
needed a app for driving directions gps not any help or was this app . deleted it still looking for a good free app
love this game . keeps me thinking . i think i 'm addicted . i enjoy the variety of pictures and ca n't seem to put it down .
this game made me waist 7 dollars i wanted to take this game to my school and do everything like that but this this is a bunch of bull crap
although we do n't get video games very often for our family , and when we do they are educational , this product is interesting and good to keep you going .
just started playing this game . it has been decent so far . would recommend if you are ok interested in this type of thing .
it is a really fun game . me and my husband like to see who can get a higher score , so it 's fun to play together .
great game ! app runs very smoothly with no issues at all . it has lots of options to customize how you want to play
good app ! easy to use and available when you need it . i was looking for something i could grab quickly and easy to find when needed , this works .
it 's great my 18 month old grand son loves it and i enjoy it also along with my other three grand kids . they do n't even need to know how to draw .
this game is so fun to me you should get it and play so much i will tell everybody about this game .
it is really funny i love it i mean not all of them are great but some most of them are really funny ! ! !
this game is fun . you win often and the bonuses are cool . my kids love playing it to ! thank you for a great game .
great game , pretty fun , its like minecraft , but your world does n't save so you cant make a house or anything , but there are cool places like hell and a sky world , so its ok
this is a very interesting and fun game . it keeps your interest . the only thing that i did n't like was when i got into the game , i had to buy the full version to continue .
i love this app ! the ads get annoying a lot . get this application ! best app ever . buy ! buy ! buy ! i love this app !
i enjoy the challenge of this game . just wish that for everything you do you did n't have to keep paying .
fast paced and fun . you have to be quick on this game or you get left behind . it is hard but fun i think it is very challenging .
i play this game almost every day . it helps to test my brain and stay alert . however , i do think the & # 34 ; game & # 34 ; wins too often . lol lol
this app is a lot of fun . you could sit for hours playing . it is a really fun app . you should get this app .
i did not really expect too much , but wow ! ! ! ! this is really a fun game ... .i recommend it if you like shooting stuff ! ! ! !
i love doing the angry bird games . after i get them all i go back and try for 3 stars .
the game is a lot of good fun but the graphics seem too small on my kindle .
i love it . i feel like i 'm actually on the show . the questions are n't that hard so you can have hours of fun .
great game . very challenging and when you think you have beat it there is another box to beat . awesome cant wait to download part 2 .
typical puzzle game with great controls . really i think the fact that you do n't have to put your finger over the puzzle is quite innovative .
it 's not the same game as on my computer , which i do enjoy playing and i actually play against old friends .
this is a fun game . easy to get going on . i would recommend this to anyone that likes doing games on their tablet or phone .
totally fun game . very addicting and challenging . i would buy it if i did n't already get it free . strategy game
could not get rid of the music so i deleted it off my kindle . did not play an entire game .
awesome game , just like my farkle at home with a few twists . would recommend anyone who has played farkle before to download this one .
kids love to play this game . i think it is a fun game too . good for working on problem solving skills .
i like card games and this is another good app for my kindle to use . i enjoy doing this a lot
no comment . if you ca n't say anything good about a program do n't say anything at all . i need four more words to finish this .
i have tried several weather apps and i found the weather channel to be far superior . almost all my family uses this app .
i really love this game .. it passes by time i just wish it had even more games for more fun
i 've just started the game . have been looking for a good game . hopefully this is it . it seem very interactive as far as these games go . nice graphics .
play on my kindle fire every opportunity i get ... great way to get my stress level down . i highly recommend this app to everyone
this app is totally addictive . i can play for hours . the monsters are too adorable . you never know what they are going to look like .
fast , colorful , and addicting . keeps you playing . i wish there were other ways to earn gold and lives besides paying more .
this is the most informative and accurate weather app out there . i trust and am extremely happy with the wonderful precise information .
they added more to this game than the other one . you have heroes and you can do more cool stuff
its alright not really i thought you could cut hair and stuff total waste of money people on the game get mad to fast
this is a cute fun little game , fun for all members of the family , young or old glad i got it !
have fun and try these games - do n't buy more than you can afford to lose as tokens can be expensive
earn extra tiles with a good review . i like this game because it really challenges you in the upper levels . definitely get your money 's worth in fun play .
this is a good app . i like taking care of my tom cat and dressing it up . good to pass time
but i am also a beach lover . however you should know it 's the same old scenes and sounds and it is very repetitive .
i really like this because it 's quite easy to customize to your liking . it 's accurate and it works and its free . and that 's great .
i had to try and think of all the phrases i knew . after you get one you want to keep going
additive , i love this game , it has taken forever for the crush to come out and now that it 's on my kindle i live for the next level .
i love this app and its just like any town building games it 's graphics are amazing and it 's has a great story to it
i love this game it makes u really think about what word u need 2 put down . the timer makes it fun . you should really get this game .
i ca n't put it down just have to make my town bigger larger the way i want it , about to go play it now since i talked about it ! ! !
another mahjong game . its fun , not different than the others just the pictures on the tiles . free app of the day .
this game is fast paced and fun . it is also beautiful and exciting . i recommend this game to everyone who like to be amazed .
i really enjoyed looking for the items . this is a challenge to locate the items . i really enjoyed playing this game .
i had a good time playing this game . it seemed to be a longer than normal hidden object game and i really liked that .
this is a fun game that has several levels of difficulties for each picture that you search . some are easier than others , but it is enjoyable for anyone who likes this type of game .
good game . keeps your brain alert . i have always enjoyed the challenge mahjong offers . have recommended this game to friends .
i actually am enjoying it more than the original farm mania - levels range from easy to challenging but not so hard as to be frustrating .
there should be a way to get the solution if you get stuck , otherwise it 's a waste of money if you ca n't move on .
one of the best games on my kindle . i play it everyday . i do wish they would add different words . or make it so we could buy others , like on the phone version ! !
this game is fun but there is so many old songs i never heard . i 'm interested in knowing all the songs no matter how old they are . : )
so many informative features and games all in one . had this on my nook and have added it to my new kindle fire .
love this game i have gotten bingo almost every time it is a great game can not wait to unlock other places
had great variety with puzzles . a good puzzle game that kept me playing at least . the room searches were my favorite
this app is horrible , not even worth it . i downloaded it and the game was boring . do not get this app .
seems to be a pretty good game . i have just started it but i 'm enjoying it very much . i love word puzzles !
i 've been playing this along with restaurant story and farm story : ) i just ca n't get enough ! maybe i 'll try another story later
good game though i got stuck on first one , lol . but so far so good . i would recommend it to pass time
great app for kindle but samsung phone hard to scroll up and down on the hourly part of the app . otherwise a good app
it would constantly stop working and nothing would be there for me to go back to so i finally gave up and erased it off my kindle .
same hbo right at your finger tips . especially if you have a fave show . i use it to watch true blood ! ! !
played through on the hardest settings the first time . less than 15 minute 's to complete entire game . if you are over the age of 12 , keep moving .
enjoyed playing all games . i but this on my kindle and it works great . i would recommend this package very much
would not install . i tried multiple times to get the app to install . it constantly kept giving me the same error . so since i could n't enjoy the game my rating is low .
it 's ok to have , but i discovered that i do n't really use it . so i really to have anything for or against it .
the ads in this game spin in and out of the center of the screen . it gave me a headache and i did n't finish the first game . i 'd rather pay than have this annoying game .
it was fine before the update now need yo delete and each time i want to play . kind of a pain
cute game .. free ... makes time go bye fast . lots of fun and easy to play . fun for kids and adults .
angry birds is so fun it cheats a little bit but other than that its great i love it : - )
very cool game . i came across it while playing paper toss . very challenging and just simply a blast to play . i love it !
this is another good learning tool that is fun for the kids . my grandson is 3 and i have quite a few games and puzzles on my kindle for him and he loves this one .
i use this app on a daily basis , and can see an improvement each time . i recommend using it to improve the performance on your kindle .
not as good on this game , i guess i do n't watch enough television , for those who do it would be a fun game .
my kids love the game to play that . they play it almost everyday now . it 's really fun to playing and funny .
just started using , and so far it 's okay . have n't taken the time to try all the features , so i ca n't comment .
it did n't work for me . i did n't focus enough on it . probably would have been more successful if i had started sooner .
what 's wrong with you this game is epic how long have you been playing this game ! ! if you had been playing longer you would say it 's epic to
this game is fun and challenges even the best . if you like cards and using your brain , then you will love this game . have fun playing !
i love this app ! i use it all the time . could be a little faster , though . i 'm glad its free . : )
this was my favorite story growing up some 20 years ago , now i can share it with my 2 year old daughter who loves books . there is no better feeling
i love this game . the best part is that they have regular movies and animated movies in different categories . very addictive .
i love word games . this one 's ok. not as interesting as i had hoped , and some of the associations are not all that accurate .
this game is fun to play and has some pretty cool scenes . i like that you have to look for clues and search for things and they do n't make it overly easy .
i enjoy this game very much . it helps me pass the time by . i recommend trying this game out . end
best game ever ! ! ! i mean it good that it teach you how to draw stuff but it take less step than i should .

i love this game . the free app is a great way to get to play it . the skill level is good for casual play .
i have always loved these games . very fun , like the challenges they give you . good game to play to pass the time .
if you get the app to make it better than the it will take a lot of time to download
quite challenging . i ca n't stop playing . i really enjoy this game . you should have more games like this one . it is also educational .
this game is awesome the first time i got this game i really liked it i think everyone should get it . : )
this game . good for little kids like 5 years old my little sister is addicted to this game . this game is kind of like flappy bird
really good and also addicting i play it alot and has alot of cool items too buy in the store
this game is great . alot of fun and not dull like other bingo games . just wish there were more free chips a day so i could play longer .
played the entire first season on console , and bought the season pass for kindle . there are no glitches , the game has amazing performance on kindle hdx , and the story is just plain awesome .
this app does what i have been using several other apps to do . i read about some others having issues with it , but is has been very solid for me
just starting ... .and so far i am enjoying this game immensely ... once i have played it for awhile longer , i will most definitely come back and do another review ...
i like this game a lot and my kids ( age 5 and 7 ) love it too . good game for long trips !
do n't like the idea of only having one picture to look at instead of all four pictures . yes , some r easy to guess with only one pic but prefer all four pics .
this takes me back - of course it is n't for today 's gamer but just interesting to see how far we have come
you should make it a free app again because its way to high for an app and what if something happens to ur kindle you will have to pay the price again . i have not bought it
it is a really bad copy of fruit ninjas . the one shot mode does n't work , it wo n't let you cut the same fruit in a row twice . do n't get this game .
i did n't think i would like it but it is totally addictive . i ca n't stop playing . love the game . highly recommended
i am using . first gen kindle fire and i am having no problems . i wish there were more levels in the free games .
these were really hard and to get help the cost of the coins were ok but you can not earn enough coins to pay for a hint unless you buy more coins .
downloaded for my granddaughter , but she 's not to interested in playing this one
it is too early to rate , but the 1st 15 levels are easy and i am having fun . i will continue to play and will write another review then .
my son and i enjoy playing the chess game on the kindle . the app has never locked up . i think it is fine for my use .
there are to many glitches and it gets really boring after awhile y is this such a popular game ? a a
can you guys make this a free app of the day please please please please please please . i know the game is great but it will be great help if it was the free app of the day
if you like hidden object games this game has a lot of them . the hidden object scenes are fun but the game is too short and the story line is too simple .
many whole family including my three year old love playing this game . it 's great watching my little one laughing at all the minions ! !
this is a good game for everyone . i would like it on game night with the family or just one on the kindle
if you play often questions repeat , but it is a good way to test your memory ! ? seem random , do n't seem to get harder as you advance
it is fun to play . i love trying to not use the help button . i 've played alot of these games and its cool cause you do n't have to buy the whole thing . love it
it sets a high bar for creativity and polish . clever and very well executed . we 're looking forward to the next update .
this game is addicting and i love it because you only have the tap the card that you want to move and the game sends it to the appropriate stack of cards .
was okay at the beginning but not what my daughter thought it was going to be . guess you have to like air hockey
this is just the kind of game i like . a puzzle game that keeps you guessing , but is not too impossible to figure out . i am enjoying it !
i like this game app , but would like it to be a little harder to do . maybe i just did n't continue on to higher level .
when will anyone need to do fractions , but if you do this is the way to go , but a paper and pencil works also .
fun game ! kind of difficult at times , so it 's got a bit of a challenge to it , but an exciting game . good for killing time !
i loved this game ! some parts are hard but most of the time it 's easy . great free game i recommend it for a party .
so far this game is pretty good . gets boring when you have all hidden objects to get a needed item . most mini games are good .
i love this app . i play it every morning on the bus on my way to school ! but i wish hints did n't cost so much
first time downloading any app . took awhile to figure out how to change c to f but worked out ok. easy to follow
fun game with no glitches . it can become addictive , but totally worth the addiction . can be played on the run , as the game saves each time you log out .
very fun game . when you first start it takes a minute to figure out what you 're supposed to do , but after you know what to do its a lot of fun ...
go with another app that wo n't crash as much and get in your way with ads all over the place .
very fun game . very challenging to . you really have to use your brain . just the game i was looking for .
i keep this on my tablet so when i have down time between meetings , i can : & # 34 ; recharge & # 34 ; my mind with this .
cooking dash is a really cool game because it takes time to learn it . it also is a very good skill game .
every time i sit down , i pick up my kindle and play this game . it keeps my brain working and active .
the app does what it says ... i ca n't complain . it 's easy to use . just click on the app you want deleted and hit delete ... done .
best game ever i played it for a week straight i started playing it and then i got all of my family and friends addicted to it to .
i tried six or eight different solitaire games before i found one that has everything i wanted . i love everything about this one ! ! !
it 's a good game very much enjoy the game . it also will work your brain . a must play game very very good game .
concept is cool . app of the day so i got it without really needing it . lives on the sd card so i 'm ok with that .
this numbers game would of been easier to play if the instructions told me how to play the game . it made no sense so i deleted it .
love it . it is really hard though since you pick from bad robots . i could barely even get past the first few rounds .
this is a pretty fun game . my kids and i like to play together . it is addictive and appropriate for everyone
i love this game , even without playing it i would love it because i have n't seen graphics this good on any game i have played . just looking at picture is excellent ! !
when i first started playing candy crush saga it took me by surprise . but as i played more and more i learned to love it so much . keep games like this coming

this is one of my favorite games to play . i 'm getting better all the time ! great time filler with fun , .
it took me a while to figure everything out but i did and this game is great . i recommend this game for hours of fun .
nothing special here . it does what it says , though . i do n't spend much time on facebook . i really bought it so i could test it for my wife . she likes facebook .

outside of the ads before just about every deal , it 's solitaire , plain and simple . great time to waste time . i recommend it
i love this game , i just wished you did n't need actual money to get more coins . most other slot games has more virtual money , but not as additive .
its a cute game fun to play interesting on how many ways to build machines to get job done . unfortunately i am stuck needing one more star , which means i can not go any further .
boring and repetitive the bonus is simple . on the positive it does play with you and allow you to gain points .
the only reason i got this is because everybody at my school calls me fat ! : ( i believe them . ever since someone said that i have been watching my weight : (
free does not mean free . this game constantly asks for $ $ $ there should be a way to block that function .
the game was fun but it could have been a little more challenging . i think young children would enjoy the game .
this is a great hangman game . very entertaining & amp ; quite enjoyable . i like the use of categories & amp ; it has aa hint feature if needed . great work , guys .
too many times i have to post to facebook or buy more points to complete a mission . interesting concept though .
ca n't find it anywhere so that i can play it . i 'm very disappointed in this . i would like to play it
waste of time , never got bonus , poor quality i do not have time to waste waiting for a bonus - too frustrating .
jump jump jump fun play it a lot u should definitely get it is a very fun game you will never get bored can get a little frustrating but you never get bored
worth every penny , totally . need a few more levels and fun to play but they should make the sides of view , free .
this is a really fun addicting game ! this is definitely one of my fav mahjong games ever ! i play it all the time !
i love this little widget for my kindle it helps me monitor my usage . i would recommend this to anyone , and as a bonus it 's free !
its working smoother than the old app . i can see and delete faster . makes checking email a more pleasant experience
this app has any game you might want , but i found myself going to the same 3 or 4 games . to much choice can be a bad thing . graphics and motion are great .
i like this puzzle although i think it is for young children , but it can also be difficult . i will ask my grandchildren to play it and watch their response .
nice alarm with a lot of good features ! perfect for work or school . would recommend to anyone looking for a simple but nice alarm clock !
these are great for learning to read . i love the cat in the hat and this app is so good for learning to read and enjoying books

this is a great game . good way to pass time when waiting . my 10 year old will love this . so far its not too hard .
it is a pretty decent game . helps me pass time at lunch . pay outs are ok. i am only on level 5 right now . let 's see what else i can play on here .
this game has a lot of choices on what to do , what to learn , and you can even make your own cards .
it 's got good graphics . i 've played games just like it before but never stuck with them like this one , i enjoy playing this game .
i love all of the libii apps . i have nearly all of the apps from this maker and they have always made me happy and made me laugh .

this is a great app ! i love having so many sound choices . i also like the fact that it will play continuously !
this game is a lot of fun ! ! it 's also a little challenging for you it 's a great way to keep your brain working at a set pace .
i got the game to see what it was like . i never thought i would play it more then any of my other games . this is a great game . i am totally addicted to it .
good graphics . the multiplayer is great . the maps are big and there are a number of them . gameloft are really good at these games . top notch .
this game is very good ! i really enjoy it ! the graphics are super cool . the game play is just too much fun .
just like the full site on my pc . i like the interface and this one will stay on my kindle .
it is not the type of game that i like to play . more for a child or younger person . but maybe someone else like it better

i was hoping for a relatively normal game of bingo but this is n't it . want a game like you would go out to play .
my 2 yr old son will play this game for hours if we let him . this game is definitely worth the buck you pay for it .
used this app for fun , but i never was able to beat it , so i lost interest in the game .
was mad at first that i ran out of moves and had to pay 3.99 for the game but the more i play the happier i am that i did i love love love this game & lt ; 3
i 'm a senior but this is easy game with just enough challenge for me to play . some of these games are more difficult for older hands .

i love this game i. am so happy its on kindle now great fun for all ages . a must for grand parents .
i love this game but it cost to much money to play and you got to the end of the game and had to pay more money to finish the game
it 's a good game . it 's quick and easy to use . you go through your lives very quickly though and have to wait for it to recharge .
oh my gosh this is just what i needed and it was free and that 's even better because this is perfect and i highly reccomend this if you are looking for a calculator
a lot harder than i thought but fun . makes me realize that i remember some things but not all things .
very nice to be able to sit and hear the current magazines that will be offered for the upcoming months . wish you would have the awake magazines in this way as well .
this one was downloaded by accident . i forgot to turn off the internet access button and my 2 year old added it . does not work for me .
i enjoyed this game . i 'm a really big fan of puzzles and this will certainly keep me busy for quite some time . i certainly recommend .
i downloaded it cause it was the free app of the day so what the heck . i would recomend this to a child between the ages of 1 and 3 .
i really like this game but i think it would be better if you could skip over the ones you do n't know and come back to them .
amazing . ive been waiting forever and now its finally here . absolutely perfect except sometimes minor glitches that cause death but still perfect
i like the game it 's challenging and fun . i like the backgrounds you can choose and it 's a quick game if you want it to be .
this ap is addictive and should be used with care . lots of fun for young and old . try it soon !
do n't listen to any of the negative reviews . this app is so fun . i have a blast playing it and i 'm sure you will too . it is worth the money .

i love that i can now play candy crush on my kindle fire ! i can play faster than on my pc ! ! !
works great on kindle fire . amazing app . can set alarm , sleep timer , great selection of music ! really great and does n't need any fixes .
have to pay to get hints , it 's ok confusing but ok. it makes you think and get confused . so i rated it .
this is a really fun shooter game , but it is glitchy , it shuts off on you randomly . if you fix this i will give it five stars ! !
its a pretty good game but you need you have to have lots of glu credits if u wan na buy any of the good stuff
i like dressing these girls up in pretty clothes because it makes me think about designing clothes . i like it very much
this app is okay . would prefer better art work and maybe better quotes . however it is very simply and easy to use which is nice .
i love it and would recommend it to any looking for a real jigsaw puzzle , it actually have the pieces to put together
this app is super adorable but the castle is a little bit pricey . i might buy it though simple because i like having all the food and clothes is want .
i enjoy this app . it helps my brain and challenges me . i use this app a few times a day . i also use a sudoku game book
my 12 year old & 9 year old finished the game the same day they got it . my 9 year old still likes playing on the different levels .
this game is awesome i never get tired of playing this game you will never get tired of playing this game
some of the puzzles are easy and then some are hard . but that 's what makes it challenging . love it a lot .
very fun wish it was more challenging but it was exciting loved the story line i wish the game had been a bit longer
i think this app is great if you have a love of movies and want to test your memory skills .
i too love this on my iphone . however . it looks a lot nicer on the kindle . a great fun casual game for everyone .
it works ok but i thought i would alert me with some sort of sound when i received a message . other than that it works great .
fairly easy to do . may take a little time to master it , but it 's a lot of fun and a great time waster .
lots of fun . no problems or glitches yet . would definitely recommend it to others got free so thats even better .
i love it and i cant wait until its like pc . i have broke my pc and i 'm stuck playing this : ( but its still awesome .
easy to do with a little thought . relaxes me just before i go to bed . sort of like a bed time story except in picture form .
i love this game . i can always beat the opponents . i play this every night before i go to bed . it is just like the real game .
i really like this app on my kindle fire . it gives me a trash fix when i need one . i like it better than the regular site .
great way to waste time and very addicting ... it 's colorful , fun , and fast ... best solitaire game i 've played so far ...
i got it free a couple months ago and i have to say this app is what 's helping me threw school enough said .
game pretty cool so far except i could use a hint right now and i have to either rate game or buy one . but besides that i like it
this game really fun keeps you busy to and can you do something like an update that lets us play offline ?
it 's more so like what ca n't this app do now ! ! easy to use , accessible and i personally enjoy the updated app .
the wheel to choose from is confusing . how to advance even after each station has 3 stars . need to understand the rules better .
this was a fun coin game . i liked it more than coin dozer . had more bonuses etc . try it you 'll like it .
it seems like it would be way too simple to be fun , but you find yourself getting addicted to it very quickly . the difficulty does increase as you play , and it is a really fun game .
i downloaded this game cuz i could n't play it on facebook for some reason . but i do enjoy this game .
i enjoyed the game it was challenging at times but a great find especially if you like to challenge your mind
i ca n't get past the first set of levels . i 'm wondering if its just me or if its the game , otherwise its good .
this app is so good . it is the easiest app i ever downloaded it is so awesome ... ..i word recommend it to anyone who i just starting to draw it helped me
great game . unfortunately , to play on it you have to spend money . i do n't like to have to spend my money to play a game .
this app is the best game ever ! i am so happy its finally on android ! ! u must get it ! ! ! it is fun and addicting .
i love this game . on the computer there is a game like this . please make more of this drawing games for free .
i deleted this app within minutes . i found it hard to play , have to spend $ $ , does n't make any sense . do n't want any more like this .
google has been my favorite search engine forever . very glad i can get it on my new kindle fire hd .
i love tetris but this one is a timed game and i do n't like them because i am not good at times games ... but some people might really love it
not much here , need more pages or subjects , got boring after a while , would not recommend , boring boring boring boring
easy to use and it has many options for bible selection , also great voice for listening to scriptures read with feeling ... .
nice app for kindle fire enough of a challenge without being to hard very large file for things with small memory though
the game is okay for a hidden object but it was so short you can play it all in one sitting .
this game is very good . it gives you many options for clothing , hair , makeup etc . i very much enjoy it .
this game is very fun . there are so many different fruits and there r 3 levels u can play so it never gets boring .
this game is really addictive . i am having a hard time putting it down . i have been playing it all day .
it 's old school and the boys beat it the first day i down loaded it , graphics are ok but now it 's over .
i 've been waiting to get this as the faotd and yesterday was that day . graphics and music are great ! one of the better apps . love it !
it never used to force close on me when the match was done loading . even in single player it will load and then force close on me , plz fix this
i hate this app . it crashes on me so many times . user interface is no where near ios . layout terrible . not suitable for high resolution screen like the kindle fire hd 8.9
its kinds creepy . i got it for my 5 year old and it is definetly not what i thought it was !
the game is pretty awesome . i definitely would give it a chance . odds are , you will be addicted after the first couple of levels .
i really like playing match 3 games they are a great way to pass the time when bored . fun and exciting to play .
i deleted it the second i got installed it . the controls are off and very much confusing to be at least . i would not recommend it at all ! !
it is one of the best games i have ever played , but their is an update and i ca n't play it
if you love the sims this is all you need . free and all sim like . just need internet to play though
if you have patience going back and forth between locations and searching out hidden objects , this is a good game to play .
this would be at the top of my list of favorite games if it were n't for the need to pay for additional stages . otherwise , it 's a great ap .
okay , everyone was right . this game is fun . i 've been a hold out but recently tried it . now i ca n't wait to have time to play it .
this game is my favorite game ever . works great on the kindle fire ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! if you love challenging games , get temple run .
nice game for a while but gets boring after playing a few times , too many of these running games . please use more imagination .
it took me a while to get the hang of the controls but once i did it was a lot of fun .
ca n't stop playing this game . ca n't sleep as i play till i win . very easy to play and i like the stats feature .
i really enjoyed looking at this game for the first 10 minutes or so , but after that time i got pretty bored with it .
if you want a break from candy crush try this . graphics are n't as good as cc but it 's still fun .
i ca n't even put into words how much i love this game . i 'm addicted to it . ca n't even express how much i love this game .
mine wo n't download . whenever it gets close it goes back to the beginning . and this may be just my internet but i do n't understand why it would be
i was happy to see this for the kindle . i played it on desk top computer for years . worth the money
i bought this app and did n't really like it its not worth the money ( to me ) . all you do is draw and its not worth it .
i 'm hoping it will help my two year old learn to read . either way its entertaining for her . love this book .
i think it 's fun . it does n't always play right . i like the bonus money . over all its a great game and i like graphics .
i like this game . you can play at anytime , interesting how it works . playing against other people that do n't know who you are is great , so if you make a mistake it 's ok .
the device has a camera and i did n't notice that there was already an app available . i 'll find a use for it .
fun game , gives you something to do when you are bored . fun to play against your friends on facebook , not a bad game for free
another great game that could use a lot of ui improvements . it 's fun to play but it really needs so design improvements
i love this game i love animals too thank . you please keep up the good work looking forward to more games
loving it so far i hate that you ca n't skip the hard ones but overall i love the game so far
this version of hangman did not meet my 8 year olds expectations . she was extremely disappointed . she likes to play with someone and this version was for solo play only .
a really fun game.i would definitely recommend this game.i even got my husband to play and he also liked . it .
love playing this game . rated it a five , the only thing i do n't like is the ads . very addictive . recommend it for everyone .
this game is so awesome ! i love all of it . i go on constantly to take care of my pou . my favorite part is all the clothes you can get .
if you like these type of games , bejeweled , jewel quest , then this will keep you interested . it is free ( at least it was for me ) and you cant beat free .
i like games that are a challenge . some are easy but some make you think . great game to play to pass the time .
you can also make it a little bit harder to find the object in the game and have it a lot more challenging and fun to play .
its pac man how could you not love it ! this is an old fun game to play and i never get tired of it
i love mahjong games , and this one is even better . it combines mahjong with comics and a kind of treasure hunt . i love it .
i have really enjoyed playing this game . my grandkids help keep my coins up and then i get to spend them
its like every other game . but its even worse because they want you to be on it every 3 minutes to collect money . that 's time i do n't have to be addicted to a game .
love this app . it works well . when i ca n't text from my phone i use this app and it goes right through .
if you know scrabble , you can play wwf . the challenge is building your opponent base . enjoy creating words and seeing what you can do with random letters .
really the only reason i picked one star is because i ca n't pick zero stars it wo n't install so that 's pretty stupid
it 's great except for the fact that it only has 8 levels and that u have to buy the rest
it is a pretty basic puzzle game . my niece played it at the family christmas , she is 7 and played till the battery was dead !
not a bad game , gives me an opportunity to practice before i play the game with friends . wish you could play with two instead of four .
i just got this and it wo n't let me install the app it deserves less than 1 star so do n't waste your money
i play a lot of bingo games and this one is especially addictive . keep up the good work with new and exciting upgrades .
i was disappointed with the fact that the new player did n't even get any chance to play a short time without paying .
it started our okay and then started asking the same questions . i never could go to different questions . if could went to more and different questions i would had enjoyed it .
love music , always enjoyed music trivia . now get to play a game with content i like and more trivia to learn .
once we start playing it is hard to stop . i love being able to flip over one picture at a time , it allows you to set your own difficulty .
just like any other game you would find on facebook . it is really boring . i wan na game were i do n't have to have friends that play it to move up a level !
its a great app and all , u know , the great grafics ... but it repeats the dinosaur , then i thought j could put the bones together . but u cant

i was looking for a game that makes your mind work . this game makes a person want to beat your own goals . this game will always be on my kindle .
dont play this one as much i like the other poker game i have better but it is a challange
tests your brain without being to hard . use it at least once a week . would be better with achievements and a timer
this is a great game to play when you do n't want to have to think ! loads of entertainment & amp ; it 's free ! ! ! ,
this is a good game better than others i have tried all should try just to say u did will become addictive game !
i love this game so much . its a lot of fun and you have to think about where you should put places and how many vehicles you need . it is addictive .
this game is so fun i almost always play it . i love it so much it rocks . i just love it
i do n't like it . thought it would be more of a cross word puzzle . it 's not . if you like guessing games , it 'll be fun . just not the game for me .
this is a good game because it challenges you to find a way to win . not boring at all and one of my favorites .
this is a game that my grandson totally loves to play . it never gets & # 34 ; old & # 34 ; to him . he is three years old .
this game is very fun . a puzzle that really gets your brain working . is challenging at some spots , but then when you finally get it , it 's just awesome .
my dragon is a fun game . and i 've recommend this games to my family and they loved it a lot ! !
actually a really neat and fun game . great for kids and adults . keeps kids entertained and easy to learn and operate .
it 's just as easy to open each email account as to open this app and in turn open each account . i really do n't need this app and have already uninstalled it .
you will get so mad how long it took to get this game . so glad because after like six months after made finally on amazon . log playing but levels can get frustrating .
fun game . easy and very addictive . i just want that great white already . not far to go . definitely recommend this game
doodle devil certainly lives up to its name ! and its not one of those ten minutes and ur done kind of games either . this is a truly fun , challenging app
its quick , informative and works just fine no issues that are negative regarding this app we like it very much
it is an ok app . not what i expected for this type of app . i will have to look around more .
i enjoy playing the game . its a lot of fun . great to pass time . i recommend it and i 'm sure if you like those old nintendo games , you 'll enjoy this one too .
this is an okay game . the riddles are medium . would be nice if you could link to facebook and ask for help .
all in the family have enjoyed . nice addition with the mission based challenges . only complaint is that we need more levels ! !
i love playing this game its fantastic , i would recommend it to everybody ! im a grandma and never thought i would like a game like this
they have alot of questions and answers and everytime they play the game , it just increases their knowledge . thank you .
this calculator is free , large , and does just what it is supposed to do . what more can i ask for ?
liked this game . i spent a lot of time trying to figure out the puzzles . only thing i did not like is the game is free but you have yo pay to get clues .
my niece and i really enjoyed this app ! and such a cute idea using candy too ! a lot of fun !
would n't work at all , would n't load after i downloaded it , deleted it , worthless
this is a fun an interesting game which , can be difficult . but when difficult its just more fun ! this game can keep any person busy for hours on end , there is no doubt about it .
i like a challenge . and this is a challenge . if you get bored this is what you should get . i just got it if you write a review you get free hints .
this is a good app for kindle fire hd . i did have a problem trying to figure out how to turn it off and still use other apps .
it is a great game that takes your mind off things ... .i think this game is so cool ... i have never played a game that is e ever this fun before
let me download it on my kindle fire and maybe i might give it at least a few more stars ! ! thanks .
this is great app to record and keep track of the books you 've read and to read reviews from others .
i like floppy bird it 's awesome game it 's hard so be careful when playing . overall a really fun game it 's flappy
this is a fun and memory challenging trivia game for those of us who grew up in the age of `` good tv shows '' . i 've played it quite often so far .
just started playing this game and i 'm already hooked . it 's right up my alley because i love word puzzles and games that challenge my brain .
it does n't work at all you get to a part of the game and it does n't work you ca n't play this game and do n't get it trust me on this one .
this was a fun game . my 9 year old daughter and i finished it in less than an hour , but she thoroughly enjoyed figuring out the mini puzzles . thinking of getting more for her .
i was n't going to try this game at first but i 'm glad i did ! i personally like it better than candy crush ... and i like candy crush a lot !
this app is so awesome . i can access my computer anywhere in the house without having to get up . it is also super easy to install . this is my favorite app ! ! !
this is a good time consuming game that works your brain . just need to play it for a bit to save coins and purchase the no ad option .
very customizable and functional . just what i was looking for to replace the default widget that came with the phone .
this game is missing any & quot ; fun factor & quot ; that makes you want to play more than 5 levels . no crashes for me , but could n't turn off sound effects .
this game is ok i mean its ok but after a while it gets boring so i recommend it to people who have patience
fun and addicting app . sometimes a person has to be careful in how the web is cut . fun for all ages as my grandchildren like as well as myself .
i browse through this app regularly to find great deals for holiday gifts . i find that it is easy to navigate , and generally well designed . 2 thumbs up : )
i hated it it was hard to place stuff and every thing you can build with was realy bad so i dont recommend getting it
this game is super fun and great . it can get a little boring waiting for things to finish , but its still really fun and i recommend this game for everyone .
this is a decent program . i used it a bit but i had got it for my teen son to help him .
great app . my son loves touching the items on the pages to hear and see the names . this story teaches a great lesson .
i love this game ever since i was little . this game is easy but there will be a few challenges , but you will get the hang of it .
i have become an addict for dress up games . this game is great for anyone that loves fashion and makeup !
it seemed to me that it did not work well so i deleted it i like to do puzzles occasionally but not this one
i loved this app during the halloween season but i wish new scary stories were added every day to make this app interesting .
it 's a really good game surprisingly i started it up and played a game and was instantly hooked it is a nice casual game that you can play for 10 minutes or a couple of hours .
quick game for those times when you only have only a few minutes or when your not sure how much time you have to play .
the program is good it is just i really do not have need of it that much . the information is accurate and timely .
found this to be too difficult . maybe a stylus would have helped but we never made it past level 1
i like his app because it can be used on the run . i can find places and get directions easily .
it 's just what you 're looking should you want to play a game that 's not stressful but highly challenging ! the music 's pretty nice also .
looking forward to playing this game . i have in the past and it is one of my favorites . thank you .
it was fun playing this game and trying to find all the hidden objects . some objects were easier to find than others . it kept your mind going .
great brain game ! i did have to cheat a little ... ..i get frustrated easy , but only on level 9 and 10. ca n't wait for more levels ! ! !
i can not even get thru 1 level without a force close . sucks . seems like a nice set up though
it does not work anymore it never loads on my kindle fire hd this makes me so mad , i mean it used to but not anymore
i got this for my toddler and she thinks its great . for me not so much , but perfect for her .
when is the new version coming out cuz there is this one world that says coming soon idk when that is do u guys know ?
really hard but u want to stay on for hours i love it my mom loves it and sometimes i do i love it and my family does to
keeps me entertained . grand kids like it . it 's an awesome game . you get to spend quality time with someone .
fun game once you get the hang of it . the only draw back is you have to purchase some things to advance in the game . other than that , it 's a fun game to play .
only have this game 4 stars because of the ads . other than that , this game is a lot of fun and will really pass time quickly .
best driving game in the world ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i had been looking for a cool and challenging driving game and i finally found one .
the game is fun and it is entertaining but it takes to long to get back around to your turn . i lost interest
this game would be in my top ten for all kindle games ! i recommend this game for a lot of people so download and enjoy ! ! : )
pretty good little game . it 's fun just to see how good u can do . do n't let the coins fall off the sides though .
this is a nice and easy app with a useful user interface ; a nice addition to my kindle fire and best of all , it 's free .
this seems to be a pretty good game . so far it is fun and relaxing . graphics are real good and i think it is a game everyone should at least give a chance . happy gaming all .
does n't make you wait for long periods for things to grow , build , etc ! very good plus to not have to keep waiting !
rating because love the movie more than the game because do n't like in-app purchasing the game was hard but interesting for anyone who likes those games
the game is very fun and addictive . hard to quit after you start . works very well on my kindle fire .
i think it is very entertaining . my nephew likes it alot . i am 11 years old . i like it because , u just draw a line , and u have a pretty picture .
its alot of fun and i can play it on my phone , and kindle fire . it is really alot of fun and you can challenge yourself and others .
only played it once and it was good but kind of boring ... . but what do you expect with hangman ... . very true ! ! ! !
i got it for free and i loved it until it crashed so i uninstalled and then tried to re install it but it said that i still had it and i 'm still trying to re install
talk about an addicting game ! i ca n't wait for future levels to be added ! i would recommend this game to every one !
i 'm very surprised how my daughter plays soooo well with this app ! i think it makes little ones realize how important is to take care of a baby .
who does n't like robots that beat each other up . l like the app but i wish it would include the main characters
when you run out of spins , you are asked to buy . it 's free to download , but not free to play .
i really do love netflix and being able to get the information on my fire is wonderful . then , getting to watch a movie there is fun .
this is a better game for the grandkids ... they love it and wanted me to learn too ... i got through all the levels too quickly .
this was a fun game . full of adventure and strategy . the story line was interesting and there was so much to do that kept me hooked .
love it when i have been in the past two years ago by the younger brother is the younger than one year
no matter which tab i click on all i get is the us news . dont know hot to delete it so i can try to download it again .
it 's a fun game . i like it because it 's fun and entertaining . i would recommend it to adults and children .
it is a very pretty game but gets boring fairly fast . it does n't make me want to purchase the game . i have enjoyed it but probably will delete .
i really like the app its quite fun the thing i do n't like about it is that it keeps on freezing after every single game other than that the app is good ! !
i must be old , no instructions to figure out how to play , i tried several times , so i deleted it from my kindle
my kid loves this game . she plays it all the time and has my wife hooked on it too . it tells you when to collect your coins and gives you cute animals
love the game in solo mode . online play is a little tedious and slow , but glad it 's an option . have n't tried pass and play yet , but i 'm sure it 's fine .
not a huge cat fan . this game is ok but even though it gets harder finding cats just got boring for me
this is a awesome game that is a really fun game that is kid safe and fun for all ages
i like this game but there seem to be a lot of adds . when a game is free i expect some adds but these seem to last longer then others .
it is like no other game i have ever played in my life it is just like the the game
i like this game a lot i just wish i can change the characters . do not want to play with the character all the time .
this game loads too slowly for me . it is just ok for when i 'm trying to find something to do .
this game is not much fun if you are playing by yourself . you really have more fun if you can play with 2 or 3 others i have found .
my girls love playing this game ! they love to decorate the bunny , and the egg ! ! ! this is a cute game for young kids , easy to use and they enjoy it !
runs great on kindle fire . i 've played several games of this type & amp ; this one is by far the best . i do n't get bored like others . two thumbs up .
i love this game u need to get it it 's fun and a good learning game get it now please
i think this app is more for smart phones . at first i liked the variety of bird calls but it was constantly closing . oh well , it was fun while it lasted ...
it 's nice to have this on my kindle . it does everything i would expect it to compared to the regular version .
i download this app and my little girl loved it ... its a fast learning process and i would recommend this to my friends ...
enjoy playing this game and look forward to getting better at it . takes some concentration and i definitely find it challenging .
i thoroughly enjoyed playing this game . the story line is good , graphics are great and overall the game is very addictive . highly recommended
my grandson ordered this for himself and he loves it . is n't it amazing how a six year old knows how to download games and apps but my husband can not work his tv remote ? !
i deleted it the next day . worthless . not user friendly , would not let me exit after making notes . nor would it let me make changes .
its an ok game , if you have time to play it . but can also only go so far before it costs money as with any game
i bought this twice i love it so much . very challenging . the game sucks you right in . you should . try it out
good game like that you have to reach different goals waiting for more great games in future keep up the good work
great app ! i have used many others and i like this one best ! i find that most places that i am looking for can be found , and that was n't the case in other apps !
my husband and i got this game . it is really cute . i like that you can hatch and grow dragons .
looking forward to getting more hands on with it , it seems to have everything you could want , cant be bad .
simple to play and fast paced . love , puzzle games so this was a must for me ! its also great that it syncs with facebook if you play the game there .
this app has a great variety of sounds so i can mix & amp ; match depending on the mood i 'm in ... or want to be in !
i love this app ! it 's easy to use and very detailed . works everytime too , does n't freeze up like some apps do .
unlike the pc edition of this , this android one is not quite as easy to navigate . you do seem to have more in the way of free books to go with this edition .
you will want to spend money but as long as you keep at it you really dont have to . fun and addictive .
can not play more than one card at a time because playing another card is to small to read . eye problems .
it 's ok. alot like the other versions but you have to have a creative mind to build the vehicles to get to the end .
i ca n't stop playing this game . i go back and redo some level to get a perfect score if i did not get it on the first time .
there are much better physics type games out there , for example any one of the angry birds series . played it a couple of times and got bored fast .
tetris blitz is a fun game , but harder to play . it 's fast and i just have n't caught on how all the plays work .
this app is great . has all the answers for this particular logo game . graphics are full color and easy to read . makes a good review for other logo games , also . it is a keeper !
i really like it its a lot like the show . i recommend it if you 're a fan of the show .
this game was ok. it said you could have multiple players , but i never saw that option and believe me , i searched all icons . just glad i did n't have to pay for it .
i like this app . it definitely comes in handy . i do n't have to carry my bible so i am not having the extra item to carry . i can use it during break time with ease .
i like this games because u can learn how to design your own shoes and make the special for someone .
i play this on facebook and i am so glad it is available on my kindle . now i can play it on the go .
when you ask for round trip rates - it gives you one way , you think that it is a good deal but then when you try to book it . the price is crazy high
it is a fun and very cool game to play with and it challenges your mind with the fun puzzles .
i was hoping to see more variety of shows and movies in this program . the app is cool but they need to improve their collection .
this app is bad if ur a kid . if a adult that wants to run a bar get this app now .
hard to put down . good educational tool . even younger people would enjoy this game . you really must try it today !
this app crashed as soon as i clicked it to open it . i deleted it right away so it would not effect anything else
all i know is the add would n't get out of my way when i wanted to play the game the sims
i removed from my phone , too much like other games i have and i dont have time for them all
i do n't even remember what this was that 's how much i thought of it . blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah
there is not really much more that you can say about the app , it runs fine it installed just great . nothing more to say
you have to try this game it is so cool so you download this app it is a fun a great game
a single picture comes up and you guess what tv show it is from . i have only played a few so far but it is enjoyable .
you know those games that are so boring but so addictive ? ya well this game is one of those so ya get it but be aware its boring but additive
this game is extremely addicting . only play it if you have a lot of time and patience . not meant to fill a short wait .
it makes you care for these little smurfs and build them a town with a garden . you can play without spending real money . game is fun for kids .
this is the best game ! it is better than temple run ! i really recommend this app to temple run lovers cause its the same concept but much more fun .
this game is challenging and yet fun i find it to be quite addictive : ) sometimes i really have to think about what the word is
i played the game so i could watch the music video . the video is sick in a cute way . way to go !
i 've had this app forward while now . i was n't impressed , and so i let my friends and others play it . i still would n't have paid for it .
there are some really fun pictures that bring back the 90s , but there are more that without google i would have never gotten . even after finding them on google i still do n't remember them .
so realistic . it even shows mistakes and lets you clean them up . now they want to copy the designs on their own nails
i love this game and find it hard to put down ! just wish we could earn more time on or have the ability to set the time limit you have to play a puzzle .
a great game to test your movie knowledge , however , maybe not so wonderful for those of you who are n't movie fans .
awesome . other people are having it reset the game but it is perfect on my kindle fire hd 7. no glitches . no crashing . just fun and awesome and silly and awesome and epic . yay .
this game is amazing ! why is it so addicting ? i have no idea , and it 's not as easy as it looks either . great colors and graphics .
i am playing candy crush on my iphone and on my computer but this version on the kindle does n't sync with them like words does and i do n't want to start an entire new game .
i got this app thinking it would be levels and its not . its just a bunch of mini game that repeat and repeat and i got sick of it .
it works when it wants to , i hate how it will constantly close and i 've upgraded it twice still same thing so i just gave up on it at the end .
similar game play to angry birds but way less repetitive . you do n't just launch and hope , you usually get several throws power cat and helpful power ups and the graphics and sound are good .
i tried to play this game and it took too long to download and come up . it just was n't worth the wait !
fun some pics are easy others pretty hard . all in all a pretty fun game . i recommend it to pass the time .
have had a great time playing this game . i enjoy the images and have been a winner since the start .
very interesting relaxing game . do n't like to buy items so it 's all my own skill . will probably delete in a few days .
just the most go to place for anything your hunting for or wanting to know about , starts up quick on my kindle
love to see the prizes coming . ca n't wait to get a puzzle completed . this game is a no brainer . try it and you too will be addicted .
this is a fun app , and it passes the time quickly . the 4 pics 1 word app is really fun and easy to use .
so awesome ! get this app you ` 'll love it if you are looking for a great game get this ! get it
this game is beautiful , i love all mahjong games including this one , what else can i say except that i have about twenty different mahjong games love them all .
when i saw this game i thought it would be lame so i tried it and now that i tried it i have almost all of the other story games point is you should try it !
entertaining , challenging , and scary ! hard to put down once you start ! cant wait to try more big fish games ! 20 !
my son loves this game . it 's cute how you can save their dishes . this game will definitely keep the kids busy .
this app is poop and is not attractive poop is still no attractive so do n't waste your time poop poop poop poop
it is a very very very very very fun and cool game to play and to share with friends to play
it is a very entertaining game where you meet a lot of new and interesting people who help you in the game .
it 's angry birds but you get to use your kindle as a steering wheel . it 's more fun to an old character like me than the other angry bird games currently being played .
extremely addictive ! does n't do two letter words but a great game on my kindle fire . i have stayed up way past my bedtime because of this game
i can sit and play this game for hours on end . i have it ; loaded on all my devices . thank you
this is a great game to just kick back and relax . what 's really awesome is that it was free ! thank you !
thought it would have more video . its like reading headlines of a newspaper . do n't really get too much from it .
this game is awesome it should be bought by all people it has no problems on my kindle fire and my little brother loves this game
i 'm not sure i understand the game yet ( and my husband says it is & quot ; cheating & quot ; to play tetris like this ) , but it is fun and addictive .
my first scan took some time but after that i never knew anything was going on until i checked it . does n't drag my kindle down and much to learn once i really get into it
this bingo game is the best i 've played so far . you get coins every hour and i 've had no issues with it freezing up my kindle like i have had with other bingo games .
you have to pay to get any sounds and the only reason i 'm posting this review is to get more sounds
i love this game so much it is so addicting i can not stop playing it i can play this game 24 7
i 've been waiting for this app for some time , and now that 's it 's here and free . it was so worth the wait . a game for all ages .
this is an amazing game because i am always doing word search puzzles and i really enjoy beating my own times ! ! !
like game . glad to see more games on kindle fire hd . like all their other games . keep up the great work
love this game so fun to play i play with my hubby all the time he and i compete when we play its so funny
i played this game and the first time it was challenging . then the second time it was less so . now i do n't play it at all .
game works well and is fun to play , grandkids like it , story format is good , and graphics are good too
it works great , it keeps my device safe and it 's so easy to run . i down loaded for my phone and kindle as well !
i love this game so much ! i love the fact that its like real life graphics are pretty good too
love these brain teaser games and especially when they are free . i really wish there were more levels so you can play longer .
i do n't like it i am trying to download it and it does not work i was getting so excited to watch my favorite disney channel shows but now i can not ! ! ! ! ) :
love this app its amazing and i cant put it down ! all my free time i play this awesome game ! must download
very easy to use and really helps you learn the game . i recommend it . really a great program to help with chess .
i have no idea how to play this game or what the idea of it is . will not be playing .
i love this app but i wish the stuff cost less , but i love it . oh yeah i love the realistic features this app has .
easy to play on my kindle fire . if you like the board game you 'll enjoy this app . i could n't find any instructions but it was easy to figure out .
this game is so cool for girls that are into fashion like me ! i did so many levels the rest is coming soon ! # love this game
the game is flat out boring . but i can appreciate the work that went into it.i 'm sure some one will like it though
this is a fun game , relaxing finding the missing items . it would be nice to have a walkthrough for a few of the islands , but you can figure out most of them easily .
love these games ! keeps me guessing for days sometimes . i flip between a few different apps for this type of game .
very challenging i do n't watch much television so far this has been very challenging . i have been getting help from family and friends .
this game is so cool i mean come on who wont like this game i love love this game it is fun fun fun !
love the pics and the ability to choose difficulty levels . beautiful horses . would definitely recommend this game to my friends .
found game rather repetitious . same old thing over and over and over . office jerk is way more fun than this game .
fun quick play that reminds me of all the cartoons i used to love growing up . like the movie and tv show games
i think this app is alot of fun to use and play . i like the graphics and the different levels .
if you like to play solitaire , this game is for you . user friendly , and a great way to relax after a long day at work .
i love this game so much is very exciting to play and teens my age would adore this game ! their is facebook connection on this game also
very enjoyable just like being in las vegas only you do n't get to keep the money you win . hours of fun right at your finger tips .
it 's great to have this challenging ( frustrating ! ) game on my kindle . i 've enjoyed it on my computer for quite a while so being able to take it with me is a treat .
really fun game and a quick way to pass some time . only bad thing is you have to pay for extra coins .
this is a good game but there are many more games out there a lot like this one . i think this game needs its own little twist .
cute game but it has issues . stops working ; wo n't . open etc . too many animals require mini bucks which u have too purchase .
lets me do what i need to do , and has a fair amount of functionality available when using on a normal pc .
free and gives a look of htc sense plus lots of other options . you can pay for more options as well as download lots of free skins for the clock and weather and such
fun app . if u like old school mario you will really like this ! not one problem on my kindle fire .
this app is wonderful for my kindle fire . the ease with which i can post to my pinterest page is great . i just have to share to the pinterest app and away it goes to my boards .
ok. still like original birds the best . just ca n't get into this one . not a big star wars fan anyways . even seasons was more fun .
would n't work correctly on my kindle . graphics was not very good . slow at loading . it would probably be a good game if it did n't have the glitches .
this app . is okay , not what i was thinking ... . i guess i need to read the information better next time .
i can not see where it does much . i do not see it run . i have to go in and run it , it needs to run itself so i do n't have to .
pretty good game for the money . graphics could be better . i feel like i got a good game for the price . hope there is a part 2 ! !
having fun learning this game , i have it on my iphone and really like it , alittle different on this apt . but will enjoy learning all the game can do
really enjoyed this brain teaser . lots of fun for the whole family . i would recommend this if you like a game with a twist .
i have a low end android 2 device and this is the first game we found that always works . easy to pick up and good for killing time .
this is the best game every when i had first started this it got me amazed . this is the best game every
i rated this as & # 34 ; it 's okay & # 34 ; because some games are just not like the real thing on a kindle . it 's fun but not awesome .
the are you smarter than a 5th grader was a very fun app that i enjoyed playing , i would recommend this game to everyone .
very very very nice game . i like this game . its fun . it is a good game for girls . get this game
i play solitaire quite a bit and this is very easy to use . i would definitely recommend it to my friends
this game is challenging , but so much fun . i could play this all day . i especially like to play the same people in multiple games . this is a classic game for all
i am glad i downloaded this news channel like to watch both news stations to keep up to date and it 's easier to watch on my kindle fire .
good game good graphics works great on my fire : ) great value for the price lots of puzzles and hidden object play
this game is terribly awesome . it 's very addictive . i play on my kindle hd and i love it ! great quests , cute animals , and sweet bosses . could n't get better !
i have n't received my order to the price is right slots so i do not know how to rate it , please help me
love this app . i like how you can touch the screen and make fireworks appear . i would definitely recommend to a friend . : )
what a great alarm clock app ! ! ! i love being able to customize the different alarms i use everyday . it 's never let me down .
i think i may quit getting free game apps . i have yet to be happy with them , with the exception of angry birds .
i did not like this version of boggle . i downloaded word 4 word which i like very much better . thanks .
i had fun with this but had some trouble sometimes figuring out what i was supposed to do in tight spots . a few more instructions would have been nice . but i would buy more from this company .
this is my favorite weather app . it has so much info and is so easy to use . it 's a quick way to check the weather . just love it .
i thought it could do more . i have n't used this app that much . the kindle software upgrade does about the same as this app
i like how smooth this game is to play . relaxed mode challenges in a , well , relaxing way . great game for quick play or for longer periods if you have the time .
it 's ok , but so far , it 's not what i thought it would be . maybe it will get better , i do n't know .
plan on taking it off my kindle fire . not a game i will play ... not a lot to it or something
great game ca n't beat it best blackjack game ive ever played . play it all the time great time waster you should buy
fun word game . not sure yet if it gets more challenging . would definitely recommend . can be played by young and old . wish you could choose different levels .
i chose a rating of 5 stars because this is a very good game . the response is very good . it is a pleasure to play .
cute game to spend your time playing while waiting in the dr 's office . keeps you busy and the time goes by fast : ) plus it made laugh : )
this game is awesome ! but i wish it was easier to gain life style points it 's so hard i do n't know who to earn them : /
im 13 and its so fun to me to play with when im so bored and there is nothing else to do
this is an awesome app . its perfect for when you are bored and just need something to do it gives you a selection of challenges . !
not so good . as a matter of fact , i deleted it the same day !
i do n't think this game was very challenging . i am glad they let me play it for a while before i had to pay , because i deleted it when it came to that part .
this is the best game in the world its even better than angry birds ! its exactly like mario except way better !
i wish it had more coins other than that i love it great game best coin pushing game yet ... . luv it
i find it hard to quit playing this game . it is very close to the pc version - maybe better since i do n't have to use the mouse .
if you have kids or grand kids that like fish this is the puzzle for them . mine really like it
i was playing this today , and i could n't stop playing because it was so addicting ! you should rely get this app it 's fun , cool , and free .
love this game . have so much fun playing . only problem is that you go through credits way to fast other than that a great game .
i love the interface ! the graphics are incredible ! my daughter loves this game and there are multiple levels so she does n't get bored ! i definitely recommend this game for the educational value ! great game !
this is a fun and addicting game . when it first came out i thought it was pretty cool . its still fun ! you should try it out and then if you like it , buy the full version
kind of hard . but once you go through it you catch on and it makes sense . spooky and cheesy but good hope there is a sequel .
i really like this game . its a lot of fun but so far pretty easy , least for me . still really fun though lol
love it and my kids actually get into it as well i would recommend this to anyone that likes a good challenge
there is really nothing wrong with this game , it just was n't what i expected it to be ... more of a child 's game .
love this game . it is awesome because it has better graphics than flappy bird . absolutely love this game ! ! # amazing
this game is so fun ! you can complete achievements and battle . my favorite part of this game is seeing the creative kinds of dragons put into this game . i recommend this game to everyone !
this version is up to date but the format is what makes it a great app . you can quickly find the book and chapter you need which is handy in a class situation .
good way to find deals but not very often do i pick one up . window shopping deals and seeing what 's out there .
this game is awesome ! its so fun ! fast paced and exciting . cute graphics , great sound effects , and just plain fun to play . thanks amazon for giving it to us for free !
this game is really fun ! ! its like mario for you kindle ! must have app for your kindle because it is awesome
i like this game but the things take to long but its fun and addicting so why the bad reviews .
allows me to listen to music when i read on my kindle or just as some music when i am in a spot where i ca n't get access to my radio .
i have tried other pinterest apps but none have been a accurate and efficient as this one . i would recommend this app for anyone
i gave it three stars because i am used to nine numbers instead of six . it was easy and colorful to play .
i hate having to buy coins to play a game on my kindle . i have uninstalled it and will not buy this type of app again .
this is a fun game to play while killing a bit of time . the games are not too challenging but just challenging enough to keep interesting .
luckily this was a free app , because i finished it really quickly . this was n't much of a challenge at all .
not bad game play all though the controls are a little sticky . it is a little difficult trying to aim and move but can be fun .
i wanted a full piano to play and this was not it . it reminded me more of a kids piano .
i have played this game for ever ... ..it 's fun fun fun ... ... play it it 's hard but you learn to get along i love happy happy ...
the game was fun until i could n't figure out a response . then i could n't move forward . that was very disappointing .
escape games are usually too hard for me . this is a collection of short , easier versions of the genre . you only have to beat one room at a time . pretty satisfying .
this game could be so much fun , but it 's absolutely terrible . i just downloaded the new update hoping for better controls but no . this game is n't even playable on the kindle !
i loved playing this as a child . now my children play this very addictive game and they love it . i recommend this game for the whole family .
i think that this is a cute fun little game . so what it is repetitive but killing zombies is fun ! ! ! my 6 year old plays it as much as i do !
great app ! i love that i do n't have to be online to use it . i compared points to the books to make sure it was accurate and it is .
so awesome ! certainly worth the free ! i definitely recommend this application to anyone looking for an exciting game . great job .
was like all other hidden games out there really no bonus and not very interesting and s slow to respond
i am completely addicted to this game . watching tv is not the same without playing this game also . try it you will love it also .
playing this game is really fun because there is a story line to follow and the hidden items are not extremely hard to find . have good time .
good game ... do n't like to buy coins ... good time waster if your bored ... . a little too easy for adults but good learning game for kids .
just started playing this a day or so ago . the early rounds are easy but it gets hard - though not so hard that you give it up . challenging & amp ; addictive ! !
i think this game is pretty good is easy to learn how to play and it 's challenging but not too challenging so i 'm rating it 5 stars .
i love this game its so fun everybody should get it . i wish it was free though . it keeps u busy
i wish it kept stats and perhaps added a random phase quick game feature for when you really only have a few moments .
started playing and could not stop ! each level brings different challenges . great graphics . first few levels are really easy to beat !
it 's a decent app . i rather use the one finger instead of the buttons . i got this app for free . works fine on my kindle fire hd .
great hidden object on my kindle fire ! ! would highly recommend this game for anyone who loves hidden objects ! ! great job big fish ! !
this is a wonderful little time killer that just gets under your skin until you figure out the system for each level . it gets progressively tougher as you level and keeps your attention quite nicely .
this is a good game , although at sometimes i just ca n't seem to get into it . to be fair , i have n't had much time to play it .
i downloaded this for my 3 year old not knowing how much he would be interested in this , but he seems to enjoy it a lot . he really likes to play with this and count along .
if you love bingo then you will love this game . powerups and all kinds of surprises make it fun . it 's one of my favorites .
it may be for 9 and younger but for someone who 's not good at playing the piano it definitely helps . i enjoyed playing songs on it . it 's small but is a good time waster
i really enjoy playing this game . it is rather addicting . i would recommend it to all of my friends . it would be nice it did n't require internet access .
this game required too much data that i was willing to use , this game would be perfect , if it did n't require soon much data !
i love it . it is just this so easy and good quality app . if you just give it a minute it will load from your kindle fire 's gallery .
the game is challenging but gets rather boring with out a challenge to over come i would rather see the letters change .
if you like a lot of hidden objects this game is for you ! it 's got lots plus many challenging puzzles looking forward to the sequel
i have hulu , so it is a great distraction for me at work during my lunch time and that 's all i ever wanted .
ok so there are ads but you can skip them press the x button in the corner and the skip button will come up i have no problem with it i 'm really people stop complaining
love these games but the time i spent downloading it was n't worth the time i spent playing it . very short .
i love puzzles and these r good and challenging . i 'm having a blast . my kids like it too . you will enjoy this game
i love solitaire , and this is definitely the best one out there . it 's easy to use and i love the multiplayer mode .
i love this game its fun and cool i wish there were more ! ! ! ! ! ! this game is super cute i love the panda and the penguin
i got this one for my husband to play . he loves pool and says the game is fun . the colors on the kindle fire hdx make this one gorgeous too .
i play this often and enjoy it more each time i play . i would encourage anyone to download it . lots of fun .
i think this is a great game . so far i am doing pretty darn good but it does slowly get harder . i just enjoy the game . try it out i think most people would like it .
as someone that 's played a lot of card games , this one is awesome ! have n't had any problems at all . easy to read
i love this game so much ! ! ! i feel like i have a real pet and everything . and it 's so much fun to do too . : )
this is a very fun game and really neat to play . i have played all 4 levels and won most of them .
fantastic game . keeps you playing and playing . recommend to purchase . i really enjoy playing this game . good for the mind .
great app really fun reminds me of pokemon from when i was a child can not wait to reach a higher level
i put it on my kids tablet because he asked . i never played it and now i am hooked . installed easy .
google search is okay but i much prefer to use it on my computer and will continue to do so .
ca n't really review since it wont load up . it will try to install but it crashes . it has bugs need fixing .
everyone in the family enjoy playing this game we like the games that is available for us to play thank you .
i love angry birds space . it 's so addictive . it 's one of the best games around for children and adults . : - )
i enjoy playing bingo . this game is fun but i would like it . much more if it was not always hitting me to buy .
this game is so addicting and fun i ca n't put it down . works very well on my kindle fire . the graphics are awesome and the objectives give you something to work towards . love it .
on kindle it says . when you type a word there is no enter button so i do n't know what to do
thought i found a nice free app to give me some workout ideas , but it seems like everything cost on this app . the only thing free is the download .
a great little game for dragon lovers . i would prefer it to have a bit more to it , but they are still working on it .
good radio app to have . stations f all types of people . you will love this app and use it all the time day and night . at home are in the car .
my little girl will be on it for days trying to get past it but she loves it . it is the best game ever
this is a very good app . it is well designed and it works very well with the original kindle fire . i recommend that you give it a try .
the kids really enjoy this game . it is different and challenging . felt it needed a few more instructions but once they figured it out they loved it .
i do not recommend that you get this game because there 's nothing fun about it . and there is nothing you can do about it .
i 've not found a way to check to see if i am right or if i need to make a change . it may just need better directions .
great graphics & amp ; cute puzzles . fun to play . good idea with the titanic as the background . would recommend . to anyone
this is another game that is good for young reader and for adults . it is exercise for the brain in a fun way
the name made me laugh but i enjoy playing it after work or with my niece when i 'm at home she makes the sound while i play games i enjoy this product
top free games means its supposed to be for free . the kf apps suck too there is nothing fun yet
man i got the game and it was fun for a day that 's why i recommend you to play ice age village it 's way better so i just wan na say this game is junk its crap
i 'm glad that candy crush has finally come to the great variety of games available on the kindle . it is an awesome and addictive game !
it works like your browser messenger . i like that its exactly what i expect and works the way i want every time .
subway surfers ! ! ! i love this game . ca n't stop playing this . have to get it
i had fun playing this one and my 4 year old really enjoys feeding candy to the lil green monster
unlimited difficulties that you control ! will keep you as busy as you want . what else could you want for free ? works flawlessly ! worth money even if not free !
this game is additive and well worth 5 stars but you have to leave room for improvement . i find myself playing this instead of reading .
wonderful game to spend some time , awesome rpg cant get any better . i need more games like this ... any more ideas for the kindle fire
the game looked nice , but i could n't find a zoom feature ( which i need ! ) on my tablet some objects were to small to find .
i did the nails right and they get mad . i have no clue why they get mad . do not get this game ! ! !
this games really give you a chance to make your brain work , and i like it better then brain games .
my grandson wants the game it wo n't load . i tried three times . other games load not this one . he would likes the game .
this game is the right balance between creepy and addictive . it has really good graphics and a very good storyline .
keeps stopping , just like the scrabble , which is not a good game either . a lot of these free games just waste your time when you could be reading or playing something more interesting .
what more can you say about it ? it does what it does . i 'm very happy with this app ! if anyone is n't happy with , must be looking for a different type of app .
i like the game but seem to run out of & quot ; energy & quot ; before i want to stop playing . and i refuse to pay for things . other than that game is fun .
i love this game . whoever uses my kindle always plays it too . it is very addictive and play it everyday .
i really enjoy playing this game as it makes you need to use your brain to figure out the plays .
super fun and kinda hard at first . loved it so much . this game is very fun to play and i love playing it when i can .
great game ! ! ! you get to do a lot on this game from arcade to cooking . you have to pass games to get points . overall very fun ! !
i love this one ! i have played this on facebook , but love the mobile much better ! highly recommending ! ! ! download & amp ; enjoy !
this game is so fun . you should really get this game . my only complaint is that there should be more levels . other than that , it 's great !
if you like a challenge you 'll like this app . some are easy some are hard still thinking is always good .
neither of my grandsons ages 6 and 8 are interested in this one . they have only tried it once . i guess there is not enough action for them .
me and my sisters love to bakery story on our kindle fires . we even have each others as neighbors . to anyone i suggest you get the game .
i like this version and it still entertains the toddlers . we were disappointed that the kindle does n't support the star wars version but this is good too .
like the android app . easier to get to ebay and check on things . told several friends about it and i believe they got it also .
this game is so fun and so addictive ! i ca n't stop playing ! i love playing against so many other people
this is really a nice little app . works just like the puzzles you used to do on the card table .
got this for my 2 year old and he loves it . my 7 year old plays it every now and then too .
lots of funny love it challenge enough for the mind free version plus the $ 1.99 purchase does n't have enough levels to enjoy
i 'm so glad i can finally i can play this game without having to look around the ads . great game and very addicting .
i downloaded this for myself . i love playing mahjong and word games in general . my eleven year old grand daughter also likes playing it
this game is very fun and addicting . it 's a great game to play when your board . i seriously recommend this game .
i like the game very much .i like playing . i would recommend it to anyone who love to play word games
this is a fun hidden object game that is very clear on my new 8 & # 34 ; tablet . graphics are great and i would recommend this to anyone who likes ho 's .
i would have given it a half but i was generous it sucks you can barely do anything they should pay u t o play it just do n't buy it
i find the songs i like and enjoy i really recommend this to you get it it so free i recommend it real bad
l love playing quell ... lots of fun ! ! ! it makes you use your mind and challenges you to see how well you can think .
this game is really boring and does not capture my attention for long . do n't buy it , its dumb . i was lucky i got it for free .
this app sucks if you have a fire it cant tell if i 'm touching the screen or not and its very slow . do n't waste your time i deleted it right away .
this is one of my favorite games on my kindle . it is very challenging and fun . the only thing that i would have to complain about is that there are n't that many free games .
this has been a every helpful tool especially when looking up word i can not find in the bible 's dictionary 's , is awesome to have around
be warned this game is more than addicting . at first i thought this game was going to be boring but wow was i wrong .
this game is very good . you have to know your cars . mainly the foreign cars . its very challenging and educational
again i did not enjoy this slot . but , someone else might like it . gave it a try for a few weeks .
it does have alot of different styles to pick from . try it out i am sure you will enjoy it . samsung epic
this game is fun and challenging . its nice because you do n't have to wait for your friend to make a move like the popular scrabble games out there .
if you were hoping to find a pocket check register that does n't even need you to find a pen , here it is . you can load and enter everything and know where you stand when .
not the best camera in the world . the camera that comes in the diary app is better . but not too bad
very nice and relaxing . very even and easy pace . the music in the background is well paced with the game .
it failed to download after trying 3 times , so i uninstalled it . it seemed to hard to install and asked too many questions before it would complete the installation .
used it one time to scan a smart ad and never used it again . i probably could have used it more .
i love this game . makes you really think about things . there are some that are a little hard to do but still a lot of fun .
ca n't beat the price , many settings , options , easy fun , different levels , some screens were good , others were kinda lame & stupid , all & all , it 's worth playing .
downloaded for my great granddaughter and i do n't think its what it says or does what what i expected . do n't waste your kindle space .
great game and a little challenging ! ! ! ! i love it and its sooooo addicting . i would play all night if i could ! ! ! ! get this game ! ! ! ! ! ! !
brain teasers for all situations - good on the go , great when you have time to fill , like in the airport or in a traffic jam
able to watch movies and some television shows on the go when i travel . definitely would recommend this app if you already subscribe to netflix .
this game will kill time , but it is nothing exciting or worth writing home about . play it if you have nothing better to do .
fun to play , with some challenges , but it 's not too hard ! = ) you can get through quite a few levels fairly quick .
highly recommend ! ! more app then expected , money well spent . can do endless hours and so many possibilities . i feel like a kid in a candy store ... lol
nice game and really cool graphics . plays very easily . i got it for free , but would pay for this game .
i got this app for my grandkids to play with . it 's totally useless , does nothing , and had no point . or ... i just did n't use it right ? ? you decide .
i have been looking for a free slot game that i could play without having to buy more credits and so far i havent spent any real cash
this game is free in the google play store . at the very least they should have removed the ads on this paid application for amazon .
it is a amazing game ... it is awesome design they create and it is mostly cool game go play so i suggest u try this game ...
this app is the best ever and i love games like this go get the game u will like it so much
not very fond of this game because there seems to be no method to it and not a lot of brain use
i did n't really care too much for this game . it was fun the first couple times but after that it kind of got boring .
playing g this on a kindle fire . graphics are beautiful . i played this before on a laptop but it 's so much better on the kindle . well done
i love playing this app its so fun ! you should get this app its amazing . you should get it and play it passes the time !
this is a great app you create your own skin an you can download it to pc edition it really works on pc sadly not on pocket edition but other wise it 's great !
this game is a challenge to me , therefore i can play it and is a lot better than some of the other games i have tried
i love this game it is fun and relaxing easy to use just like the real slots great way to relax in the evening
love it . provides lots of laughs , kudos to the devs . ca n't wait to see their next project . who knew not playing a game would be so entertaining ?
love it . i would say it close to my favorite bingo game ! at least my second to favorite . this game keeps me up late !
i like it i finally found one that works well . it does what i want and finds the words i need !
my kids completed this game in a matter of minutes and were done with it . they wanted a new game . i will be more careful of my choices in the future .
.this is a relaxing game . i really enjoy playing it i play just to slow down my evening s. anyone can do it pretty easy game
this is a great game . very addictive but i love it . i start playing and have a hard time putting it down .
play it every day ! ! ! i live on a boat so i play with friends all over the country and keep in touch ! ! ! ! !
good game so far . not too hard yet , but i am not to far into the game . good game for the free price .
this app is very useful since its hard for me to get on a computer . i recommend this app to anyone who likes funny videos or music or any other kind of video .
seriously the best app i have ! i use it all the time ! fast and easy . this is the app for you . ; )
it is very cool because you can actually put all your favorite and private stuff in there like the best thing that 's ever happened to you .
i love this game but it needs to be free ! ! ! i looked at the pics and i got all the logos right ! everyone wants it to be free so get it free people !
so cool with the sounds and everything . supper awesome get this app i know you will enjoy it like me
very disappointed . i was unable to navigate through this app and i was unable to find what i wanted to watch .
this game is more of a game for a little kid to be playing . i thought it was cute but just not for me at all
i downloaded this app so that i could check out books from my local library . it 's the best thing i ever did for my kindle
definitely challenging ! this game gives an escape challenge . the clues are fun to find and makes you think where u might find them . i would recommend this game : )
this is a fun game i enjoy that you do n't have to work hard or pay out of pocket a lot to play
thought this would have better word searches . unfortunately they seem to use the same words over and over again . and really they have you search for a few words which leaves most of the letters not used .
needed something on my surprise gift ... kindle fire hd . this is a great game . play it while talking on the phone .
listen it 's not bad but not what i thought . i had it for a while but then it got really boring . this is a maybe app .
boring ... do n't understand the point of the game . more information would be helpful ... and a goal for playing the game . thank you .
particularly good game really hard to guess the logos though so good thing they gave us hints yay yeah this game rocks
someone may enjoy this game but it depends on your taste . i just happened to not enjoy it you may .
brings you back but wish you could skip and go back to it later . some things never seen before . needs more coins for solving .
this is sooooooooo much better than the original temple run . i love the new obstacles . i would highly recommend it .
i like the game but it just freezes up on me when i try to move on to the next level so its really annoying but the game works fine .
more then just hidden object scenes . this game is great and never boring . you can flip from puzzles to hidden objects and so much more . plenty of variety .
its not as much fun as some of the other hidden objects games i have . my grandson does not play it very much and i base my rating on him
i do n't understand this game . i tried to find instructions and was not able to follow how the game should be played . it looks like it would be fun if i could figure it out .
a fun card game . this helps to improve your skills and strategies . simple and fast paced , i find it relaxing .
this game reminds me of the atari games . good for game for all ages . easy controlling on kindle fire . way to go developers
i found that all ages will enjoy this game . my grand kids to me we all enjoy all the angry bird games
have seen on t.v . got it on my kindle , grandkids and i all have fun playing it . i think you will find it fun .
this is a fun app get it it 's very fun do n't like the advertising at all fun though and entertaining
if you like to play bingo , you will probably like this app . it is a lot of fun . however , it tends to lock up quite a bit .
this game is adorable , but i 'd enjoy it a lot more if i could exit the item store without having to exit and reload the game ...
love the graphics and games ! ! super fun and very addictive the only thing is that i run out of coins ... lol
if you like bingo games , this one is just as straight forward as the rest of them . i like it ... its fun .
a fun game that everyone can love . the only problem was when changing the background it sticks and does not respond . however it never stops me from having fun
it is a great game . i love playing it for hours and hours all night long day or night . that is how much fun it is
did n't know how i gave it a bad review before . love the app . works great on kindle fire hd . the remote feature and being able to watch tv on kindle great ! !
my son loves dinosaurs , and this app is good for telling him the name of them with a picture . he does n't care for the coloring pages , and gets bored quick with it .
is just a basic time management game ... is cute , but repetitive . i uninstalled 10 minutes later due to lack of interest
i use this app on a weekly basis to find local sales and organize shopping trips . i would highly recommend this app to anyone .
i have n't gotten very far into it yet , its been a challenge having to start over and trying to get just alittle bit further each time .
game is great , i even play it on my android phone , and never have had a problem with it ... .. awesomeness ! ! !
great game . enjoy the speed so you can play 4 cards easily . like watching the cat too ! the graphics are n't typical . feels like you 're on vacation !
this is a great utility to have for your kindle . it gets rid of junk files that slow down your tablet .
i love this `` game '' . there have not been any technical problems with it . would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes word games .
it 's addictive . i play all the time . wish it were easier to get coins to play though . otherwise it 's a good game to pass time .
one of the better free games i 've played . the ai does some dumb things but overall i recommend it . it seems good for kids too .
i did n't see a difference in between this angry birds and any other version that was out there . it was a decent game , and it was exactly what i expected it to be .
i have tried to play some of the action games on my tablet and in my opinion , puzzle games are about the best for tablets period .
its pretty entertaining , tic tac toe is n't my favorite game but it kept me playing for alittle . i play it every now and then
i love this game its a must buy game its addicting and hard u must get the game its so fun
me and my family love this game we play it alot . it takes alot of brain power for each level .
this app is awesome . i do n't really like city building games but this is just awesome . if your a simpson 's fan you 'll really love this app . get it now .
i think that this app is awesome ! i can text my friends for free and i can also just hang out
it 's very very cool you should try this i 'm going to and i love it it 's a must have get it it 's a good game for children 8 and up
i love this game and i love the movie too ! it 's awesome , everyone should try this game . just like the movie !
just . was not the one i wanted . was looking for one i had on my old ipod , this was n't it .
have not used it as of yet . have used pdf on my pc will use it in the future . thanks
cute idea but things take to long to do and things are to expensive . graphics are nice and the music is ok .
this game is very entertaining . it was hard for me to stop playing so i could write this review . the story plot is good and i like how it keeps you going and wanting more .
well i actually think that basically everything is pretty nice on this besides one huge fact , which is the controls just plain suck . everything else is good but i would n't suggest getting this game .
this is really nice if you need to know a few words in spanish . its nice for children . i love it .
there are a few puzzles that offer a good challenge to earn three stars . i am still working on them .
i love this game so so much i used to play this game on my iphone but now i can play it on my kindle fire thank u amazon appstore
i like this game because it relaxes me after a stressful day at work . you do n't have to think to hard to connect the dots .
