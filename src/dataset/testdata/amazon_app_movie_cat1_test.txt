excellent movie . i have watched it a few different times and it always keeps me on the edge of my seat .
in my quest to buy as many christmas movies as possible i found a gem in this one . quite the twist in the end that makes this movie worth purchasing .
my husband and i love this show . i ca n't wait till they put all the seasons onto dvds so we can get every episode .
this was excellent , could n't stop watching , had to watch all discs to finish it . the only sad thing is that it ended that part of the saga , and there was n't any more .
i think this is a great show . mike is correct ... somebody 's got ta do it . i have learned much from watching mike dig into some very dirty and sometimes dangerous jobs .
i have watched lots of movies about this queen and this was well done . great costumes , scenery and story . they are each different in detail but interesting . i really liked this version .
these were all great . i loved the show when it was on tv . then i watched them all again on netflix . now i can watch them whenever i want . thank you for having them available .
a must have for your christmas movie collection , funny , entertaining and a great story line .
this was a gift for my cousin and i hope she like it , enjoy workout with this dvd it will be her first time to this one she would like it ! ! !
my mother was reading this book and i just had to check out the movie . cheesy , but a good message . i would watch it again , for the whole family .
i have this dvd and absolutely love it ! i enjoyed this star wars cartoon series as a child and still do today ! !
tom and jerry have alot of good and funny cartoons that you can watch more than once i recommend it
just a few good action scenes and a few dialog / suspence scenes . the plot was fairly solid . the acting is a little stiff in this movie , but all considered , it was an ok time .
at first i did n't think i was going to like this kind a movie . i knew i was going to enjoy kevin hart 's comedic acting . he did a great job .
did not know anything about it so i watch it and liked it . i do recommend plus it was free .
this film version stands as my all-time favorite of the genre and perhaps the entire 70s . i will enjoy this one for a lifetime .
this is a cartoon kind of movie done with real people . a great cast is the one thing that really makes this film . the humor is a little dated but funny .
peter jackson has done it again . one of my favorite movies of all time . i love a long movie that is not rushed , wish they all were 3 hours plus .
was expecting more like the book . i did n't like the casting much either . was okay but not the best in my opinion
i love all the old time shows that you ca n't get on tv so i am purchasing this collection and i am almost there .
my daughters had fun watching superman . it allowed me to share pleasant childhood viewing with them when i watched it over with them .
good times , second season seem to deal with more issues that are real and part of everyday life .
i liked the screen play and the actors but the language was messed with not at all close to what is written in the bible
this was a gift purchase . i have heard no complaints so this blu-ray must have been in good shape . cant wait to view it !
i really like gerard butler as an actor , he does a good job . he taught the young man great lessons in life .
glad to finally have the complete show all the seasons are great . one of the best shows ever love it
excellent show . house is very funny . this is my favorite show and i watch the episodes over and over . highly recommend it .
perfect in three parts , though number 3 left a lot to be desired . author should have stopped at two . good addition to my collection .
this is my absolute favorite movie of all time -- - i love richard gere ! julia roberts gives a perfect performance of grace and style in this movie -- - a must have for romance individuals .
i 'd never saw it in hd before and am glad i bought it ! ( and this is a much better film then the remake ) .
i bought this collection after i saw indiana 4 , it was great deal for fun movies
bought this as a gift . they loved it . i would recommend this to anyone who was into this type of stuff .
i use to watch is everytime it would snow with my brother when we were younger . i am so happy they put it on dvd . it really gets you into the holiday spirit !
good , just like i remembered it as a kid growing up . story ahead of its time but fairly accurate for today .
as always denzel comes through with his performance in this film . good , strong cast of characters and a good plot . i would recommend this film for anyone who enjoy bourne or similar type movies .
excellent movie . i first saw on tv , wanted a copy , waited 8 years to get a dvd of it . love the movie . a great story , a happy ending , and nice people throughout .
it kept both the adults and children entertained . it really is a great movie . it 's funny & kind of heartwarming
my movie collection is growing . all my favorites from days gone by . i can watch them over and over . thanks
interesting premise , but i just couldnt get into it . i dont know why but i just couldnt . they are making either a sequal or a follow up .
my favorite in the world of comedy . even if the scenes and events are not that funny , larry 's character always is . love the man .
if you 're a halloween or michael myers fan , this must be a part of your collection . great typical slasher horror movie !
great movie . very entertaining . great mixture of action , horror , sexual tension , and comedy . my favorite kind of movie . i bought it so i could watch it again .
it 's probably the best action movie of all times . extremely enjoyable to watch . just so cool ! i watched it on netflix and going to buy my copy now . wow
i love this movie when i was a child i watched it repeatedly . i bought it for my niece she loves it and always talks about sarah .
denzel is always a joy to watch ; but this movies was just not what i expected . this movie is more a personal drama .
as usual , i am satisfied with everything . i received the product in a timely manner . thanks
when i purchased the dvd of this i received this instant video , have n't seen this so i am unable to rate it .
the second season does not disappoint , you are introduced to new characters and learn new things about the old ones . i like the writing and that there are a lot of episodes .
this is a great snow storm movie . this is a more believeable spin on the classic tale . the scenery is fantastic . a definite see again .
very interesting concept . fun to watch , exciting at times and thought provoking . good entertainment , however not an award winner . worth a look .
a great movie with lots of jokes and a great cast . i highly recommend this video . it 's nice to see something this inventive not based on a comic book .
this was a movie i had been wanting to see for several years , but somehow missed over the years . i 'm glad i finally got to watch it as it was well worth the wait .
the cast of characters , their adventures , the acting , writing and setting all combine to make this quite possibly the best show on tv anywhere ever !
i enjoyed this series when i was younger it was fun to repeat the experience all over again thanks for it
i bought this as a christmas present ( surprise ) for my mom . we both love law & order , and were not disappointed at all .

this is a classic snl . i love the movie and was pleased to find it new and for a great price . it arrived very quickly , packaged well and has been a wonderful addition to my collection .

this movie has the best car chases and is full of action . this one will also keep you on your toes and is a great classic .
my grandkids and me loved this movie . its funny , colorful . my grandkids and me saw it a couple of times again . and when we want laugh we look it up .
very nice touching movie . animations are getting better and better . getting them through amazon is great . prices are good and delivery times are wonderful .
i have read the book and it was great , but this made me cry . a very wholesome movie that i recommend to anyone .
this was one of the first movies i saw with my children . i would by this for sentimental reasons . two thumbs up !
great to finally see a version of this with good picture and sound . even though it has it 's corny spots , it 's still fun to watch .
recently started watching this series , and it is super cute . a little over dramatic at some points , but that 's the point . good series .
loved tom selleck in this movie , saw it on cable and had to get it , his role looked so real .
very enjoyable movie and very well done . i 'm an adult but i really liked it - so it 's not just for kids . very nice to look at too on a good hd tv .
i like the effects and the monsters . i hope when they make a sequel they will have vampires and werewolves that does n't look like those in underworld movie .
do not watch this film by yourself . must be watched in a group or you will shoot yourself .
my kids and me just love this movie . it is a great family christmas movie to watch as a family ! ! !
a good movie for all , i bought this movie so i could watch it with my kids . to my surprise it entertained me also .
this is the way movies should be put together and all can enjoy and be a family that can watch a movie together and teach good moral ways also
the golden girls is one of the best american tv sitcoms ever made . every fan should have all nine seasons on dvd !
a great story ... notice the all star cast , and good acting ( as always ) by robert redford . worth the time , worth the $
this series was a gift to my dad , who loved the show when it was on tv . he was very happy with it .
this is the one actor movie i have ever watched . could have been just a little better , but turned out great
i recomend this movie to all s f fans . it has great special effects , especially in three dee . good flick .
great movie , a classic , i like it , great characters , the ending is worth the whole flick you will love the ending
i really like naruto . it came on time . i really happy with it . i would tell my friends about it .
an incredible movie ! a must see ! i cant remember the actors name , but the one who plays his business partner was fabulous .
i have never had an issue with any of the dvd 's i have purchased , and i have purchased quite a few . i am a satisfied customer .
good movie , the plot was a lot better than i expected , i never read the book , so i really did n't know what to expect .
do n't know how i missed this one . was a treat to watch . funny and sharp . do n't have comics like this anymore
same as season 1 , just more depth to characters . still a good series
condition was perfect as promised . arrived on time , very happy with product . price was the best i could find for blue ray .
enjoyed this one , richard gere is at his best as usual . you ca n't go wrong with most any of his movies .
from a time when actors had to act and special effects were generated from within . you feel you could have lived next door .
this is just the best movie and remains a classic for all of the member of the family to enjoy .
i would recommend this movie . we found it `` fun '' , humorous and enjoyed the plot even though it was not what we were expecting . it did flow well and kept our interest .
my husband and i thought this was a good family movie , there are n't many i would watch with grand kids .
old tom cruise love story , was very bored and wanted something to watch . the story was kind of shallow at points but it was still fun to watch .
this is a good way to get 3 bruce willis films . all 3 are good movies . i got them at a good price , in new condition and on time .
both specific to time and culture and universal in its themes of love , family , work and purpose . i enjoyed every moment of this gem !
when i first saw the trailer , before it 's release . i thought , what is pixar up to ? they always come through with a beautifully animated , well executed story . i love this movie .
i enjoyed working out to this video and will continue using it for weight loss and to get in shape .
the latest in the fast and furious saga is a fast moving movie . very good special effects , the story is not bad either . tom
great remake ! we love the action in this movie as well as the special effects . not your old stallone movie !
what the heck ! i ca n't believe i actually sat through the whole thing . possibly worst movie i have ever seen .
just love the first and second seasons so it made sense to get the third . there are some really great moments in each episode with laugh out loud humor .
this could 've been alot better in my personal opinion . you ca n't take bruce willis ' mouth and cgi it onto joseph gordon 's face ! ! !
a wonderful movie for kids and the kid in all of us ! the first one is one of my favorite movies of all time .
i love shirley ! this is one of her best dramas vs. musical . her chemistry is good with robert young , and she even does well with foreign language . a must for a shirley temple collector .
this was a gift and i was so excited to know that someone still had a copy of this movie ! it came in top-notch condition and on time !
i love all the men in black movie and movies with tommy lee jones and will smith , they both are good actor and they just make the movies good and funny .
i enjoyed the first collection so much i decided i wanted to view the second collection . so far it is exactly what i expected .
this movie had the potential to be much better . i enjoyed it . however there was something lacking more action and a better story line it was n't great but it was n't terrible .
if you like real westerns like it should be , one of the best , and not one of these wan na be so called westerns , hey ! ! it do n't come any better then this ! !
love this movie ! ! ! it is sad ... but the ending is great . i am a huge tyler perry fan ! ! !
great show but i wish cbs would have put out a box set instead of cheap dvd case . anyone getting season 6 of walker will find out how cheap they have gotten .
finally , a film that tells a good story about what it means to be a family , with excellent writing and brilliant acting . this should be on everyone 's top ten must see list for the year .
did n't know if i would like the new sherlock holmes but found it very enjoyable ! great acting by benedict cumberbatch .
not my favorite spike lee movie , but near the top of his game ... this is a must see move . it 's history baby !
good movie it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it isnt was to t
this came out of no where for me . excellent character movie even though it is rather short . worth the purchase for me .
the whole sci-fi part of the movie was amazing . the graphics and effects were great too . me and my kids enjoyed this movie very much .
came across this and watched as soon as it arrived ! ! a must see for a baseball lover ! ! arrived on time with no scratches
a mix between mr. bean and masterpiece theatre . a bit odd , but we really enjoyed watching it and looking forward to watching more episodes .
it was a sad day for me when they just took csi : miami off the air . i really miss that show . it had really beautiful scenery , wonderful actors and good stories .
belly dance is great for all ages to do . i recommend it to anyone who wants to have fun and get fit .
this is a family favorite . i remember watching it as a kid and still love it . the songs are great and the dancing is so much fun , i miss this kind of movie : (
i like both versions equally . the original had atmosphere , the remake had better looking zombies . all in all , i highly recommend this movie . check it out !
usually movies get worse as they go , but we thought this one was even better than the first two . totally worth it !
perfect gift for someone i know who enjoys this show , and i watch it from time to time and see why he does like it
i am not a fan of live cd 's , i must say . but the fact that this came with a dvd also was awesome ! i love the music , but loved the dvd even more !
i did not like this and could not make it through the whole movie . there did n't seem to be a good story line or anything to hang on to keep me watching .
this is an edge of the seat movie with a lot of twists . hart to tell the good guys from the bad ones . i would recommend it .
good british fun and very true to life i lived in the uk and this was typical just a funny funny show
great music . i think it may be a personal taste . i enjoyed the rock guitar playing from some of the best players out there .
enjoy watching this series again and again . we are so happy it is available
great sci-fi movie . imo one of the best of the 50 's . good effects considering the time the movie came out .
seen it on tv and really wanted to add it to my collection not sorry for doing so fun to watch
was equal to the first in terms of its presentation of batman . i particularly liked the way they closed out the movie .
you have to be down with reading subtitles , but this is a really good movie . i love wwii period pieces anyway , and this is a good one .
very good and cute love movie . everyone woman would love to find her true love this way . must see this movie .
how could you not love this . they are some of the funniest movies ever made and are great for family viewing . i am going to share this with my mom . she loves it too !
great movie for both adults & children . definately a movie that i 'd watch again when stuck inside winter time .
i really loved the first movie , and i thought that this one was pretty awesome too .
i watch episodes from time to time late night when i wake up . it 's an enjoyable series and the acting is good
this is a captivating film that does a wonderful job of showing the nature of addiction and drugs . some of the most exciting editing i 've ever seen in a film as well .
this story brings a measure of comfort to families who have lost a son to war ... my collection is better since adding this dvd .
i really purchased this movie for our grandchildren . however , we watched and enjoyed it as well . this was a good family movie all around .
movie was bought as a gift for my son for christmas . i am replacing all his vhs tapes with dvd 's they arrived in good condition an on time . thank you .
got my dvd way ahead of schedule . brand new and not damaged or anything . no problems here . now i will enjoy it and laugh .
not overly great , but good . to see on pbs would have been better rather than buying it . i would only watch it once .
love this dvd ! disney did a great job on this one . the culture and music is classic
i liked this movie because not only was it silly funny but there was an actual story plot . also how can you go wrong with johnny depp .
so so story line . acting was okay but nothing special . good movie if you want to watch something and turn your brain off .
i can watch this type of show over and over again . now i am able to watch them whenever i want .
this was so adorable . just as cute as the first one , if not better . all the characters were adorable . there were just more of them .
i have always liked this movie and especially james dean . it is one of my very favorites from my youth .
these three movies kept me hanging on to every scene . i watched all three in one night . really enjoyable . great plot
get on your dancing shoes and enjoy this old time favorite . my mom loves every minute of it . you will too .
excellent workout . really gets the heart rate up . i love the step routines and the ball routines .
it was a funny movie . i enjoyed . it had the awe factor at the end . good date type movie
this was a very charming movie . although somewhat predictable , ginger rogers delivers a vintage performance along with several great supporting cast members .
i have not watch yet because i just got the movie today but im sure i will enjoy because all the other movie i got i enjoy them
love it ! the dry wit and humor is addicting . i am trying to catch all seasons . wonderful programming for sure !
took my a few shows to get hooked . michael fox was surprisingly entertaining throughout . come on season 4 , become free . i ca n't see paying for these shows as there is so much other content .
this is a great movie all of your favorite characters are back in this third installment of the series . this movie rocks
arrived on time . nice to share my favorite childhood movies with my kids .
the storylines were good and the acting was amazing . the two main characters were very likable and i found myself rooting for them .
dvd was in new condition , arrived promptly , well packed , what can i say ? what 's to complain . i would highly recommend this vendor based on my experience .
i just found it stupid , not well written or funny . i too like one reviewer i saw could n't sit through 30 minutes of it .
i enjoyed this movie a lot . i would recommend this movie to anyone who i know . i think anyone would like it .
sandra bullock performance is sexy and great as usual and the whole movie is very entertaining . i have always enjoyed her movies and performance in them .
when this came out , nothing compared . action , story , great acting and thoughtful . it could have gone anywhere and people paid attention . everyone would probably want to see it at least once .
this was a rare find for me . i love this movie . the best collection of actors in a movie . thank you
this is a light humorous romance movie . it is obviously not meant to be taken seriously . yes , the plot is weak and the script could have been better but it is still an entertaining little film .
nothing to say . this movie is what it is . you like it or you do n't .
this was an enjoyable move for the whole family . my twin daughters really like it and watched it several times with friends .
i thought the movie was visually beautiful and the story line was entertaining . i would recommend the movie for children .
adorable with a powerful message ! we loved this so much that we went to watch it twice at the movies and then bought the dvd . : )
alfred hitchcock is number one and no one will ever top him ! i am so pleased to add this to my large collection of alfred hitchcock ! : )
great action film and entertaining . i love the fact he really cares about her . sweet and romantic from such a tough guy ! !
cant wait to see part 2 and finally the ending of this series ! ! ive been waiting a long time ! ! .
a great dvd . excellent audio and video quality . this is a really good copy of an old tv show . enjoy ! !
good movie thank you it was good i had the first american werewolf and decided to buy this about now
funny adventure story with danny devito at his best . a blast from the past and well worth watching . i highly recommend it .
the acting in this film is excellent as is the cast of actors . the story is well-written and believable . the dynamics between characters as well as the action keeps the film interesting to the end .
excellent film over all , well acted . if you enjoy period films , or are a big jane austen fan you will really enjoy this adaptation .
it is a little dated and overly familiar , but still just as wonderful as you remember it . really worth watching again .
a little slow in the beginning but when it starts to pick up it is very good . great acting by the cast . i do recommend this one .
this film combines the fun and excitement of a hollywood thriller with the accuracy of a documentary . it is memorable , well acted and superbly directed .
i thought that this movie was very well done , and it was very funny . good movie for the whole family . ages 2 and up .
this was a very good movie , the music and dancing was absolutely beautiful . it 's a very beautiful tragic love story . performances are very good and though confusing at times , i enjoyed it .
this has got to be one of the funniest shows out there now , and to own one of the many seasons to come is a relief in the fact that comedy is still here .
i loved all of the episodes and was sad when it was all over ! ! ! i wish there was another season !
this is a great movie ! i had the first one and purchased this one for my collection and really enjoyed it . i hope they come out with another ! recommend this dvd highly ! ! !
it is one of my favorite movies . very well done . it is an excellent cast . would n't change a thing about it .
i love almost everything audrey hepburn starred in . this is no exception . and cary grant and audrey together are great .
i still need to take the time and sit down and watch this . i purchased it just to have more christmas movies and i just have n't found the time to watch yet .
this is one of woody allen 's funniest movies . you will find yourself laughing from the very first scenes to the very last .
awesome movie ! really like the actor from previous movies i seen with him . great purchase , highly recommend checking this movie out !
this has to be one of my top 10 movies of all time . great story and well thought out and acted characters . cant say enough about this movie .
i still wonder how this earned him an oscar . but , after a second viewing , i think i find the movie more interesting . still not sure if it was worthy an oscar .
i love this show , it is so funny and the characters are great . i was so happy to get this as it completed the series for me .
i enjoy the movie you should give this a watch in the future . this movie is worth purchase . come and view this 5 star movie in the future .
thought this was gon na be corny and just a big look at me , look at me movie for the aging action hero 's . but it turned out to be a good movie , i would recommend .
great movie ; i enjoyed all three of the iron man series . great rendition of the comic book hero 's of the past .
great true story . shows what you can do with hard work and lots of caring . shows morals and what you can do if you try .

i was surprised by how good this movie was . i think that it 's an underrated comedy . all the actors were very good .
i kept putting it off , now i 'm super happy to own it . i 've already watched it 4 times since it arrived . & # 60 ; 3
it was terrific but did n't quite live up to the first film . very fun movie but lacked focus at times . in spite of that , i loved the story , the performances and the special effects .
nice movie just like you were at the movie back in the day . good action not a remastered version but still a good picture you will have fun if you like these type of movies .
although a very sad story , this was a really intense , and interesting movie . angelina lives up to her best performances , as usual .
this is one of jeff bridges ' best movies . the story is perfect for him . i enjoyed every moment in this adventure .
great show i remember watching growing up in the 90s ! decent acting and story lines and overall an entertaining show !
we are both very big fans of this show . i was so excited to have found it on here to buy and will definitely buy more ! !
awesome episodes , i would suggest all who like batman to buy this product . best episodes of the series in my opinion .

have not opened the set yet . i expect no problem with the dvd 's , however . that 's all i have to comment on .
this is an amazing movie , i love it because it is one of the few movies you can watch again and again .
i bought seasons one , two , and three of the big bang theory what fun . i have laughed and laughed . if your looking something light and funny you will love these dvd 's . enjoy
enjoying my jerry lewis movies , this one is funny and you will love it . makes you laugh all the way . its a must see movie
another wacky adventure of the summer wine crew . the comedy has changed a little for the new characters but it is still fun and engaging .
great , my grand daughter loved it and i loved these also . keeps your interest and i want to see over and over again .
this was funny in parts but mostly silly and boring to us . would not recommend this to anyone over 16 as teens still find this stuff entertaining !
i have all of the previous movies and was awaiting this one . i love the entire series and it lived up to my expectations .
my mother purchased this series and i like the cosby show but watching it on tv is enough for me . i do not need the videos at home . my parents both really enjoy the series .
highly recommended for those who are into war flicks . good suspense , will watch it for years to come i 'm sure
i really loved this dvd . it has tons of amazing , hard to find , footage but it is for hardcore fans only as it will be boring to those that are not .
it is a very good movie , no nudity , lots of bad words but very good message
if you love 1960 's sci fi movies , get this one , they sets and imagery is excellent , great acting and a great plot !
this is based on actual events that took place in wwii . another great cast and the plot from real life ... ca n't ask for more .
this is a great story about two female friends during a very politically complex era . it was well worth the view .
because it 's fresh and very funny . it shows what a modern family is nowadays . no one is perfect but very real characters with a lot of humor in situations that often times are not humorous !
love the batman animated series . the best and is still the best after all these years from watching it years ago .
been years since i first saw this movie , again it was as funny as the first time i saw it ! !
terrible . the story is awful . i got sick like i was watching blair witch . cant say enough bad things about it .
another gift for my wife . we love the old disney movies - especially sharing them with our sons . no issues .
talk about your classics , this is it ! ! i love every bit of this movie and always hated having to wait to see it one time only . now i can see it whenever i want
i very much enjoyed watching this series and believe i may even rewatch it time and time again . very enjoyable with a little of everything thrown together , humor , love , drama etc .
maybe it was the mixture of antonio banderas with madonna or that the music was bland to me , but i did n't enjoy this movie at all .
i really like this movie . scary movie 1 and 2 are my favorites . its so hilarious .
this was good film . it would have been better if it was in the native tongue and subtitled .
really enjoyed this movie . great acting and great story line . get your popcorn and candy out and enjoy . buy it .
thought it was a documentary . gave it a few minutes . it could n't hold my attention . might try again later ... maybe ... good luck .
it was my family member 's gift for christmas . i gave it a try to watch and loved it so much . i thought it was funny and romantic in the different culture and race ...
movie was recommended by a friend . loved the production and especially the music score . very appropriate to the original story
shaw brothers are the greatest martial arts movie directors of all time ! have n't watched this yet but i 'm sure it will be good !

i give it a seven star . the sell was very good to business and it was good entertainment . i laugh so much it well worth the money .
i like this movie very much like the first carrie but had its own take on it it definitely was a thrilling movie i enjoyed it very much : )

i liked this movie as much as i liked the first and look forward to some more sequels . nuff said .
this movie is great ... typical michael j. fox comedy , definitely worth adding to your collection . great gift for anyone who loves michael j. fox
a movie i wanted and i know we will all enjoy watching this . disney makes great movies for the family .

very interesting with a great cast . action , surprises , felt authentic . worthwhile story . i would recommend this movie to anyone interested in art and wwii .
love this series . every episode is better than the last . leaves you always wondering who is going to turn bad next .
this movie is just plain funny and very entertaining . it would be good to read up on your military history before you look at it , however .

great movie ! a movie i remember seeing in the movie theaters ! i like these actors very much and these types of stories are intriguing to me !
entertaining and well worth the price . who knew the oscar of the muppets could direct such a funny movie . you will laugh at this one
these are some of the best episodes in the whole series , but why buy this when you could by the whole seasons ?
having purchased previous performances by this heavy metal band and being disappointed , i was thrilled with this one -- excellent in every way !
the kids enjoyed the movie ! they are on a roll to watch the series . the video quality was clear and we had no viewing issues .
the cinematography was lovely but the plot fell flat . i did not enjoy the movie at all . i would not waste my time on it if i were you .
it was just ok. was expecting more . might just give it to my neighbor . there is better stuff out there i am sure .
tom hanks is my favorite actor . well done movie , in fact i am watching it right now . i loved the book and the movie holds true to it .

movie was received before promised time . i say this movie is a classic and anyone who loves good movies , this one i highly recommend . excellent movie .
here i got again with another wonderful western told with errol flynn in the lead . will always keep this movie so i can watch it again .
really surprised that i had not heard of this one before finding it on amazon . definitely a pleasant surprise . thought the twists were great and a caught me off guard . watch it .
they could have done a better job with this . the real story has so much to offer . this movie is not worth the time
great christmas cartoon for the whole family to watch . and a great way to introduce the bible to the younger children , and grandchildren .
a great show with some great cinematic bits . i love the way it 's filmed and the plots this season were a lot of fun !
i really enjoyed the premise of this movie . the thought that you need time to live & stop aging at the age of 21 ? is a quite interesting draw .
i myself found this movie to be very interesting and entertaining nothing lie i had expected . was informative and would recommend to others .
glad that amazon has it available for us to see . hope to watch all of the seasons on my ipad
best family sitcom ever . we love watching with our kids and enjoy laughing together . we love the box sets , makes it easier and more enjoyable .
my older kids like this movie but my younger ones had never seen it until easter sunday and now it is one their favorites
a good funny move for the whole family to enjoy ; if you 've watched them all or you just watch this one it 's funny on its own .
bad boys i saw this movie about 3 years ago this was a good movie i 'm 15 this was one of my best movies
i like both of the main characters in this movie . i love thrillers . this one kept my attention the whole movie .
my 6 year old son loves this movie and i found it very fun to watch as well . it is one of our newer favorite movies .
volume 1 was great and exciting to watch . do n't buy volume 2 unless you need something to put you to sleep .
excellent period mystery , not up to agatha christie , but enjoyable . i find that the mystery is n't what draws me to this series but how well done that the historical era is done .
i thought i may have seen this before but i was wrong . good movie . easy to follow . makes me wish i had a place to escape the usual routine of the week .
this show kept me laughing in a very hard week i was having . i you want to laugh this is the show .
i love ginger roger 's acting . she 's delightful . this is an old favorite of mine . so glad it was available through amazon .
actually , my mom bought this movie for my father and so i have no idea what it 's about ... sorry to whoever is reading this but i hope to soon watch it : )
this is a great movie for an afternoon . popcorn , a drink and a relaxing place to seat and that 's all you need .
very entertaining movie . enjoyed seeing how the avengers came together . i recommend this video considering age appropriate , and very entertaining .
i hate that this was cancelled . i admit , it took me a while to get used to the characters , but when you do , you 're set . great show great cast . miss it .
this cartoon is a little off . i feel it is to dark for children . i even cried about seems in the movie .
saw two versions of this but this one was much better story and liked the actors in this one too .
bought all 3 seasons of scooby doo where are you ? awesome quality . a must have for anyone who grew up with the original .
a pleasant movie but nothing special . an ok way to spend a couple of hours . acting was fine but plot dragged .
a good sequel is hard to come by . however , this was better than the first ! you will not be disappointed with your purchase .
this is such a great and funny movie . one of my favorites . i love the actors and the story line
funny movie , great bonus is the twin pack and nice gift and family movie . ca n't go wrong with steve martin . the rest was a filler due to 12 words minimum .
this movie was a great way to start off the series . guy pierce has a good idea of how holmes should act and do .
just finished this one it is really great ca n't wait to start the next series , i know it will be great
i love this movie and i think that it is a good movie for the family including all ages . the whole family loves it .
this is a really good movie about life in the 60 's , fast cars , crazy young lovers , and fun to watch . i highly recommend it .
chris brown rocks the house with his singing and the family in this movie is truely great . the love laughter and tears are throughout this movie and it is a true joy to watch
i encourage every ncis fan to get this ; it 's the best season yet ! ncis is awesome ! buy it today please because you wo n't be disappointed at all !
this is not a show for the easily offended . it is , however , very funny . for everyone whose glory days are behind them .
love love love the actor choices ; otherwise i 'm not sure if the movie would have been as good . as the title states , enough said .
my 10 year loves this movie . funny for both kids and parents . recommended .
i have watched it several times . close enough to get some one thinking to maybe making a decision if they are being moved by the lord
another great christmas movie . just leaves you with that & # 34 ; feel good & # 34 ; feeling . i watch my christmas dvd 's all throughout the year .
after seeing seeing season 1 from the library , i knew i had to get the season series on dvd . the best show on tv .
instant classic . i saw this movie when i was younger in theaters and i still love every minute . jack and sally !
this movie brings back memories , but was not as good as i remember it . it has some very funny parts , some skin , but some lame parts . rent it if you can
not many disc due to short season , but nice set and good price ! ! !
yes not bad at all , i 'll need to consider watching it again to say if i really enjoyed it lol
i really enjoyed this movie despite what critics say . i like almost anything sci fi , except really low budget movies . tom hanks has a way to make you like him .
this is a great show . i truly enjoy it . i enjoy the story line as well as the acting . looking forward to season 3
i like morgan freeman and this shows him as a regular kind of guy and not some big time movie star . watch it and you will like or love it as well .
fringe is awesome and the second season does not disappoint ! it is a highly unique show that you should watch start to finish several times . enjoy !
ellen page is hilarious , well acted , scripted , and directed . overall great movie to have , never tire of watching it . that 's how good this movie is .
amazing film , a great movie to have when you and your girls want to stay in and watch a movie .
my 7 year old loves these dvds . great buy for us , i personally think they could be made better ( have more mario game graphics ) but who am i to say anyway ?
i love this series . it did n't end right to me . needed more seasons . i have watched the whole thing 3 times .
this was an inventive and incredible story that was written by a very creative mind . i loved it from start to finish .
i rented this for someone who was visiting me . i did n't think it was as good as the first one . maybe i should see it again ... i really did n't pay much attention to it .
wonderful storyline about what we as christians should be doing in this life . one young mind won to jesus grows to include many . do n't miss it .
this is a great movie the . the story is great the visuals . a must have for any movie buff who has kids .
dumb , silly , and poorly acted . i was aware of their acting rather than the story line all of the time .
this is a great movie but , as a blu-ray , could have received a better treatment concerning picture quality .
this movie is so wonderful . it 's funny and heartwarming . i 'm so surprised more people do n't know about it . it 's worth renting , you wo n't be disappointed .
i have watched this movie so many times . i never tire of it . samuel jackson does a great job in this movie .
it was a girls night out and we all wanted to go to the movies to see this movie , really liked the movie the ending was ok but would of preferred a different ending .
i loved the movie came in great shape , just what i wanted , great to watch with my husband while sharing some quite time
i ca n't believe they remade this movie . danny kaye is perfect in this role - no one can replace him . if you want to see real talent in action , check out this movie .
really great movie for the whole family to sit down and watch . a great story line with a great and happy ending .
and great price . i love the beach boys and am so happy to hear more magical music from them . brian wilson is my favorite artist .
i did enjoy this movie because it 's based on the bible but it was on fast forward . things happened so fast and the story just passed you by .
i thought this would be another film from this series . .. however it was so good and suspenseful it kept all of us on our toes
another great movie and this awesome too . if you like patrick in any of his movies you 'll love this one .
this movie is a classic , a must own , it puts ford in the top ten actors , of all time .
a wonderful true story about a young girl who had the courage to want to better her life . life is like a book - one page at a time .
so short , so sweet , so well executed for the 1950 's ... beautiful , amazing , insightful , simple ... well see for yourself is all i can say .
i really like the movie and so does my husband ... the chemistry between denzel & mark is great ... and their humor is too ...
i think this movie is great ! ! ! this movie has great action , and great visual effects ! ! ! this movie did indeed arrive on time ! ! !
i wish i had discovered this show when it was on the air it 's so well done . great story fantastic cast i look forward to watching this on amazon !
loved this movie ! my husband and i went to see it when it came to the theater in the 80 's . it has a good plot and ending .
crystal clear and brilliant colors . just what i hoped to get . a wonderful piece of work .
if you are familiar with the other underlying movies this film is a riot . i enjoyed the movie very much and will probably watch it several more times to catch everything i did not the first time around .
ok , it is animated , but the animation is great and there is a good story line . it is a good sci-fi movie and certainly worth watching a few times .
i usually love these two actors and the story lines they choose . this story was not what i expected . i will still watch these actors in the future .
i saw this movie ; years ago and i was happy amazon has it.i bought it on the instant video for my kindle . a really good movie i love the ocean
one of the best sitcoms ever ! great writing and acting . second only to i love lucy in my book . a classic !
i had seen this prior to purchase , enjoyed it enough to add to my collection , a good light hearted comedy .
i am an army wife . this movie was heartwarming and sweet . i loved that it included god and god 's plan for her life . a wonderful movie !
was very different . kind of dark tale , but also thrilling . had to know what was going to happen next . is there going to be another season ?
a clean show the whole family can watch . and the actors do a marvelous job ! the storylines are always good .
great show . if you like being on the edge of your seat , you will love this show . i recommend it . keeps you wanting more .
i completed the series of home improvement , this year , for christmas , for my son . he loves them , and watched them immediately .
this movie was n't all that entertaining , nor did i think the directing was very good . i recommend you pass on this one .
the bear is funny . but most of the funny stuff was in the commercials . not sure why it 's received so much hype as being one of the funniest movies ever - not even close .
i loved the show when it was on television and love being able to watch it whenever i want now .
this whole series is just wonderful ! this gift made a big hit for my grandson 's first birthday . i will look for other titles in the series .
if you want a cute love story , here it is ! you will want to watch it over again ! grab the popcorn and enjoy !
read by all , watched by many , you ca n't go wrong having this in your library . nothing else needs to be said , a classic ! !
move along , this movie did not keep me interested . it was strange for lack of better words . i do n't recommended this movie .
looking back at it from 2013 its pretty dated in approach . not something to look at as a classic , but as a time filler .
audrey is stunning in this story of a young girl who wants to work with the sick . i could easily re-watch it .
did not watch it all these years on tv . it is one of my favorite now . ca n't wait to watch the next one , so sometimes i watch them back to back to back
i guess i 'd heard so much about the movie before seeing it , that it did not live up to the hype . still a movie worth seeing !
very good movie . actually an excellent movie . true story and very well done . i would recommend this movie highly to anyone
super excited to be able to own the entire show . even my kids love it and its at a very affordable price too : )
this play was hilarious ! also very touching with lots of good life lessons . must see !
we really did enjoy this movie and would recommend it for the whole family . you can watch this movie and not wonder what is going to pop out . well worth getting !
this is one of my mom 's favorite movies and she was very happy to receive it . well acted along with a good story line !
this was a great tv show . i just hope all the seasons come out . i loved watching nick back in the 90 's , and more of those shows need to be on dvd .
there is n't much i can add to this wonderful movie . the bd update is crisp and clear as well as audio .
plenty of action , drama and even comedy mixed into one great movie . the acting was superb and no wonder it was given awards .
out of all the hulk movies i think my son likes this one the best and so do i thanks
i liked the movie and saw it several times over the years so i decided to add it to my dvd library .
love this season . this series was even better than i remembered . i think it is better than season one and would recommend it .
when this show was on tv i make a point to watch it all the time . this was great that now i can watch it anytime is great , but hope that i can find other seasons .
i love the riddick movies . non-stop action . you also get to see riddick evolve from the first movie pitch black .
great buy ! lots of action and suspense ! never a dull moment ! either bought for self or for another person , it is a series to be enjoyed !
this is great a collection of some off his great movies and this is andy hardy at his best all ways in and out of trouble
this movie should get six stars but you can only go as high as five . i love this movie due to its action style with a decent story .
have become an avid lover of this book series , have read the books and feel so far this is the best motion picture representation so far looking forward to the last two .
this movie is a total new movie from the original judd dredd . i really like this movie and should give it a honest viewing . in my option , it three times better than the original .
we love pirate movies and have a large collection this adds a new set of films that we enjoyed together
got this for my sister is fan of his movies and she ask me to get it for her and i did
i am only about half way through the season and find it to be compelling . i would recommend the series to a friend !

i am done and bored . do n't like vampires . i used to like them cause of the romance but i have moved on .
still well done by this fabulous duo . its in color , but i prefer black & white . still worth the purchase price .
this dvd arrived early & in great condition as it was ordered new as i had seen this dvd several times before & i still enjoy this movie !
i certainly hope you will die soon and & # 34 ; does anyone win one of these ? & # 34 ; a wonderful cast and ensemble . holds up very well .
item shipped timely . item as described . great movie , one of the classics i would recommend to anyone . watched several times already
anything with jason statham is going to be action packed . this is a little less than his other films but you wo n't fall asleep either . more suspense and nice ending . definitely entertaining .
it is not a recent production but it is outstanding in all aspects ; singers , orchestra , production , this is the best there is , enjoy

hilarious show with quick wit and fun characters - fast paced and entertaining : ) my favorite is jeremy 's interview ! fun
loved this purchase . bought it for a gift , it was a great price , not to mention it has a lot of my favorite christmas movies !
love season four as much as the first three seasons . we laughed through every episode . did n't want the dvd to end . if you want to laugh , get the dvd .
good but not great , but then one should not expect excellence from a film such as this . mainly for horror film collectors .
this was a great ending to a good series which started out as ( for me ) an animated series . too bad i had to give them to my son .
this is another movie that we do not remember being in the theaters , but we really enjoyed it . it had a great cast of characters .
did not want to walk away from the tv while watching this one . nicholas cage does a great job in this one .
the movie was as expected and has been viewed with my family plenty of times . extra features were great to watch .
this one is much better than the rated . i rented this twice , first unrated then by accident the rated . this one is much better .
great great great great great movie of all times besides king kong ! i collect all the classics its worth it
i have been a fan of the show for years . this is a must have for any fan of dark shadows , or a great movie to get you interested in the series .

its a decent movie and watched it because i love anything with bruce willis in it . action type futuristic movie .

one of my favorite movies . about the best sort of story you could wish to get to know .
this is a very enjoyable movie about a father who goes on a college road trip with his daughter and he learns to let go eventually . it is very entertaining .
a classic movie with 2 classic actors and 2 classic actresses , they may have gotten older , but they are still able to make a great movie , some people only get better with age . : )
very funny movie story line was good teaches you how not to question your relationship when you have someone special be thankful
i have n't seen a movie that tyler perry made that i did n't like . the actors were wonderful , and the music beautiful .
odd humor you do not expect to see in a movie which gave me a laugh and some enjoyment to watch it
loved watching this show on syfy years ago so now i 'll be watching a marathon of it commercial free anytime . a great price and fast ship as usual . thanks
just got it . have only watched a few of the episodes . looks great and sounds great .
i liked the first season and not sure what happened but this season just seemed super corny , so i quit watching it .
still love randolph scott one of the old time favorite actors ~ yep need more like him in today 's movies
i love this series and i never really cared for zombie movies . i got the download so i could watch it on my ipad . ca n't wait for season 3 !
well acted , a good view , slightly unbelievable but two quality actors carry it of and the effects are excellent and well done
this movie is too long . i did n't like it . did n't find it that interesting .
my kids loved this movie ! the only complaint they had is that they felt it was n't long enough . worth watching !
lots of well known film stars putting in time for mad money . this is a better pick than watching standard television fare .
this is an excellent series and am so glad that i found it on line and reasonable and discs in good condition . thank you
i love this movie . ww2 , brad pitt , guns , & making history into something a little more satisfying . i recommend this movie .
wonderful movie , a real classic , laugh and cry at the same time . everyone should see this and not just once , over and over .
i throughly enjoyed this movie of hitchcock making psycho . it was entertaining and kept my attention throughout the movie . i would watch again .
i like sifi , and this had a clever premise , but just ended up being weird . it had potential , but did n't seem to actually go anywhere and left you hanging at the end .
harry potter has learned a lot over the years and it just keeps going . all these movies keep your attention .
this is just too cute for words . we have all the muppet movies and love all of them . but this is my absolute favorite . highly recommend .
these were really great western movies to watch . we loved each of them and we will watch them again . they do not have the violence that a great many movies have today .
i loved seasons one and two and this one was no different . phil is one of my favorite television characters so i always enjoy the episodes where he plays a big part .
this was purchased as a gift and was very much appreciated . it was something desired and he was very happy to get . it was just as advertised and shipped as stated .
i saw some previews of this show and bought it out of curiosity . it is a great action series with great actors . will leave you wanting more
i love this movie . it 's cute and blue and i love the nyc scenery ... . : ) . it 's a good hd purchase too since its a new movie and details are plenty .
every average and hardcore horror fan should have this in their movie collection . not as scary as most people say , but lots of gore and entertainment with a very original story .
my husband and i both enjoyed this movie ! ! the dvd was in great condition ! ! this is a great addition to our collection !
beautiful sets , a sweet story and casting is perfect . i wish this was still on the air . i miss it .

another great action film in the mission impossible series . a must have for an action movie or cruise fan . good buy
two of the greatest movies from the 1950 's , both are great stories and great visual effects for their day yeah
my daughter & i love this movie and the people in this movie make this movie one of the best ! !
history movies are my favourite . this is a good movie , i really enjoy it ! cate blanchett 's acting is amazing as always . great cast , picture and costumes ! ! !
this is a true classic with don knotts . i have been looking for those classics from growing up to add to my collection . found this and could not resist .
i loved the series when it was on television and am enjoying it just as much as when i saw it the first time . free tv series episodes just adds a wonderful bonus to my amazon prime membership !
two good actors give a very good performance that is very funny and enjoyable to watch . the cast also includes many other very good actors that combine to make a very good movie !
one of my all time favorites . good acting , lots of action and even a chick could watch it ( is that wrong ? ? ) !

my daughter has always love these movies even as a child . she was glad that i found this it was a great buy .
love to watch . funny movie to enjoy while doing what the title states . dont expect oscar material - just a lot of laughs
this is a must have for the any fan of the series . it 's very entertaining and full of action packed episodes . i highly recommend it for any age !
heart still has it and both sisters could still sing in 2001 ( when made ) if your a heart fan get it
this movie is almost exactly the same as the first with some subtle differences it is funny though
the quality of the hd was good , the movie was ok , kinda funny my 5 year old niece had no interest so i guess now we do n't need to buy it : )
i have watched this plenty of times but love it . i love watching christian and inspirational movies and am stocking up on them . this is a must see for a family whether you know god or not .
i sent it to my 4 year old granddaughter and she wants to watch it everyday ! ! wow ! ! my daughter has really enjoyed it all over again ! !
it 's great to be able to get videos of old shows i grew up with . with so little to watch on tv now nice to be able to have these available .
i liked this movie , although its somewhat not your average romance film . it 's set in an atmosphere that is somewhat depressing , however , there is a good story line .
this is an all time classic movie . peter sellers should have gotten an oscar for his work in this highly creative and original film
this is one of our favorite movies . love it . thanks for making it available for us to purchase at this time .
this a great part of the old series and i really like it , some series are better with the old version and not the new ... .
my five year old seemed to watch it for 30 minutes and then did not care to finish it . i only lasted 10 minutes .
this movie is about a young woman trying to find her way to the right path . she finds out that all you have to do is listen your heart
it 's fine . charlize theron did a great job , and she definitely carried the movie in my opinion . i am not sure if i will watch the sequel .
i really enjoyed this show . i had never seen it so i took a chance because of the great actors . i was not disappointed !
this is a really good movie and i would highly recommend it to anyone who loves this genre . too funny and great plot .
the ending was awesome . little awkward using a child but it was good . some parts dragged on but over all i thought it was a great movie ! ! ! ! !
this in my opinion is one of the best films on jesus christ that was ever made . it is moving and the film i have seen .
these are all fairly light hearted superhero cartoons . sure they look like they were made in the 60 's , but their is a timeless quality about them . yes , it 's a good thing .
this really is a fun film , costuming is brilliant and the performances are delightful ! great twist at the end of the film !
i never get tired of watching this movie -- and the soundtrack literally rocks ! wahlberg , as always , is incredible in this movie .
one of the best movies ever made . i do n't care about special features so i could n't tell you about those . just needed a new copy .
this movie was such a beautiful story . watch it all the time & love it . pixar always makes wonderful movies & this is one of my favorites .
it is a fun movie to watch . makes you think of your own high school days . love melissa joan hart !
my daughter likes this movie a lot . it is sort of a sad movie but does have a good moral theme .
this is a wholesome , enjoyable movie to watch . i could watch this movie over and over , and as a matter of fact , i will .
i loved brad pitt and edward norton is a freak ! this movie is definitely a mind trip . you have to see it to believe it .
i 'm sure i 'm going to like it , i just have n't had a chance to watch it . i like the musical on tv and that 's why i bought my own cd .
this movie was ok. it was not anything too special . it was worth the watch , but not one i would want to watch over and over .
this movie , although this version is the original is filled excitement and humor , very relaxing to look at , highly recommended .
i saw this recently on pbs and really enjoyed it . i did not have high expectations but it was well done and kept my interest . i hope there will be more of these .
it was just really nice to see a well developed plot , great acting and a story that kept my interest throughout .
just love the lord of the rings . however left hanging until the next hobbit movie .
i had n't seen these in so long - it was great to re-watch them all at once . blu-ray is such great quality and got them super fast in the mail .
i happen to like the actors and tommy lee jones was great as the typical older man . not meryl streep 's finest performance . not a riveting movie but cute and kind of funny in spots .
it was too slow , and boring . i lost interest and started playing games on the computer . but you might like it .
i really like the plot and the characters of the movie . lots of good action and some character development . worth the cost of the rental in my opinion
the special effects are phenomenal . brought together the first series very well . liked this one better then the first movie
this movie is so humorous , we love it ! it is fun and clean for the whole family , definitely one of our favorites .
this was a present for a family member . i know that columbo was very big in its day . i am sure they will enjoy it . thank you .
great gift . my sister loves this movie with burt , says it is one of her favorites .
if you are a star trek buff this is must own along with the rest of the movies to this series .
we must have watched this movie 10 times . i love the twists of events at the end ! ! ! this is definitely a movie to see if you have not seen it already .
so good - when it 's over i wish there were more ! you ca n't help but get addicted to true blood !
if you love fantasy movies , you have to watch this , but be prepared for some bad acting ... the plot is great and so are the sets .
its a great beginning to a great show . i also bought spencer 's mountain . if you enjoyed & # 34 ; the waltons & # 34 ; , you need to see both of these
the first season is great and its wonderful to see each episode uncut instead of seeing them on tv cut for commercials . waiting for season 2 .
excellent product discs had no problems and played perfectly love this show and cant wait to order more hope they got more
i wish i could get more seasons . i love dr. g and wish i could do her job ! she is awesome !
if you like vampires and werewolf you will love this movie . love the whole series . plan on buying the rest of them .
i think the world of clint eastwood but i don ` t care to much of his move
i enjoy everything about the american indian . it is so sad but something i believe everyone should be aware of !
this movie is a must see for all dog lovers . the relationship between man and dog is so heart warming !
i liked it , pretty decent but not as good as some of the more & # 34 ; cult classic & # 34 ; zombie flicks like dawn of the dead , etc .
this movie was different and was very interesting from start to finish . think i 'll watch it again real real soon .
what can you say about roseanne . either you love her or you hate her ! ! ! the dvd was great . very pleased with transaction and delivery time .
i have n't seen all of the bond movies , but most of them , including the early ones . this is the best one in my opinion .
i thought it could have had the same outcome in 20 minutes as it did in almost two hours just okay in my book .
kind of a turning of age movie . it was entertaining but had bad language . not something everyone would want to see
it was well acted and well written . i took away one star because the main character did n't survive . that sucked , but the rest was really good .
what can i say when you have robert downey jr as the star of a movie ! love this move and have watched it many times !
great movie for the whole family . kids love the `` snow man '' and the story is heartwarming
it 's loud , sure , but i really liked this one the best , having seen every one of the entire collection as they were released .
i love the fact that i wake up and my episode is ready for download . we are on the go and do n't have dvr so the ipad works great and is always with me .
just watch it dont pay attention to all the reviews its a good movie fast paced good music and interesting .
wasnt sure what to expect , but the movie turned out to be a great addition to our war movie collection
it was like & # 34 ; aliens & # 34 ; at first before they got on this ship ! if you think about it , i am right !
this drama has not gotten as much attention as other british productions , but i think it is one of the best . everything you expect : beautiful costumes and locations , great actors , intriguing story .
i believe this version is the original . for me , no other version ( and there have been many ) comes close to this version .
liked the story and the ending , it was a bit slow for me and a soap opera flavor , which is not my thing and why i gave it four stars .
possibly the best movie to watch on an ipad while sitting in a plane ever made . is die hard with giant robots .
not a bad start but i feel short of liking this movie . almost like a copy of some other movie .
not what i expected , very well done . it is a must see , expected a romance and got a family drama and war flick all in one .
if you are into this kind of movie you will love it ! it really gets to the heart of what these people went through . i would highly recommend this one .
what is not to like about burn notice ? it has been around all of this time for a good reason .
i was satisfied with the product and the time it took to get to me . : )
these are classic comedies and i bought the blu-ray versions to add to my collection . walter matthau and jack lemmon were greats .
it adds and follows the movies extremely well . the acting is superb and i will hate to see it end !
i remember seeing this some time ago and i thought this was a crazy movie but it had a great plot and a even greater twist ! !
if you love british productions or if you love history or if you just love watching a family drama without having to watch sex and violence , you 'll love downton abbey
great movie and action keeps you on the edge of your seat on what will happen next in this movie
it was far to much like a sad and sappy soap opera . i just could not get into the show .
ordered this to add to private collection after enjoying it so much on tv . wonderful story lines and extremely entertaining .
this is one of my favorites when it comes to clint eastwood and westerns in general . love it and watch it at least once a year or so .
this is a great movie to entertain the younger crowd as well as the generation that grew up in the 90 's and watched these movies , a good purchase !
i would watch this show over in reruns and always miss the ending ... now i own all the seasons and can watch them whenever i want ...
this is what was expected of this kind of movie . i hate to use the word typical .
i do n't like cruise but this movie was just good . suspenseful and action packed .
this movie holds up really well for as old as it is . it is always it is fun to watch old scifi movies set in the future .
good flick not a bad movie at all . depp kills it like always , he takes the character and makes it his .
i really love this movie , so very good i ca n't believe that i have never seen it on tv . it had some very good effects for when it was made .
i really love the midsomer murders series and am looking forward to being able to collect the entire series . can hardly wait !
blu-ray is the way to go ! ! ! ! i love ed norton and colin farrell and they did n't disappoint ! ! ! ! ! ! thank you ! ! ! ! !
good movie but already knew that before i watched it . i had seen it years ago but , forgot the plot so watched it again .
i did n't have high hopes for it , but i actually really liked it . certainly had my full attention . i recommend it ! !
this was a very interesting side story . it was mild compared to other marvel animated movies . not over the top , but still a great movie .
i love veggie tale movies . this is one i was replacing from my purchased copy in vhs format . it 's god 's word made simple ! thank you big idea !
classic comedy . great writers . will keep you laughing from beginning to end . characters are well developed . story lines for episodes are humorous and interesting .
exceptionally entertaining and heart-warming . . .the casting is excellent , the plot is good , and there is a delightful musical theme . hilarious at times .
get all of the movies in 3d ! i do n't usually watch bonus discs , so the fact they are n't in here does n't matter to me . i am such a fan of these movies !
i bought this for my sister and her family who just moved to canada . i forgot how much this movie sucked .
i enjoyed these movies and they were great to watch after a long day of work . i am not the greatest fan of charlie sheen , but these are good to watch .
gary cooper and grace kelly and a tense drama . what 's more to like ? this is a just plain excellent movie ! ! !
i have never even seen the whole blade trilogy and watched it and loved it and wesley snipes really played the part extremely well .
one of the classics ! ! ! seen it more than once ... love to watch it when its cold out ... .great actors ... great story line ... .
a fun movie for an evening in . doris day and rod taylor are good together .
our family enjoyed this movie . a new twist on an old story with lots of laughs !
i saw this on the big screen when it was released over 20 years ago . it 's just a funny , easy movie to view .
i love watching the mission impossible trilogy series and the old tv show . theres nothing like watching something you grew up with .
i bought this for my brother and he loved it . thanks so much for having it.. great gift for the family .
my mom was sooooo excited to get this movie . so was i cause that just means she has it and does n't have to watch at my house anymore !
great series , fun to watch , nothing too serious , enjoyed watching the entire series but you can tell it was getting worn out by the 5th season ...
these brought back memories of when i first started watching the show . i always loved getting to know these characters .
i did not find the story line believable . it was supposed to be a comedy , but it did not make me laugh . i did not enjoy it at all .
loved the anime but the case was cracked other than the case being cracked overall good anime i loved it
very good movie . it is intense with some very extreme fighting scenes . it also does a great job showing the human side of war on both sides .
i enjoyed this movie with action and no profanity or nudity . i wish hollywood would understand that we do not need blood , guts , profanity or nudity to be entertained and wholesome family movies do sell .
my husband and i are murdoch fans and could n't wait to get this . got it almost immediately in the mail .
one of my all time favorite movies . i wish it would go on forever . good product and good service . thanks
the movie is so cute and a lot of people can relate . i would highly recommend the purchase .
i really liked the comics when they were on the stands . the movie stays true to the original story . you have have a little trouble with the plot if you don 'd know the story .
this movie was very different from any movie i have ever seen i hope they come out with sequel to this movie .
same humor , wonderful characters and a great storyline . loved that we found out how the team came about . worth watching just for the special effects .
i have these dvds because they are safe for my young grandsons to watch . newer cartoons are not nearly as good .
when i first saw this movie , i was pleasantly surprised . i found this to be a great movie for old and young alike .
i really enjoyed this movie ... it kept me riveted from the opening scene on . really intense with a great ending !
too funny ! great romantic comedy , fun to watch on date night ! ! i have seen several times , and always get a laugh ! !
good parts to the movie , funny here and there but way too long . some parts of the movie was ridiculous and i think unnecessary .
i love clark gable and this movie is very good . i bought this for my mom and she watches it all the time . great buy .
i really enjoyed this movie , it was a different type of movie , and the features in the menu were great to watch also . i 'm glad to include this movie in my video library .
well done movie . not exactly what i expected . showed a side of marilyn i believe few people knew . the actors were great
it 's one of those movies you can watch over and over . jodie foster at her best . highly recommend this movie .
really a fine movie and story . a real lost gem that is enjoyable to watch time and time again . burt lancaster gives a terrific performance .
total waste of time and money . movie was boring and really not worth the time or effort to even order
what is not to like ? it 's entertaining , it 's really good , the story lines are fresh and it has simon baker in it ! that 's a win , win !
great movie , the picture and color quality is excellent in blu-ray . the dvd is just as great as it was in the movies .
an old fashioned series that i used to watch on tv as a child . it brought back some pleasant memories . well done .
horrible , boring nonsense ! nothing more to say - just wasted 2 hours ( actually i fell asleep , so it was n't a complete waste ) . do n't waste money or time on this stinker !
this was good i loved the woman of substance much better , but hold the dream was good , the story continues !
one of my favorite john wayne movies . great price and lots of entertainment here . love any movie with john wayne .
i loved the series and loved this movie particularly . this is one book that you need to read the books first since much of the action reflects the mental nature of the hunger game .
i never have seen a more funny movie than this one . it has always been one of my favorites . i am so glad i was able to purchase it from you all .
it 's a movie to watch on a day when you have nothing else to do , because it was very predictable .
this movie is great , the cast have a great chemistry together ! owen wilson , vince vaughn , bradley cooper and christopher walken together make for one very funny combination .
good acting , direction , plot , and storyline . i have seen this move more than once in the past and enjoyed watching it again .
you ca n't go wrong with lewis black , his stand up is laugh out loud funny ! [ ... ]
this was a christmas present for my daughter , she loves this movie so much . now she wants the new one
i have always loved both of these movies . i can still remember going to the movies to see them on the big screen . the sound and digital quality are great !
i got this for somebody who has been looking for it , they enjoyed it , it was in good condition and for a good price , thank you .
just as good , if not better than the first movie . i ca n't tell why without giving away the plot , but it will definately surprise you .
the delivery was in perfect time ! i love the first and the second part of this trilogy and this part is just fantastic ! the special effects on this movie are so awesome ! !
a good cast of characters in a surprisingly engaging thriller . lots of twists and turns , so it requires your full attention . i liked it .
we love watching these movies at home . they never get old and i ca n't wait to watch them over and over again .
i watch one of the episodes every night before i go to bed . there 's nothing like a good laugh to end your day !
i had vhs tape before . i watched in dvd . it was excellent movie as i remember .
this movie is a complete disaster . it fails in every way . save your time and money do n't purchase this film .
it desire five star and love it can not wait to see next season and it worth buying it rule
one of those films you will watch time and time again ( if you like the cast of course ) you will love this !
i was very happy with this video . i was pleased with the service i received .
i saw this on tv and my heart just broke . very emotional but very good . i would recommend this to everyone . very prompt delivery .
wow , really disappointed in the picture quality of the blu ray . really grainy . great show , but not worth the price of a blu ray . buy the dvd .
very low grade movie . i ca n't believe they think anyone would enjoy this at all . do n't waste your valuable time .
one my most favorite movies of the 1980 's i highly recomend watching this : ) this is also a good family movie too
good follow-up to & # 34 ; the mummy ' & # 34 ; if you like funny and scary adventure .
this service is fast and simple no complaints no problems only joy and happiness . i would recommend this service to all and everyone .
interesting this guy is not in more movies . i liked this guy just as much as randolph scott . this movie is very good for an older movie .
i have a number of gay male friends and this gave me a good insight into their life style and life .
replaced our vhs copy and this is one of my favorites to watch , all the actors did well in their roles . good movie !
i know this movie did not do well , but i love it ! it was sexy and the , the soundtrack was good .
this is a great movie funny sad and cool this is a must bye movie
was taken back into time ! totally enjoyable and thrilled to add this one to my classic library of dvd 's !
i liked it fairly well and suggested it to some friends to watch . there are a few things you can learn from watching the movie .
very good movie that kept you in suspense the whole time . i would recommend this thriller with its twist and turns .
nothing about this movie is great . not sure why , just did n't feel anything . the acting is pretty blah , the story line is blah . do n't bother
really lame movie , hard to sit through because of the poor filming and acting . was this movie made for 100 bucks ? it sure looks like it .
lots of action from start to finish . it keeps you on the edge of your seat during the whole movie , like i said great !
another jerry classic fun movie . you just have to sit back and relax to enjoy it and you get guaranteed laughs !
my wife and i love this show . this makes a great gift idea for any lover of big bang . price is fantastic for a full season as well
it 's incredible . from start to finish , it 's not boring , it does n't drag on , and it shows a completely different style of cinema that 's incredible to watch .
since paul is now gone i am glad i own this movie.. it was the last movie he was in before his accident
i really enjoyed this movie . done very well . james garner plays his perfect role . i think you will enjoy it .
awesome movie ! awesome acting ! great story ... .a classic greek tragedy set in france with a wonderful moral point . if you do n't mind subtitles , this is a keeper .
i remember seeing this movie at the theater , yes , the effects are not today 's effects , but i still love the story , and the actors . it is a classic to me .
if you 've seen the trailer , you 've seen everything to see in this movie . do n't rent it . just watch the trailer over and over again for free .
i really like this movie and have watched it several times . i would buy it again and it does have several classic moments .
these are great chick flicks that are warming and entertaining , also i received them within a week and a half .
this is an old movie i have watched several times in the past and do not seem to get tired of watching . ..
this movie view was not satisfied and the movie script was bad . unfortunately this movie was not favorite to movie fans .
i kept getting lost and confused . a very slow moving , sometimes boring , movie . i just did n't like the plot for the most part .
did n't know what i expected , but this was something different . the story was good , price and delivery great . will watch it again .
this product was excellent . i had a hard time trying to find this vintage cartoon . i ordered it as a birthday gift and it arrived as also , it arrived on schedule .
totally a guilty pleasure . excellent cast and writing , which created a believable family , even when over the top . yeah , i love it still .
i found this show to be outstanding . much better then the masters of horror series . wonder why its not on blu-ray since it was on hd tv . great price too !
wonderful movie ! tim allen was great ! we love christmas movies especially the funny ones . this fits my favorite category perfectly !
i now have the complete season one and two these are great tv shows i got life after people on amazon this is a must for any fan .
the movie was a disappointment but perhaps i should have read more about it before watching . usually , i love julia roberts ' movies but this one was unlike any that i 'd seen her in before .
this movie had a lot of action and special effects . for me the plot was a little thin . if you like the video game this movie is for you .
this was bought as a gift for my husband but i really enjoyed watching it . need to make more !
this movie takes one to a magical place of wonder . its characters are unique and wholesome and gives a sense of a place in time where little creatures come to life .
movie was very good . son and daughter are very big into the hobbit and it did n't disappoint . would watch again
i got them for my grandchildren and they all enjoyed the movie so it was a success . my wife even enjoys watching barbie
this is one of my all time favorite shows . i will buy all seasons over time . very funny yet intelligent .
just loved the movie was glad to add to my collection of dragon dynasty films . they are the greatest martial art films and they only keep getting better
some of the plots and twists are amazing . how they come up with some of the most unusual clues , and piece them together . they are a great pair .
received as advertised . very quick delivery . highly recommend . been looking for this for awhile .
this is a film about humanity and honesty . a very good film indeed .
we love this movie . scary in parts would n't recommend to young ones , but clean scary movie . we very much enjoy it .
when i saw that i could order the entire season at a reasonable price , i went for it ! i love the actors , the writers , the everything ! everyone works so well together as a team !
this is a fun movie with some fantastic music - actually , i think the music is my favorite . the dragons are awesome and it 's a fun movie .
one of the best children stories of the year . i can see my son watching this many times over the years .
the movie had so many unexpected scenes and ending that it keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time .
i bought the dvd because everybody has told me the movie is very good . i have not seen it ( yet ) and i hope to be able to watch it pretty soon .
this movie is a great movie about werewolves . its a low budget fill , you can tell but its very well done . a bit on the gory side but still entertaining to watch
this is one of those movies that will stay on my shelf forever . i loved the story and the characters . i definite classic !
great for the family . great dvd . they do n't make dvds like this anymore . great oldie . lets see what comes next .
i bought this for my nephew and he loves it . the shipping was fast and it arrived in excellent condition .
watched it with the family and everyone thought it was pretty funny , we will watch it again later this year
this is a good flick , at anytime not just during the christmas season , shows jessica can actually act not just be fluff . i enjoyed it . i 'd rate it a five star movie .
there is no other movie that can touch the outstanding cast that is featured in this film . excellent in comedy ! !
i bought all three seasons for my husband as a gift since he enjoyed this series very much and it is no longer on .
i ca n't wait for season 5 to come out ! i 'm in love with the characters . this is a must see series !
was ok , good movies to watch at least once , if you a brad pitt fan that helps , good effects and the story was good .
the movie is good , but no matter what kristen stewart no matter how pretty she is , is no actress . outside of that , i love the whole twilight saga
jamie foxx and all the stars are awesome in this movie . i love this movie all the actors are great in it . the quality of the dvd was great and i will buy again from this seller .
though this only part of the series it got wanting to get the whole series . i would recommend getting if you are a anime lover .
great purchase . this movie is so funny . i love jennifer aniston in it . plus , as someone who loves fashion , i really loved jennifer aniston 's fashion in this . very entertaining .
boris ! great actor ! great man ! the original `` mummy '' films were scary and fun ! boris is brilliant !
truly enjoyed this movie . held your interest from beginning to end and the story was amazing . i guess we always like to root for the underdog . fun movie to watch ! ! !
good family classic . has a little bit of something for everyone . has some good life lessons in it . my daughter loves this movie !

great blu-ray trilogy to own if you love the riddick films . b-movie fun done right in my opinion . must buy !

this is truly one of my favorite movies , ever ! my grandson loved it so much i had to give it to him ! such a powerful message for everyone !
this is one of the best movies that i have . i watch it all the time . they should all be this realistic .
i have to admit blu ray does make a difference ! a classic sci-fi movie and one of the best sequels ever . well worth it !
i liked this series better when it was called , columbo , and starred peter falk .
for all the previous reviewers who gave this film a 4 or 5 star , this review is just to say that i am with you .
it kept me up late at night and late for work in the morning ! i could n't shut it off ! great !
i have n't seen this since i was a child . loved watching it again . glad older movies are available to watch .
this movie is a classic . i just love john wayne . he is one of my all time favorite actors . the movie played great also .
thought this was the life of pi . could not watch more than 15 minutes . thought it was depressing and sad not what you want to watch on a weekend evening .
i kept waiting for the movie to make some kind of sense . i 'm guessing it just was n't my kind of movie . the previews got my attention , the movie dropped it .
a fun movie with a great story line . bought it for the 3d and was very happy with how it looked on the tv .
this this one of the top hitchcock shows made , love the suspense but the ending could have been better , what a classic .
this was just plain fun . gene kelly really played a fun part and you know he 's having a ball . this is my favorite version of this movie .
worth watching ! the series is a complete story , so this is one aspect of the journey !
it was a very excellent product , i like this movie , to everyone who likes this kind of movie , very good product .
there was only one quick shot of skin , the rest could be fast forward through . i gave the movie away .
the plot of the movie is really good it keeps you glued to the screen .
it is just as good the 5th time as it was the 1st . i love movies that are well scripted and entertaining .
the people were average looking and so was the scenery -- so no escape from realism . kids liked it . too slow and boring for me .
awesome about the military school . it is sad you will cry but it is worth crying for . please buy this amazing story .
this right now because it is a very amazing and if you do enjoy hopefully you will love them cartoon
the cast , the plot and the soundtrack are all great ! ! ! i can watch over and over again
this movie starts off very slow , but i really enjoyed the movie . i do wish it had a better ending that 's why i only gave it 4 stars . i would watch it again .
this is one of the greatest movies ever made and i think everyone should watch it . it has terrific lessons that we all should learn .
has been so long since i 've seen this , i could n't remember it . what a lovely lovely movie . hits the right note all through .
the 2nd one just lacked interest in what the characters had to do in the movie . i was hoping for more and i got the typical sequel movie .
nicely done period piece . i have n't watched all the episodes yet . i do love watching these historically accurate ( looking ) shows .
whats not to love about this movie ! this is my all time favorite movie and its on blue ray ! this makes me very happy ! ! !
this is one of the funniest movies i have seen in a long time . would recommend to any friends or family members .
love this tv show , so sad that it was canceled after only 3 seasons , i would have watched it for at least 2 more !
maggie smith is such an outstanding actress , both past and present . i would suggest to anyone who enjoys quality acting to her films .
i bought this for my mom . she says it is kind of just a repeat of the other cutting edge videos but being & # 34 ; part two & # 34 ; it is n't that bad .
this was a very light and funny movie . i enjoyed it and even bought part 2. i enjoyed it from begining to end . welcome to the bear community .
clearly worth the academy awards it received . one of the greatest movies of human struggle ever made . a must buy .
this movie was weak . the actors were too fake . do n't waste your money .
if you 're a fan of the 50 's sci-fi genre , these are four of the best .
this movie is great 80s cheese . the movie has great atmosphere and the music fits perfectly . but why is there no widescreen ? ? this movie has been edited to fit your tv .
entertaining , and believable plot . characters were realistic and i enjoyed seeing them play their parts well . would recommend it for an evening 's fun activity .
this movie caused me to wonder if there might be some truth to the story ... ? excellent performances , graphics , and cast .
i had seen this movie at the theater already , but i loved the plot but had to watch it with some friends who have not seen it before and they loved it as well
i found this movie to be very watchable , good action with a little bit of humor , not bad for a foreign film .
i liked this movie . i was not a fan of the tv show , but this was funny and entertaining . i have had a small problem with streaming but it seems to be with roku
kinda of a chick flick but it was a funny movie and i really enjoyed watching it with the wife and kids .
ok acting but good action scenes ; worth a watch for a home rental . keep in mind these are not real actors .
now i have all 4 movies ! i love scary movies . especially the scream series ! i grew up when they came out .
just a great movie all around . warm , loving , inspirational , and not sappy at all . well worth the money and time . will watch it every year .
great quality . the story line is good . forces you to watch part 3. the voices seem the same . the characters stories are pretty good .
possibly the best season of this show , every season i think of getting showtime just to be able to watch the next one faster .
have the whole collection of john wayne now . watch them over and over all the time . a man to look up to .
this is a great hip workout , but it 's longer then i have time for . nothing wrong with the workout , though . it 's fun !
night court season 3 was just as funny as seasons 1 & 2. i would definitely recommend this dvd set to anyone who enjoyed night court in the 80s .
this is the first season of the show . it is very funny . there are many jokes and no commercials . many funny episodes to enjoy .
i really enjoy watching these movies and how the storyline and characters develop . would recommend them to anyone who enjoys period films .
stupid quick fun . great cast and some edgy humor that keeps me coming back for more . i really enjoy the show .
i am very pleased with my purchase . it was sent very quickly and in great condition . the movie was very colorful and the birds were great .
my wife loved it and i just followed along . it was a good movie i guess . my wife read the book first and liked it even more so i guess it was good
this was a great sifi series from the 70 's . i would definitely recommend it to sifi lovers .
this is one of the best gay love movies made . you wo n't be dissapointed .
what can you say about this movie , except that it is a classic ! everyone should watch this movie at least once . meryl streep is awesome , as usual . i recommend it .
purchased this as a gift for my husband . he is a big twilight zone fan . he has watched the shows several times .
i can always count on ben affleck to produce an awesome movie . everything was performed to a 10 , even the musical score .
these collections are great for kids . i am so glad they have these available on dvd . we own the rest of the volumes
i love this movie when i seen it in the theaters so of course i had to buy it when it came out ! ! ! !
my son loves this movie , and we enjoy watching it together . some parts are a little mature for younger kids , but overall a good , fun , enjoyable movie .
the dvd was damaged and could n't play the full dvd ; many parts of the movie was damaged and unable to watch .
this is a great family movie , and it show 's how a family becomes closer together , when a loss hits home ... ..
love this show . season 1 was ok , but i decided to check out season 2 and it was much better .
i love this show . they do n't make shows like this anymore . great family fun . received them fast too . great service .
mrs. miracle is an excellent movie and i watch this over and over and over . i can just about quote the script but i do n't care - i love it .
picture quality is very good . movie in same genre as `` last man on earth '' vincent price and `` i am legend '' will smith .
pretty funny ! nothing tops the first one but it 's funnier than hangover 2. purchased it right after i watched it .
nothing original here , van damme has had better movies . not realistic , but did n't expect that . problem was that even the action was a little dull .
fun , human , and believable ride through the relationship between the hitchcock couple . makes me interested in learning more about the master of suspense .
enjoyed the movie . we saw it just before we saw red 2 and would tell everyone that it was full of action and so funny
love to watch these kind of movies because i can reflect back on history . i love charlton heston in just about everything i have seen him play in .
i 'm glad that this was released on bluray . the visuals and audio are top notch . this will always be a classic movie .
movie was different than expected - it was n't great and it was n't horrible so rated it okay ! bill murray was in more serious role and that was odd for me .
so compelling , intriguing , with good actors . i have fell in love with british series and this is my favorite . bring more please
as someone who has watched the original film over and over i found this to be a nice remake which i really enjoyed . nice action movie .

i enjoyed this cartoon very much . it was very entertaining . i am happy it is finally out on dvd . thank you .
the movie is pretty entertaining but the acting is pretty weak . i like taylor but he 's not the greatest actor on the planet ... but he looks good !

this was funny , sad , and every other emotion . so glad i watched it . wish there were more series like this one .

i loved this and really hope they have a second season so i know what happens . it has spooky parts and great to watch it the dark .
it 's one of those situations one hopes never happens . the acting is good and the story line is quite riveting .
i actually purchased this for my oldest son to complete his twilight saga collection . he loves it . guess it 's great for anyone that is into this movie series .
i bought this for someone else and i may borrow it and watch it sometime .
if blues music is your thing then you will love this movie . the story line is a bit bizarre but the music is outstanding . a must see for blues lovers .
the story is good the acting is good the knowledge of the system seems in line with what i know it to be the emotions are true . the scenery is beautiful along with the clothing
dr. quinn , medicine woman was one of the best series ever on modern television . great family viewing . i highly recommend it .

must have for the family and each kid . good story , good concept , good morals . love it , so does my daughter .
this is a very funny movie- light hearted and absolutely goofy . it is light and entertaining . i recommend it if you just want to laugh at something .
these movie always make me cry ! good actors and great plot . must see with your loved ones . it a beautiful movie !
even though a 70s movie it was interesting and also erotic ... .. had obviously sexual content not for under 17 ages
i am a gary cooper fan , enjoy all his movies as i see them , but do not think this is one of his better movies .
i think this is the first jennifer lopez movie that i actually liked . plenty of action and the ending will have you sitting on the edge of your seat . just a great movie .
one of the best movies of all time ! very good movie . the actresses in this movie were superb ! the best .
all of these are the greatest . can not wait for the 7th one to come out . so sad about paul walker .
one of the best series on tv maybe of all time excellent store and i 'm finding out more truth than fiction
if you 're a big fan of the old show , you 'll love this set . clear picture , good sound . an absolute delight .
i do n't purchase tv series very often , but this one is a keeper for sure . i recommend it to any fantasy fan out there .
this movie was good , i was expecting some independent movie but no , i got a good one . = ) i 'm surprised that this movie does n't have a higher rating !
very fun movie it 's great to watch with the whole family and it will have everyone rolling with laughter i love this movie !
still funny after all these years . the quality of the bluray makes the movie look like it was filmed 10 years ago instead of 20
we really enjoyed this movie and i was surprised . i just did n't think we would like as well as the first but it was superb . i ca n't wait to see more of these .
it 's difficult to find movies that are entertaining and appropriate for families , but this one fits the bill . enjoyed it with my grandson
i could n't watch the whole thing . bad acting and special effects . i wish i had n't wasted the money on this thing .
kept my attention and was about what i expected . how do you go wrong with cusack and cage . i enjoyed it .
good movie if you like the older classics - good acting - not on the top of the list but worth buying if the price is right .
this movie is very well done and is surely worth the price and i 'm glad to have it in my collection .
it is a great movie . mirren was fantastic . also , renting it off amazon was wonderful . we were visiting my mother and we were able to really enjoy it with her through amazon
if you are a fan of are you being served the bbc television series , then you 'll enjoy this movie ! it 's wonderful british humor and characters really are great !
really good movie great action definitely great remake . well done action and lots of it . ca n't wait for the next one
although well drawn and filmed this movie goes nowhere without much reason . thin characters , plot forgotten , and ending that simply loses . anyone want my copy ? free !
i loved this movie . sad in the beginning but it does a fine job of showing how family members can move passed the tragedy , and honor the person 's life .
this the best version of the musical and the blue ray brings out the great story and original production in its full sound and color . it is worth getting .
the story of tina turner is heartwarming . the story line was riveting and the music phenomenal . loved every minute of it .
i loved this when it first came out and now my 5 year old grand daughter and i are enjoying it again !
this a great horror movie with a twist . it is better than what the reviews have given it . i would recommend this movie .
the audio is better than the video in this stupid and dumb movie . i 'm glad i will be returning it .
pretty good movie . the boys in the movie are great and the theme of innocence and trust takes you back to another time .
a movie that you could watch over and over again . the animation is awesome and the story lots of fun . a great movie for young and old .
i have been a stargate fan since the beginning . i have seen the movie a couple of times and i still enjoy it . rent , buy , enjoy ... .
mediocre at best story line was bad ; dry and predictable only action scenes drew interest . they used one liners from previous movies .
while watching this collection i laughed and laughed . she is one of the best comedians that i never tire of watching .
excellence suspense , from non other than daniel craig himself . and excellent story , with may plot holes . some come together during part of the movie , but the ending will shock you
just a nice movie to watch again after so many years of all the stallone classics ( rocky 's , rambo 's , etc . ) henry winkler and perry king are also in this one !
i love this show . it 's so funny and realistic . well , for a cartoon anyway . i recommend that any fan buy this complete series . you wo n't be disappointed . : - )
great movie . love old movies and this one is up there in favorites . cagney and fonda deliver a good movie . a must have if you have an oldies collection .
this movie is a cult classic for its raunchy small town humor ! i appreciate the typical characters that are n't played so typically . definitely worth the buy !
i liked the characters in this movie and the play between the various characters . very realistic characters and situations , too .
i remember seeing this movie after it first came out . it is still a good plot , but for me the movie has n't held up with time . seems outdated .
excellent movie , the british knew how to do it right . i love the coen brothers , but their remake of this comedy was lame , lame , lame !
great set was cheaper for all 3 , compared to the single movie in the local store . like how they were each on their own dvd
story was n't that great but action scenes were decent . would recommend this only if you love comic adaptations and or like the wolverine comic character .
a great show and i could n't believe the price , it was stupid not to buy it so i got my copy and a great deal .
great action adventure burton and eastwood at there best good story with a fast pace no dull bits , loads of shoot them up , blow them up , good stuff .
his movie is one of my favorites . ben affleck was terrific and i can see why it was an academy award winner .
i have bought everything by tyler , plays and movies . this one is so funny . add this to your library and you wo n't be sorry . you can relate to the characters very easily .
this movie would easily fall into my top twenty favorite films . it has romance , comedy , and tragedy rolled up into one . it has subtitles , but it is well worth the watch .
funny and kinda sexy . purchased it cause it fits the classic genre of comedy / horror movies . costume and makeup is good .
could n't even make it through it , did fast forward a little to see if it got any better , it did not !
the first movie was the best and the second was a repeat of the first . not much originality , but still full of action .
i wanted to purchase the movie , not just rent it . funny , cute , silly , and enjoyable are just a few words to describe it . kid safe . recommended .
has to be the best ever dvds of all time . very funny couple who are the best at acting . amazing .
with this i have one more volume to go and i have the whole series . and that 's all i want , to have the entire season of what i grew up with . volume 2 next .
got my dvd very quick , and the dvd works great . my grandkids are very happy with this dvd . thank you .
this is a must have for anyone who is new to blu ray . the lord of the rings in blu ray , especially with great surround system is awesome . let me say it again awesome .
this is one of my favorite cartoons . i was very pleased to find it and receive it in a very timely manner and in such good condition . i am very pleased with this order .
the standard disc special edition is just as good as the hd version of this movie .
i was disappointed in this movie . the cast was great but the story was slow and not to my taste .
my children love watching the old horror movies ( not really that scary so great for kids ) . they love collecting these old movies .
this was my coming out flick on first date ! it was nice seeing it decades later ! great print and great extras !
how can you not like the best news team around ? and in hd their delivery is even better ! this is a must have in anyone 's home video collection : - )
loved this movie . definitely worth a viewing . fight scenes were fun to watch and she still looks good ! ! ! i think you need to rent this . you will smile and feel happy .
i watched it , package was shipped excellent and i love the show . so it was worth the price to me , everyone should have a copy .
i love this mini series . i ca n't find the 2nd or 3rd movie . if anyone knows where i can buy it , please let me know .
this is a classic movie with great acting and with great legendary actors i would recommend that those who want to experience the christian faith need to get this movie .
i love super hero movies , especially ones with robert downey jr. in them . did you know he can sing ? the hulk is pretty good too .
eddie murphy is just genius in this buddy cop movie . if you are only familiar with the shrek version of eddie murphy , then this is worth the watch .
this show was the best show i ever saw . i still watch it every chance i get . i plan to buy the dvd as well .
movie is very intelligent . i enjoyed it a lot . ending was depressing , but most good movies are . it 's a keeper .
this movie was better than expected as i thought it was going a different direction based on the trailers i 've seen . if you are into thoughtful sci-fi , then you might enjoy this one .
good movie but i still do n't get what the point of it was . kind of strange if you ask me .
this movie has turned my 4 year old daughter into a cinderella freak ! my older sons ' roll their eyes at the thought of watching it but she loves cinderella !
i love the episodes and you will also . it makes you want to buy all the seasons like i did .
a good fun movie that anyone could watch a few times . some movies you see once and that is it , this one you can watch once in a while and still like it .
exciting heart warming funny adventurous movie my kids watch it i think like a million times over lol . they just love these little guys .
all of the shows are interesting to watch , but u can only watch them so any times , but they are good .
i am a tom cruise fan and he again did not fail to impress me . he is charming , never give up agent .
it 's definitely much funnier than the american version . i could watch it over and over .
my husband does n't like movies or most regular sitcoms ... .but , this is one program we can sit down and enjoy together in the evenings when we want .
great to see hepburn & tracy ` s chemistry on screen . they are so cute together in this movie as it was in the beginning of their off screen relationship .
with the 7th season of roseanne , there 's only 2 more seasons left to be release ! ! & hope they do so as fast as this show ' been release on dvd ! !
i bought this movie as a gift to a friend . i have not seen the movie . i repeat , i bought this movie as a gift to a friend . i have not seen the movie .
this was a gift he loves this movie and did n't own it . i 'm so glad i was able to find it for a good price on here . it was worth the money .
product was exactly how it was described , arrived very quickly and in good condition . would definitely recommend this product to someone . love this show , favorite show
i like a good western or comedy and some drama , but i find it is so easy shopping at home and having the movie when i want to watch it . i 'm very pleased .
really enjoyed the story . great dvd , it came in very good condition . would highly recommend this . good price for a great story .
its somewhat outdated and so are the songs . i guess i was bringing back some of those days .
i like bruce , so it was a interesting concept , good and action packed . a must see in the bruce collection of movies
these are the best movies for children . the movies teach lessons and morals to our children and for this i am thankful .
several newer buddy movies have been made but none can replace the original bill and ted . they are the best .
maybe i had great expectations of this movie but , i have to say , i really did n't enjoy it as much as the previous ones .
this movie delivers a heart warming story and shows how great little children can be and how people can change based upon their life experiences .
i have never seen this program when it was on . but it was out there with the graphics and the story line of what if .
these was a sweet love story . i 'm a huge basketball lover , so i got to see that along with a cute story line and was very happy at the end of the movie .
this movie was fantastic to watch . i was shocked that i would like it but i enjoyed it so much i watched it twice .
for all that is said about this movie it is really enjoyable for me to watch and i like the message it gives .
best movie , kids love it , wholesome for my 2 year old . funny for me and the wife .
this movie is a classic . i ca n't say which i like better , this one or the new one . they are both awesome movies . john wayne is one of my all time favorite actors .
i enjoy seeing an old show that had good acting and scripts to keep one 's interest . i remember watching it with my parents .
was a great movie i love all the madea movies , worth watching , me and my family could not stop laughing
i 've always been skeptical of remakes and rarely seen one that does justice to the source material , but i am legend is not just a remake , it sets the bar .
very nicely crafted musical . excellent acting and singing . the music was great . i could watch this musical many more times .
good movie that has english subtitles but i could n't find this information anywhere on the page . it would be nice to know this before i rent a movie .
this is one of the greatest comedies of british t.v . dawn french is wonderful . a delightful show . full of great actors and great and funny writing ! !
i bought this movie because i like the spiderman movies . it turned out to be good . all spiderman movies are good .
started this series just to see what it was about , and loved it . i wish they would have done more seasons . i would encourage anyone to check it out . most excellent .
excellent action film . great ending story to this version of the batman trilogy . great gift if given with the first two movies in blue ray hd .
this is one of many and it is hands down the best tv series that was ever on public tv channels
do n't let the fact that it 's subtitled stop you from getting this movie . there 's good action all around and great cinematography . if you like gangster films you should definitely give this a try .
the film to me was a waste of time ! it did not seem worth the time to watch nor worth the money .
i liked this movie and had to get it for myself . it is an adventure and a half . it is very funny . probably the best from michael douglas .
it was very very used with water damage to the case . i do n't know which company sent me the dvd ?
this is probably one of the best films in recent years . i really enjoyed , and recommend it . i am looking forward to watch the sequel .
i was surprised by this movie . i was n't expecting much from it but it turned out to be really good .
awesome and a must in your work out program . my husband and i enjoy doing it together . it is something we can both do and feel good about it .
must not have been that great dont remember it even so not sure what to say here except not sure
my whole family enjoys watching it together . it brings back a lot of memories . being in blu-ray makes it even better for viewing . highly recommended for big and small kids , young and old adults .
only saw the preview but a very good show . very strong and powerful . fun to watch and boring at all .
who doesnt like the matrix movies they are non stop adventure and action were ahead of their time for sure .
this movie is great , it makes you want to see it again . the actors were really good in this movie , a must buy
i really enjoyed this movie ! ! kept me on the edge of my seat ! some scenes could of been done better
this is a great police show and i do n't normally like police shows . it is gritty , real and human . very believable .
i truly enjoyed the acting and the actors . this movie apparently is true to dickens ' life and it is an amazing life .
loved the original and i love this . steve martin is the greatest . ellen green is a fabulous singer .
definitely not the duke 's best or the film makers best . however , still an icon when it comes to westerns though .
i bought this for my daughter , who loves it . she is interested in fashion and said this was a must for you library .
this one is well done and a classic masterpiece . the acting is top notch and the effects are pretty good and convincing .
i love john wayne movies . i watched them as a child with my family . good memories . i would recommend this movie .
the movie was great , but it was a little bit hard to follow . much better watching it the second time .
a very good , simple horror flick . not the most original plot , but very enjoyable . mostly solid acting .
cant wait for them to come out with new seasons . at times it can get just too stupid but it 's funny .
love it i was looking for this movie a long time had the vhs ca n't find it so i bought the down load love it
we loved this well acted movie ! it was funny and had story that was well told . too bad more of this did n't happen in real life ! !

this was so good that i ordered copies for my friends . what a documentary ! it grabs you from the very start and stays with you for a long time . totally stunning !
i took my daughters to see this many many years ago , and i knew my grandsons would like it ! such a cute movie with a great message about friendship !
another white house attack movie . this movie is action packed and there are some fun parts in the movie.i m a big jamie foxx fan .
the dvd has special features and the movie itself is the best . disney movies are the best thank you : )
i like to watch some shows and this is a way to see the ones i like since i do n't have a tv hooked up right now
i enjoy jesse stone : tom selleck 's superb . this episode has a lot of jesse . set up for the next episode . dialogue much like the old noir films . fast , furious .
another of disney 's fun movies . it is great to watch all these years later
this is creativity at its best . the writers on this show are great ! i really enjoy watching the actors on this show .
i am a classic movie buff , and these shows may be b and c rated , but nobody can find this anywhere else - i am so happy !
just classic ! where else can one see batman sing and dance in new york ? ! ! ! great musical for the entire family !
great movie . probably one of my favorites of the year . absolutely hilarious . it takes a lot for me to give a 5 star rating , but this movie deserves it .
awesome season once again . you will want to get the fifth season right away after you watch this . the whole series is amazing !
i saw this movie the first time on tv . i fell in love with the movie . i am a huge sam elliott fan so i knew it had to be good and decided i wanted to own it
i give this product five stars because it was a gift for a friend . he really liked it . i recommend this to everybody .
another of clint eastwood 's best films . i wish it had been in high definition , but it is still a great film . amazon prices are just right , and the service is excellent .
love sandra bullock she is great . this is a feel good great chick flick . i love this show . it is a great chick movie
i remember watching this film a few times as a kid . this has been the first time that i saw it since then . this was as good as i remembered it to be .
i have to tell you , i had none of the problems the other reviewer had , i have this set and the horror one , and have enjoyed nearly all of the movies on both .
this is a fun look at what we thought the future was going to be . the show was skipping over a few things from the movie but is humorous to watch ,
good story about a variety of people and events that impact their life . it 's nice to see a movie about older adults .
ca n't get enough of this - love the collection - hours and hours of laughter at my house , my friends enjoy this collection .
i rated this a 5 star cause my sister in law likes this move and i got it for her
hey we have the first 2 , it would n't be complete with out the 3rd . robert does such a great job being so serious . just makes it even funnier .
excellent comedy . witty . if the rest of the episodes are as fine as the first episode i may be up all night watching them .
it has so many classic bits and pieces of horror movies but seems to combine them into a truly unique movie . it is getting a bet dated but still one i enjoy watching every year or so .
im a beatles guy and i love it its a cool interpretation and its a fun watch . a decent re-watch also . have fun .
my collection of i love lucy is finally complete . i watched it as a kid and she 's still fun to watch today .
great music , great dancing . the more i watch it , the more i appreciate about it . i highly recommend it for all ages .
this is one of my favorite movies . its kinda a comedy , kind of a drama . i saw the musical version in london , not as good as the movie !
talk about eye candy ! this movie sure has a lot of it . but even with all the great bodies the storyline is real and dramatic . highly recommend it .
i love both of these actresses . oh my goodness , i laughed until i cried . melissa mccarthy gives new meaning to funny .
taylor is great in this one , he looks very nice in this movie , i am a big fan and i would get this all anytime
loved this season . i still liked season one better than this , but i was pretty damn entertained nonetheless . watch it !
the personalities of these four actresses blend for delightful comedy . writers continue to be entertaining in their portrayal of these characters .
this movie while predictable at times , does have an unexpected ending . overall i enjoyed watching this film and there is solid acting in it .
cant wait for the next season to start . my son turned us on to this series . my wife and i could not just watch one episode at a time . thanks amazon prime !
this story makes a person really think about things ... the unknown . i recommend it to everyone - whether westerns are a favorite or not . it 's just a good movie !
i purchased this as a christmas gift for a true fan and because of their love of the team and it 's history i rated it a 5 .
this comedy with burt reynolds is so funny . the movie had a good plot . for classic movies this is a must for any library .
my husband and i both loved this movie and actually watched it twice in one weekend ! the acting was outstanding and a very accurate telling of the story !
i love this movie . if your a fan of vampires , you should watch this . there is a lot of action in it . : )
this is a great boxset if you are a stephen king fan ... .i got this boxset as a present & i love it ... .i would recomment this boxset .
this was a good sequel to the first . its a great movie with an all star cast . it 's definitely worth seeing .
good movie if you like military movies . good addition to my video library , i would recommend it to most . thats all folks .
ok so it 's a cheesy flick that did n't really challenge harmon 's true abilities as an actor . but it was fun , saw it years ago and wanted it for my dvd library .
this is the only copy that i can find that has the original star wars . it is great to find a copy left with out all the horrible added stuff .
this movie had it all -- a good story , a good cast , sadness , joy , determination ... i was drawn into the movie . well worth the time .
thought it was going to be entertaining , instead it was boring and crude . worst film ever rented on amazon , had to turn it off could n't bear to watch the end .
it 's a good movie with an excellent movie stars as brad pitt , buy it .
this is a very good show in my opinion . i love the actors and found it originally on netflix . watched every show from the first one and was hooked like a good book .
this is a must for superman fans - great - also had old george reeves as superman on it ( i watched as a kid )
but , now i ca n't stop watching ! ! it 's like a history lesson , only way more interesting ! ! i am enjoying it very much !
myself and family all loved this dvd and it is just a real fun fill family dvd ! good service and great price ca n't get any better !
my entire family really enjoyed this movie . i think it makes a difference when you know it is based on a true story and that people with true courage and integrity still exist in this world .
so i have an hd bluray player and this cd would not play on it so i was very disappointed . therefore i can not give it the rating it deserves .
if you like anime with humor you 'll love this . i bought this for my son who collects anime and it 's one of his favorites .
a lot of action and tom cruise plays a great tough guy . robert duvall comes on late to provide a bit of comic relief as only he can .
i bought the movie for the dance scene and then discovered i liked the whole thing . great story and something for everyone .
good movie , scares you big time , it is tense , and the graphics from dvd to blu ray are awesome . i 'm still waiting for the other 2 to be in blu ray .
i was thrilled to get this . big fan . i can watch this over and over . it got to me very fast .
i love kim possible show that why i miss all the show so i have to get it on dvd . so you can watch it over and over again .
i bought this movie for myself because i just loved john wayne and there are certain movies that i had to have and this was one one them .
... again , then again and again , or again , but again , perhaps again maybe then again after seeing it again and again , but definately again one more time just to be sure !
no matter how many times we watch this series , it still keeps us laughing !
this is the second time to see hunger games . jennifer lawrence is truly an amazing talent for someone so young !
kind of gets boring about half way through the movie . no , i would not recommend this movie to anyone . just expected better acting and special effects .
it was a decent movie . way to many movies out there to get so specific about any one movie but this was a good 2 hours of escape .
if you like bruce willis or if you like die hard movies then you 'll like this . the & # 34 ; son & # 34 ; was a good addition . i 'd watch it again .
this is a good movie that shows the substance of genuine childhood friendships . one of those movies you enjoy over and over again .
love this movie , love this genre , disc came in in very good condition . no problems with this one at all .
loved this movie ! four of my favorite actors in one movie together , a well written script , and good support . it was great fun from beginning to end , and did not disappoint !
the only reason to see this movie is to check out the two & quot ; heads & quot ; having sex . which means the movie is really not worth seeing ...
it just could n't be ! i 'm gon na sell the other 2 and get this . this is so cool ! man this is is gon na be so cool !
how wonderful and innovative . if you ca n't inspire with this one , you wonder what it would take !
for the most part the set was in good condition . however , the first disc was scratched and was forced to order back to the future by itself .
i thought that this movie was great . i liked to watch it and i would recommend this to someone else
dragged on and just made me want to go to sleep . a waste of a great cast .
loved it , loved it , loved it ... ... he always says the right thing . he is so much fun to listen to and watch . a must have if you love good clean comedy .
i loved this movie it was very funny to watch with the little creatures they are fun to watch over and over again
it has been awhile since i saw this movie , but i love john wayne in anything , but love him in comical roles .
this movie is great and was delivered promptly in great packaging . it 's fun , family friendly and actually funny . i can not say enough good things about this product .
this was a gift i picked up for a friends kids : they enjoy it very much each time they watch it
i just loved the show so much that i had to get the dvd such a funny heartwarming show and really talented cast of characters . will definitely get season 2 also ! !
this is a good example of how bad a movie can be , what a terrible sequel to a good movie in the first behind enemy lines .
i used to like this series when it was on network tv . this dvd brings back pleasant tv memories ! i like it .
this is a great story . the main character is really creepy and makes you wonder how many other little kids are just like her .
a classic with a disney twist . great value , all discs and the digital copy included . if you like disney , or want a holiday movie with a twist , this is a great program for you !
this was an interesting movie . they should really remake it if they have n't . i think it is just as appropriate now as it was then .
great story , great acting , very real to life -- this movie grabs your attention and holds it to the end . i do n't know how the oscars missed it .
great western . keeps you thinking . if you like westerns of old this is a must see . good family film to watch .
i loved this show when it was on television and nothing has changed . it 's still one of the best shows out there . i only wish the first four seasons were available as well .
we have a tradition of watching several classic christmas movies every year & this is one of them , have to have the version with boris karloff .
it was entertaining and has the action that is lacked in the book . nice twist and surprise even to the fans of the book series . worth seeing even if you do n't like the books .
these old musicals bring back childhood memories . old films with the stars of the past make for an enjoyable evening .
this is a movie that is really dumb , but extremely funny . diaz did a great job as did most of the other members of the cast .
have watched a couple episodes . it seems like an alright show just nothing to write home about or spectacular . will watch a few more but think i will not watch all
the product arrived in 2 weeks in excellent conditions . this is a very funny dvd with no more than what is told it has .
i purchased this item after i started watching the american version on the syfy channel and although i have n't watched it yet , i know it is going to be great ! ! !
movies was good but i must say isnt my favorite . maybe thats just me . but the last 1 was soo much better
fred and ginger at their best very entertaining and their dancing is superb . a must have for anyone who loves dancing
enjoyed this depiction of the bible story . the music is good and the characters really bring the story to life .
i really enjoy the newer bond movies over the old ones . all though they are all classics : ) very satisfied customer ! looking forward to purchasing from this seller again .
very fun , family friendly and think it should return to tv so kids can watch it after school instead of some of the shows that are on now ...
bought for a gift for my son . he really enjoys comedy . it was a nice addition to his dvd collection .
wanted this after watching it on netflix ... so i purchased it .. i am glad a i bought it .. now i am looking forward to the believe movie
this is without a doubt the best transformers series out . very in depth and captivating characters . looking forward to season 3 .
i was n't sure what to expect so i was n't too let down , the actors and the movie itself are alright but a cute movie is n't my type .
just right - gets 10 stars from me ! excellent movie - vendor : thank you soo much ! i enjoyed sooo much - keep up the good work !
this is the superb ultimate musical , its the very best of the best , hands down ! there is nothing more to say .
all of steven seagal movies leaves a great impact on me . to watch him move and talk , wow , what else can i say . buy this dvd
this movie was so good , i bought another one for my granddaughter . its hard to find good clean movies anymore .
this is a wonderful movie ( quality and all ) that has a serious but funny message attached , and you will leave with a very good understanding to what has happened to our america as we know it .
i had seen the movie a long time ago . it was just as good as i remembered . would recommend it .
daniel craig is looking a bit past it , but the acting performances were very good . i like the introduction of a new m .
i just finished watching this movie on lifetime . i really enjoyed it . it had a great story line , beware though ... it 's 4 hours long ( with commercials ) . : )
hilarious and entertaining . just like all of mel brooks ' work . i have always been a big fan of mel brooks .
i had this movie on video tape . it is a modern classic , so i got it on dvd . i need the second movie to complete the set .
very enjoyable concert . viewing dvd is almost as good as seeing the concert live . recommend purchasing this dvd .
this is a classic series . it was great to own it finally for a very decent price . it keeps me coming back .
one of the best i 've seen in a long time ! ! ! i thank god that i own it ! praise jesus ! get this movie and you will not regret it !
love , love , love this series . : - ) this is the second of the series that i have enjoyed , and can not say enough about the series and the characters .
i understand that they only made 6 of this movie with karloff , do you have the other 5 ? ? ? . i would download them today .
really funny . yeah . kind of . then it gets pretty old . but i will say anthony and jamie really out did themselves in this one .
i think that this was the best of the series so far . i do hope that there are still movies in the making . they are actually half decent to watch . lets have some more .
i like the movie . my boys have watched it 1 million times . i would recommend the movie . i like all 3 of them . i think will smith and tommy lee jones are hilarious together .
i love this movie . it is funny , sweet , and touching without being sappy . definitely worth buying !
good storytelling with a quirky point of view . i watched it with interest although it was obvious how the story would turn out .
this guy is very very funny . the routine is clean so ok for kids to listen to . it is well worth watching .
i like this show , it was good . most anything kate hudson plays in i like . it was funny and silly
bought this to complete my collection . this series is a must have . it 's as funnier than you remember it because now , you can actually get the jokes .
dead again has many twist and turns and you might find yourself trying to figure it out before the answer comes . good luck with that . great script and even better acting .
this is a good family movie . my grandchildren love it . they were quite during the whole movie . it was worth my money .
quite simply a classic -- fantastic ! ! ! this is one of the movies disney made in england . pretty much all of those movies are terrific !
this movie has everything in it to make you feel it all from the bottom of your soul ... it hits home on so many levels ...
movies with this kind of plot tend to drag . they are too predictable . its too easy to see where its going . there is little or no suspense . this was no exception unfortunately .
i did not enjoy this movie as much as the first couple in the series . it is still good but not the wonder with the first harry potter . it is also a little too dark .
i found the acting superb . but , the movie a little too slow . though , i did like the way the story was told .
thoroughly enjoyed this movie . i love the romance developing between the two main characters . i watch this one over and over .
i read every book and watched the films ten years all to get to the final battle ... and it was glorious .
in a word - super . this is one of the best films of its genre and will be an outstanding addition to your collection .
again excellence in the comedy field of sitcoms . now i have to purchase season 4. ca n't wait to see it ! ! !
this was my very first blu-ray purchase . it looks spectacular and i recomend this buy even if you already own the dvd , it 's worth the upgrade .
these are done every bit as well as a hollywood production . both actors are excellent as sherlock and watson . hope to see more of these in the future .
i originally thought this movie was going to be a sleeper but as the plot of characters began to develop i started to understand the real concept of the story which i enjoyed to the very end .
loved the movie because of the meaning of the movie . would recommend this movie to anyone . would like this movie in dvd `
i liked the new way the movie found a way to project terror . it used a completely different type of story and version of what is scarey than most recent movies .
on all movies for kids he like them , thanks will buy more its only a movie not much to say ok .
my mother loves these old movies and the price was right i would recommend this movie if they are the types of movies interested in
this is a classic and no matter when i watch it i still cry at various scenes , great classic movie
i love old movies and i like to host a black and white movie night every once in a while for my friends . we enjoyed this collection , very crisp image and great sound recording .
very long movie but pretty good story . did n't expect too much bit turned out to be better than i thought
hilarious romantic comedy . enjoyed this so much more than the better known white christmas ( which is just a horrible movie ) . even the kids enjoyed it .
i had already seen this movie several times on vhs . i wanted an upgrade to dvd so i bought it . the dvd is in great condition . i have no complaints . : - )
we love these series . we watch it every weekend , and truly enjoy every episode so far . i wish today 's movies were made like these .

this movie also was packaged well and is in good condition . it is a good family movie , and i recommend it to anyone and all ages . thanks .

simon baker is such a good actor . who would n't like this show with him in it !
purchased this movie for my grandchildren . they seemed to enjoy it very much . thanks to amazon prime for many movies for all of the family .
i really liked this bond because pierce brosnan is in it and i liked his girl in the one too .
buying all three of these classics for the stated price is a real good deal . these have always been 3 of my favorites with john wayne .
this movie is really funny . it is better the second time then it is the first time .
if your a fan , then you should own this in your collection . if you are not , you need to get this and check it out . such a great show . great acting . great scifi stories
i really love disney movies , especially the older ones that i grew up with , and although this one is a little bit newer , it is a really great one !
this was a great story and movie ... i can watch this over and over again and never get tired of seeing it .
this is one of the few movies series that i would show to my kids . very clean and very well done , much like the first one . well worth watching .
an excelent series . it 's a must have ! the laughs keep coming every time i watch it .
one of my favorite star trek movies . it 's wonderful to see a younger tom hardy do a magnificent job in his role .
this is such a great coming of age movie mixed with some eerie stuff too . stephen king always does it right
i chose this item , because heard it was a great movie , i would recommend this item to everyone of all ages , item packed great .
i 've watched this movie since i was a kid and its such a great movie ! action , adventure and comedy . : )
my husband and boys love the walker series and this is another great one to see ! ! i recommend getting this .
you ca n't go wrong with this installment of national treasure . it 's fast paced , gripping and all around great picture . another fun ride ! .
if your into vampires and scarey things it 's quite good set it 's worth getting it .
i enjoy the program but missed most of the 5th season . i like the fact i have the option to do so with my kindle .
spectacular scenery and amazing footage of not only the snowy river area of australia but of some pretty amazing horses and some of the things you have to see to believe .
very bad movie . very slow at the beginning and the end is just plain ridiculous . the idea could be developed to make a much more interesting movie . definitely not recommended .
this movie showed our aged . we actually were around to see these shows as they were presented to the public .
awesome cast . great effects . good story even if you have n't seen the other series . would definitely recommend checking it out .
not as hilarious as the first movie , but was still funny . this is worth seeing , a pretty good movie . thumbs up
great movie - my hubby enjoyed this one - he loved watching the series and this is what i believe began the series . he was really glad to receive it for christmas .
i watched this many years ago and the movie stuck in my mind . enjoyed it again and happy to add it to my collection .
i always enjoy the ice age movies . great animation and characters . light-hearted and good for some laughs . bonus for the kids -- there is always a lesson that is learned from the story .
different kind of humor from your typical comedy . that 's what makes it so good . definitely recommend this movie .
my husband is the true blood fan , so he loved it . we now have them all to enjoy ! thank you .
i 'm a big fan of the old musicals and this is one of my favorites . i recommend it for anyone who has n't seen it . i love it .
i have loved this movie since i was kid . one of the best movies of all times . not much in to syfy . but this is worth it . amazing movie .
this film is well done and spencer tracy shows what a superb actor he was .
this is another hit ! the transformers movies are all great movies , full of action and incredible cgi ! this movie is ( in my opinion ) a must-see . you wo n't be disappointed . love cgi !
somewhat amusing movie about characters i had a hard time caring about played by actors and actresses i never saw before or since . on the other hand it did not cost much .
yeah i 'd watch this silly movie and did n't understand one thing about it . why do n't they just spell it out and show what the bible say ?
we love the show . great writing , cinematography , acting , suspense . it has it all ! ca n't wait to see the next show !
this is a very funny , and entertaining movie . a great comedy . lots of action and humor to keep you entertained .
not as good as the first movie , but still pretty good . missing something . the acting was very good so it is a good movie .
sadly this was the end but i would definitely like to see more of this . really nice series , very humorous .
this is easily one of my favorite movies ! and now that i 've forced it on my daughter ( like all parents force their childhood movies ) , she loves it too lol
one of my fav shows as a kid , my little ones watch it over and over til i get sick of it
saw this on amazon.com dvds and thought it looked good so brought it and it rocked like to see more movies with the leading ladies
this movie is a good movie . it is a family movie . i bought this to finish my collection of jungle book . highly recommend
this show is great , and this season was no different . great stories and great characters , i highly recommend the closer .
the sherlock holmes movies are great one 's to experience . robert downey jr. does an incredible job in playing this character .
yes margaret , they do n't make them like this any more -- i guess i am too nostalgic , but even with the new movie special effects these oldies are better in many ways .
i thought it was a pretty decent zombie movie . i think the story is fine , the zombies are creepy but not so nasty that i did n't want to keep watching .
if you like quirky movies , you will like this movie . it makes you laugh , cry and think about how actions can effect other people . definitely worth watching , in my opinion .
the cinematography was good . good effects , good sound . the story was a little too far out for us . i thought it was too graphic and too violent .
a fitting ending to a great series . enjoyed immensely . recommend to young and old ! ! you are never too old to be a kid !
just as enjoyable as i remembered . i am now on episode 22 and really look forward to continuing until the very end . it is such a treat to be able to revisit one of my very favorites .
acting is excellent on every level and mr. jason is the best . interesting look at britain 's perspective , lifestyle and locations .
unlike movies today , these tell a story that is meaningful and well worth watching . epic classics .
great visuals , but a long boring film . bought it based off hype , wo n't make that mistake again .
very good movie robert and jude make a good team . i will order from this company in the future . i am happy with order and movie .
the package arrived quickly and was in excellent condition . we are certainly enjoying it . thanks !
this is one of my favorite muppet movies , it is so cool that it is out on a disney dvd .
this movie is so touching even the funny parts make me tear up . it just proves you do n't have to have blood , weird characters and/or violence to make a great movie .
i bought this tape for my great nephew for christmas also because it was another one of his favorites . i might add that i also loved the movie .
a very suspenseful , action packed and intriguing film . well acted . second time seeing this film and it was as good as the first time we saw it . highly recommended film .
the theme was the same only with new actors . i was hoping for something a bit different but that did not happen .
i liked the first one and liked this one as well , but it 's different from the first one , maybe a little trying to hard ?
nothing much to say here . it 's well filmed , but it 's the story i do n't like . i like happy endings . do n't expect a happy ending on this one . very disturbing .
i enjoyed the movie very much . i had seen it a long time ago , but i 'm glad i bought it .
amazing cast . great writing . perfect story lines . missed the show so much since it went off the air and this has helped .
after watching new tricks on pbs we decided to buy a dvd of the show . we loved it . it is funny and entertaining . i enjoyed the way they solve the old cases together .
wow , this set is wonderful ! the show is so compelling , well-acted and a pleasure to watch . kevin spacey is amazing , but the cinematography and the script are also superb .
we enjoyed this movie . there was action and a story behind it . good all the way through . glad we rented it !
this is a good series and i have all of the seasons . they all play good too . i always liked andy .
paul newman was not just another pretty face . i think this was one of the films that proved that .
love the movie and the disc quality is wonderful . it 's a great one for your home movie library . buy it & watch & enjoy
actually this is more or less a good whole some family movie for my library collection from my past history
these are a great series of films and if you love tom selleck as i do you well really enjoy the characters .
like the story line . i can relate to the stars in show as they were of my period . good for those over 50
it was ok , not close captioned , however , i was able to enjoy it , not sure if i loved it , but it was okay
most of of have seen the movie but the special features offered with this one are a plus into seeing what goes into making a movie and the interpretation of some of the scenes by the actors and director .
just another teen show . always having to out do and out smart the adults , and life is never fair for kids .
the movie was so entertaining . the grandkids loved it as much as i did . it had a good moral story , to love our land , and take care of it .
watched this as a kid , very silly and campy ; however , some of the shows make it work . this is silly fun for when you want to laugh .
to begin with , i like the character superman and i love the action in this movie . the best superman movie ever .
i love the die hard series and will watch every single one that is ever made ! i love bruce willis !
saw the movie on tv though it was a good movie so i bought it and love it thank you
movie night movie night movie night movie night move night move night movie ... ... ... .this is i do not right i hate doing it take to long
not quite what i remember as a youth but still enjoyable enough . very british though , with some now very out of date views of the world .
this is a very heart warming christmas movie that is good for the whole family and that i have enjoyed over and over again .
this was a great movie . it 's full of action , has a great story line and a superb cast . denzel is fantastic as always
i found this dvd to be very educational and entertaining . as disturbing as some of the content , i feel it is a story that need to be told .
a great collection for those interested in wwii history . was recommended to us by a veteran , and my history buff husband is very happy with the quality of this set .
certainly a b rated kind of flick . gory in a mild kind of way in comparison to some movies in today 's choices .
received promptly in good condition . was a good copy . enjoy buying multiple dvd 's that i want but not at new prices .
both goldie hawn and george segal are in top form . this film is just raunchy enough is be really funny .
my wife told me she loves the quality of the videos and she is going to buy the rest of the set of his videos .
better then the original . it had a good pace , and awesome fight sequences . better then the original . it had a good pace , and awesome fight sequences .
this is a timeless classic which shows that those people from the depression era experienced a lot of what might have taken place in england during the time of dickens .
a lot of action in this movie . its not at the top of my most favorite movie list but it was still pretty good .
awesome , the service was fast , and exactly how the product was described to be ... the movie is very awesome by the way .
worthy film with view of the scenery on the other side of the channel . better than the french , dubbed version .
i got this for my mother and she loves it . i think she now has all the seasons . she watches them more than once and still enjoys this show .
this is a very cute movie . i have two boys and they both love it . i think it 's a good one !
i got this collection for my mom , and she stated the first disc was n't t & h , but it was still a good movie . she enjoyed others as well .
have always loved this movie , since it first came out . as my wife says , it is a great & # 34 ; heart & # 34 ; movie . highly recommend .
what can i say . roseanne is a good family show with comedy and everyday life issues . roseanne is a legend ! i grew up with the show .
fast and clean delivery of the 4th season of this wonderful series ; quality of product of first class and great price .
great movie all disney movies are the best to own never get tired of watching them i own a lot of disney movies
bought it for my grandson , it was in very , very good condition , enjoyed watching with my grandson and you will too !
i quite like this film and do not consider it a low point for spielberg . i find it very romantic and very much worth watching . i only wish it would be released in blu ray .
we were bored and did not view the entire movie . somehow it did not keep our attention . ca n't say why exactly . just not our cup of tea .
very enjoyable series that i go back to see over and over . characters work well together in a great story line .
it was a good movie . denzel washington gives a dynamic performance . the plot was good and though some parts were a little unbelievable , i really enjoyed it .
i could n't wait for it to get here and i 've watched it twice , going on my third . love it . i ca n't wait for the new season .
the story line is good and the acting better than good . if they had left off some of the language and the unnecessary rather explicit scenes , it would have been a much better movie .
great movie good price . awesome if you like transformers at all or just seeing them for the first time .
right from the beginning as always . kept us enthralled . hope that there will be more coming . jeremy renner is a good replacement for matt damon who was also very good .
you can not beat a movie that the rock is in , i just love him as a hero . this is a keeper
love these movies from when i was young and glad i got my hands on them , even more glad that they were a two pack !
i loved this series . dvd arrived quickly & in great shape . since i ca n't have the show back , this is the next best thing . thanks
excellent service ! excellent product ! what can i say ... when you 're good you 're good ! how can you get any better ? nuff said !
love bible movies . this one is done very well . really enjoyed it . the scenery is very good and keeps you interested .
newest wes anderson and i love it ! probably the best one so far ! if you like all his other films , just watch it !
the one anime series worth seeing over and over . i never get enough . so , i bought seasons 2 and 3 also . ca n't wait for more .
i got my husband hooked on this series the end of last year and he and i love watch together .
one of the best movies of all time . a must see . action , drama , and an emotionally touching hero story . you must put this on your must see list .
thank you so very much ! i love this cute and musical classic , and i 'm so happy i can enjoy it with my son ! great in every way !
this was a great film to watch . i am a sucker for christmas films and love stories . must have film .
product arrived early and looks to be in excellent condition . have not yet viewed this dvd yet so i can not comment on it 's content or how well this movie was made .
this was a really good movie which i wanted to have for my collection . i think the musical version did justice to the original film .
this is great dvd addition to my tv series collections and it arrived on time in great shape . would buy from this seller again .
i love watching these ! have bought all three seasons ! worth every penny ! ! ! classic ! ! ! i ca n't wait to watch the next generation star trek series ! !
i would n't even give this movie 1 star if i did n't have to ! it was super depressing and gave me nightmares for weeks !
love these . life made by the same people is better , but both are awesome to own .
it is a great movie , for children and adults . it has a nice story about friendship and our lord jesus . the 3d is very good and i would highly recommend everyone to get this movie
brilliant movie with a depressing ending . do n't buy it if sad movies make you depressed .
a special series of old time that is on dvd the dvd set was packed well and arrived when expected . i will probably buy more of the series
great movie - makes me cry every time i see it ! it is really a wonderful story with great acting !
we missed it when it was on the disney channel ; so i bought it and i 'm glad i did , & so is my family !
great movie . de niro is incredible in this movie . one of the best car chases ever in this movie . loaded with action and a great plot
this is not one of kevin costner 's best movies . i liked water world a lot better than this one . after saying that it is still worth watching at least once . this is my second time .
dicaprio did a great job playing his part . not a huge fan of the story but probably worth watching once . received the item quickly and as described - no complaints there : )
truly too sad to watch . i would not recommend this movie . i was not impressed with the story line . the acting was okay .
bought this for my boyfriend 's mother for christmas , and she loved it ! this is a great movie for those who grew up watching the muppets and this christmas movie .
great show . i have all 4 seasons on dvd now and ca n't wait for season 5 to be out on dvd too .
this is one of those old movies that you could watch over and over , a great job by bette , i think i will watch it again !
this is a very good movie i thought . wish it had ended differently . his grandfather lived to be an old man in real life . guess i am just a happy ending type of person .
a pretty decent horror film with a few jump scares but no real blood or gore . worth a rent but a buy . once you 've seen it once , there 's no reason to go back
so vibrant , so glad i bought the blu-ray version , it brings the movie to life . i will always have it in my collection of christmas movies .
the scenery is great ! the music is great ! this movie takes place during the depression , and i love to see how it was back then . i think this was very well done !
talk about campy but fun ! if you just want to laugh and not think about anything but how funny this movie is - buy it . this is classic !
clint eastwood is a bad ass . do i need to say anymore ? watch this movie . you will not be disappointed !
if by chance you have n't checked out the justified series you are really missing a really good show . i have purchased the whole series and really enjoy it .
definitely a must have for all dvd , blu-ray collectors . movie is pretty bit boring , but i bought for my kids so they like it .
a wonderful , inspirational story ... from beginning to end . it 's a great movie for couples to see together . a good movie .
i do n't want to spoil anything , but the movie was good overall . i sure did n't expect the outcome of the movie .
this movie is hilarious ! the laughs do n't stop with this great movie ! i highly recommend buying it ! especially , for such a low price !
love this movie from watching it on cable when i was a child . my kids have learned to love it too . good clean fun !
really enjoyed this movie and now it is in color ... .i remember the black and white version and enjoyed that one too .
this young lady is a favorite of my daughter . she does it all . this is a good fiction character for all young ladies coming into their own .
it is a good movie , plus a music cd . at times you have to listen closely because of the accent .
i like the plot of the movie and it seems to flow pretty good . the acting was great and the ending had me tear up ! omg that little girls acting .
i now have all of the seasons of house that are out . i like his humor , though it 's not for everyone .
my kids love dora , and i 'm okay with that . this particular one has a song that gets stuck in my head , but i do n't mind , its cute !
an unusual story line . the people are inside the book and by the time the movie ends you are not quite so sure if you are too or not .
this movie is one of tom hanks better pictures in my opinion . he is not trying to be arnold or stallone . he gives the captain a human aspect that is believable .
cute movie the whole family can enjoy . saw it in the theatre when it was out and had to have a copy for my personal collection .
received this item on time from amazon . always great experience dealing with amazon . enjoyed this movie from mel gibson . one of his better movies .
i 'm glad i finally replaced my video of this movie and got it on dvd , i 've been waiting a long time to do this . it 's a great movie !
i liked this movie and found it portrayed the characters and events from the original source books much better than i expected from something that was coming through disney .
very cute movie . it has a very good ending to the story which parents will like . my son loves the minions !
love the movie . it was interesting my heart almost dropped when they acted like they were going to run over her son .
a rare gem . classic cartoon from my childhood . enjoyed every episode . great for the kids an adults who are looking for great cartoons that 'll be enjoyable for the family to watch . highly recommend .
this movie keeps you on your toes and has many twists and turns . terrific acting , action and a great & # 34 ; who done it & # 34 ; film .
it 's a pretty clean movie overall , and reynolds and bullock do a good job in their roles . a pretty fun , romantic movie when you 're in the mood for that sort of thing .
not what i thought it would be , so only watched for about 30 minutes and then turned it off . sometimes its not what you think it will be .
i really wish they would come out with the other seasons . loved this show growing up & loved seeing it again now .
if you like watching some entertaining history , and feel proud to be an american this is the movie for you . this to me is a classic wwii movie .
i love this series ; i only wish it came on throughout the year rather than having to wait months and months . it is an excellent series .
i really enjoyed this movie , my wife not so much ! it was very entertaining and i would recommend it to anyone ...
what can i say ? this is another disney classic from the story line to the great music in this dvd . my 2 year old loves it !
i loved this show when it aired and watching it now , reminded me of the good old days . the dvd quality was excellent even in black and white .
the show is very good when it is trying to be funny , but the plots are hit or miss sometimes .
both movies were clean and enjoyable with a easy paced enjoyable storyline . worth the money and the time to experience .
this series arrived in excellent condition and in excellent time . any one that enjoys crime dramas makes this a must have .
i bought this for my 11 year as a gift . she has read the series and seen the movie and loves it .
i am delighted to have this film to play when i wish to , which i hope and trust will find its true audience one day .
a tour de force . a stellar cast . outstanding performances all around . an excellent period piece that captures the last days just before the start of wwii .
had been looking for this movie along time thank u for getting it to me so fast very clear movie
i like good ol ' blood and guts . that 's the only reason this got 3 stars ! this was really a `` wrong turn '' . i say enough of these ! should have stopped at 4 !
this is a great movie as well as the second one . any wwii fan should watch both movies they are awsome
a phenomenal movie weather in black and white or color the performance and the acting is very moving it is a timeless treasure that i love to watch all throughout the year
i have loved this movie for decades . the downloaded version on my amazon.com site does not disappoint . audio and picture are crystal clear .
i really liked this movie , i thought it was hilarious ! definitely adult humor , but well worth watching ! and awesome cast ! ! !
wonderful series with likeable characters . really a shame it 's stopped production . and despite what some reviewers say , this issue seems to be complete .
the product was a gift . it arrived on time and the person who received it loved it and has been using the video regularly ever since ! ! thank you !
still love this movie ! it 's an absolute favorite and i still enjoy watching it . entertaining , exciting and so much fun .
i chose this product because i have been collecting disney movies over the years and i am trying to get the whole collection in blu ray . the condition is excellent and i would recommend this to everybody .
i enjoy supernatural thrillers and this was worth a look . it was n't a new theme and the special effects were a bit disappointing at times but overall it was enjoyable .
we had never seen any of the sopranos episodes . having now viewed the entire series , i would recommend it to a relative or friend .
i thought this would be a nice girl flick but was i wrong ! the two actresses can barely act , and the script is only worse . again , good thing it 's a free amazon prime title !
first time we bought this when our girl really attention to this show in tv . and now she ask for watch this show everyday .
fun movie for the kids and funny enough that the adults will enjoy it too ...
the show is very entertaining . the plots are interesting and attention holding . the actors are excellent in their roles . all in all worth the time .
i love dark shadows when it was on tv now i can enjoy the whole collection on dvd any time i would like to watch it . enjoyed it for my years to come .
did n't like this one . the women seemed too desperate for my taste . i did like the ending though . maybe it was just my mood at the time .
i went into this movie with low expectations but it was actually a good horror flick . some good scares . ,
have read all the books ... when will there be another movie ? ? ? ? love katherine heigl ... please let 's have more !
only ever watched the first movie before did n't know that there was a whole collection we love every one of the movies
what a warm , funny , exciting movie . goldie is at her best . i liked the storyline very much . thank you much .
i have always like the three stooges i just which there were more of them i loved it what more is there to say
tradition and it 's the best christmas movie ever made . i could watch it over and over . it 's the true meaning of christmas others before self .
i always like this sort of thing . fantasy , pretty girls , action , sex . this one has it all . a good series and i 'm looking forward to the next season .
i bought this and the other one for a friend and they love them . so i am glad i was able to find it on here .
liked the story line and nice to see what a young actress looked and acted like later in life . good and warm feeling for all .
movie is mainly for the kids , which is why my son enjoys watching it over and over again . the movie is decent for adults , funny when it needs to be , and keeps you entertained .
it was everything i expected , a wonderful show , shipping was very fast . i am very satisfied with my purchase .
i did n't know what to make of this movie from the preview but it was much better than i thought it would be
the grey was very entertaining and kept me on the edge of my seat . liam 's performance was excellent . i also enjoyed the cinematography !
great family movie . my 5 and 7 year olds loved it . as parents , this is much more fun to watch than cartoons .
was extremely disappointed it this movie , it was more like watching someone playing a game , was boring ! the first judge dredd was good , was expected more of the same , but did n't get it .
loved the unexpected plot twists of this movie . great sequel to the first one ! great addition to my horror collection ! love it !
that is what i think about it two dvd where quit bad and not worth watching then but where good
this is a great movie and it shows you what some people will do for family . the rock is great in this role .
this movie is absolutely amazing ! the locations and places are as if you were watching the whole thing unfold in front of you , extremely realistic !
rent it . buy it . steal it . do whatever you have to do to see this film . wait , dont steal it .
this is a wonderful story that actually cast the right actors for the parts . i think this film will give you a good look into genius and into mental illness . loved it .
a timeless classic . i have several versions . this version being equal to the classics and my daughter 's favorite version .
did not find it funny . but that is just me . at least i did n't spend a lot of money on it .
everything you want in a western ; great story line , characters , and scenery . one of glen ford 's better movies . why ca n't they make them like this any more ?
i 'm a great fan of catherine bell , anything she is in is okay with me . what 's next for her something soon i hope .
do n't know what the ideal target audience is . 6 or 7 is too young .
the masters of the universe was my favorite show when i was a kid , and i am proud to be able to share it with my children who enjoy it as well .
love this show . it is so funny , especially the early episodes . i still wish they would release the later ones .
i do n't like scary movies . i did not buy this for myself and have never even seen it so i ca n't advise on it .
did not see this one coming . this was a great movie with a good story line . i would recomend this for the suspense .
3 great actors with good story line . makes you think about issues you know about or get 's you to think , what would i have done . reminds me how lucky i am that my dad returned .
great plot on this blue ray movie . i 've watched it many time as it does n't seem to get old .
this is one of the best movies of all time in my opinion . i got it on time and in perfect condition .
i really enjoyed this movie and the streaming quality was excellent . i had no problems at all watching this movie .
beautiful love story , clint eastwood is great as a romantic lead and meryl streep never disappoints , would recommend this dvd
i enjoyed watching this movie , and it has a good point of enjoying what you have . it was a little too much of a spoof halloween movie .
this did not interest me at all . the characters are boring and the movie is too . would not watch again .
horrible waste of money . this was a horrible movie . we could n't stand it after 30 minutes turned it off and threw it away .
again i am thrilled to see these good movies come out on blu ray . the blue ray with these quality movies are just a little more fun to watch and enjoy .
this was not the best movie i have ever seen . there were some predictable places . there were also some surprises along the way . do n't buy this movie , only rent if you have the choice .
i usually like bill murray movies . this one was just incredibly boring ! not sure why this is considered a classic .
one of my favorite movies ever . the cast was the best and tom hanks was fantastic like he always is .
very funny , a little long , but the jokes just hit the sweet spot . this will clearly be on my repeat watching list .
this is a great series of good family entertainment . you can watch these and not get surprised by foul language or adult scenes .
i would recommend this to anyone who like murder mysteries it gives you all the clues and you get a chance to work it out , very hard
i ca n't wait for series three . i have just about very holmes movie made and was skeptical about his series . i was more than pleasantly surprised .
i thought these movies were going to be alot more fun to watch but all in all they were kinda boring and just very poorly made .
if you saw walking tall you saw this , more action then story ! if you like action you would probably like this movie .
it 's pretty good . plays good too . i love it ! ! i would recommend it . it 's old 3d and not real d .
i ordered both seasons . loved this series and was very disappointed when it canceled after 2 seasons . fun series and happy to have to watch anytime ... especially when one needs a good laugh .
cant wait for the next season ! i love crime shows and this was a good one ! i will most definitely recommend it to crime show fans
picture quality was great . movie was very interesting . i 'm a robert mitchum fan from way back when ! the movie kept my attention until the very end . i loved it .
we do n't usually watch shows produced in the us , but we are enjoying the first 3 seasons . the show is never boring , even though predictable .
awful . they have sucked this franchise dry . i thought it couldnt be any worse than part 2 , i was wrong .
a good balance of story and action . they do n't make it predictable which is pleasant when so many movies get corny very quickly .
love matlock . it is a great show and fun to watch . the character played by andy griffith is loveable and you 'll enjoy the show .
i liked that i was able to get this movie at a reasonable price and that it was in good condition .
i am glad i bought this for my son . i wanted to share something with him that i loved as a child !
perfect ! perfect ! excellent ! thank you ! i really love this movie.i absolutely recommended this ! i will buy some more movies , great experience
it 's a good movie , for people of all ages . this completes my collection of the series . seller did a great job in getting it out to me .
i am only giving it 3 stars because amazon movies tend to stop in the middle to re load . it happened several times and eventually i had to start it all over again .
very good old time western . i wish there were more like this around today .
this has to be the best werewolf movie ever made . the creatures are the best i 've seen and the story is good . best ever . and i 've seen plenty of werewolf movies .
awesome movie . definitely a keeper ! fell in love with it the first time i saw it . ended up watching it twice .
short review : i really liked this movie ! imo , this godzilla looks better than the japanese godzilla ! ( ... )
part two of the series , i liked part one enough to purchase part two an watch it . very serious subject matter , not for kids .
this movie reminds one of the good ole day even when bad thing did happen , it helps us to realize we can always begin in life again and again .
even my kids like them . i 've always been a fan of this series . still would love to have his skill set .
if you are into good and original movies you 'll like this one , tom performance is absolutely awesome , i would n't be surprised if they do a remake
i liked this series ... it was gritty and raw and probably fairly accurate for the times . i liked the series & # 34 ; rome & # 34 ; better because of a better story .
one of my favorite holiday movies ! very good price , excellent packaging and super fast delivery ! my grandson and i have already watched it three times now .
i ca n't wait till the second season is out ! we rewatch it and always see something we missed the first time ! !
this movie is a very cute movie for children and adults alike . my grandsons love it as much as i do .
these actors are not singers . they ruined the beautiful story in my book . it was a dark and dirty movie .
the bible : the epic miniseries [ blu-ray ] i purchased this as a gift and the recipient was very happy with it .
this is a classic movie that still gives me a & # 34 ; creepy & # 34 ; feeling every time i see it . and the ending is great . a must see for sci fi buffs .
it 's not easy to find & # 34 ; clean & # 34 ; movies and tv . matlock is very good for that very reason . i hope additional seasons are added to the library .
great movie and great job ! this is a real collectors film from pixar . will become a classic in time . blu ray is very well put together .
my daughter loves this dvd . she watches it almost every morning and loves watching the animals and other babies while listening to the praise .
this is a good family movie with sound entertainment . i like this one and henry winkler plays in it with a good sense of humor
this preview provided me the opportunity to see if i really wanted to watch the whole movie , which i did . thanks .
i love mythology . i enjoy reading about it , but this movie was way better than expected . in the 2 movies they mentioned every god and the story behind what happened to them .
i loved this show when it was on and would recommend it to anyone who watched it or anyone who has kid that did n't see it .
was delivered in time and in very good condition , my daughter had a bunch of movies in vhs and we are replacing our favorites to dvd
season two is just as entertaining as number one . i really enjoy watching david jason play frost . each episode has lots of things going on . all modern stories . i would definitely buy this again .
so glad to have this in my collection , my favorite patrick swayze movie , its fun to watch he will be truly missed .
i love musicals and gene kelly . so i had to to have this now that its in blu-ray . glad i bought it

this is a very good movie , one of my favorites from the 60 's , and i am pleased with the quality of the dvd as well . i would recommend this product - thanks !
everything about this film and this dvd is wonderful , except that the timing of the subtitles is a bit strange at times .
just a classic quentin tarantino film and up there most of his past ones . i own and still watch it when it 's on hbo
this show is continuing to be good with each and every season . the cast is one that has so much chemistry with one another that it really is truly a great show .
excellent series . got into this show tears ago but lost track of the story . finally gon na catch up on one of my all-time favorite series .
well , i 'm a nicolas cage fan , so it 's good . the story is true enough , sad to say . if you like true crime , it 's worth watching .
grandsons loved it ... one the whole family can watch together . you will not be disappointed in buying this for your children or grandchildren .
bleach : uncut set 17 ; i love the series , and my son does too . you are either a fan or you are not . party on
season 4 was good , did n't know what to expect and it turned out to be a really good season . enjoyed it from beginning to end .
if you like seeing the challenges that face people and all they have to go thru to overcome them , you 'll love this movie . there 's something in this movie for everyone .
the script , acting , and sets were great . i like it more everytime i watch it .
we all loved this movie . then again we love nicolas cage in almost every movie he is in . be prepared for a action packed movie .
i will share this movie with other people . so they can buy it and enjoy it too they can play it too .
great classic video set . my family and i sat down and watch these videos and had so much fun just remembering them .
great to keep up with the story line . looking forward to future sets . it is wonderful to follow the life of this boy who is following his dream .
this movie was made along time ago , however its still was a great movie and i really enjoy ed watching it again .
the graphics on this movie are great . the story line kind of weak , but i thought it was ok. i would probably watch again .
i 've never seen this special . very cool to get the chance to see new lucy material ! definitely recommend for any lucy fan .
i watched this movie wanting more from it . i dont like the nasty words all the time . i would not watch this movie again

love this show . intelligent and engaging plots , great character development , good chemistry between actors . i own the first season and now the second and look forward to owning the third and every one to follow .
one of the best love stories i 've seen . this one really goes to the heart . great actors . not much i would change about this movie .
i seriously could n't get enough of this entire series ! everything about it is simply awesome ! the actors are not only gorgeous , but the setting and costume is simply the best !
i have been looking for this movie for about two years now and i am glad that i found it here , thank you all so very much ... ...
prince can really make a movie , ca n't he ? ? ! ! ! great movie , great music which leads you into the cd purchases ! ! thanks
such a great movie . great performances by hugh grant and emma thompson . i absolutely recommend you see it if you have n't already .
if you like jane austin and indian movie it is very hart warming and good performance by good actors , good songs ,
these stories are timeless for interest , content and lessons . i wish there were more sci-fi writers like this today and in the future .
a classic that we watch every thanksgiving . five stars belongs to `` a charlie brown christmas '' and this does not come near the quality , so only four stars .
dvd arrived quickly and in good condition . have n't seen this movie in a long time so it was fun to watch again !
this movie is very cute . of course , typical of disney , someone has to die , but in the end everything comes out well .
absolutely love this series ! even better than the original in my opinion ! great action and comedy mix . as well as an amazing plot .
do n't need to say much if you know this movie . it is what it is , has it all , great story , great characters , great messages .
a good story line and animation . a nice family movie , if families every see movies together anymore , that is . it would be nice to think so .
saw it the other day on tv had to get it funny and goofy ... jason lee plays a great bad good boyfriend hillarious
i love this series and so does my daughter . she is collecting all the seasons . she enjoys watching them over and over again .
this movie is not what you would expect , it has action , heart , comedy and horror rolled all in to one , well done story-line that is a pleasure to what ...
this was a very good show , had wished it lasted many more seasons . am still very glad that they put the one and only season on a dvd .
no one makes movies anymore like hitchcock did . if you like his movies than this is a must have . good quality and good movies in this collection .
we enjoyed the movies - but did not get to see all of them . since we have very little time to sit and watch tv , it will take a while till we see all the movies .
i love this movie . i watch this soooo many time when my girls were teenage . i still watch now to get some good laughs .
the moral of the story is that when you talk to someone they are n't really listening if you are talking at them and are n't listening back . fun to watch more than once .
the acting was ok. i watched it the first time . felt like i wasted my time . to slow for me . i would not buy this dvd if i had known it was not very good
that how it came just okay , the sound was good , but the video was poor . to bad i love danny kaye . art
this was ordered as a gift . arrived on time , they loved it ! really dont have anything else to say about it !
this is a wonderful movie , betty white plays a out standing part as a lady on a mission to cross the country
when will season two vol 2 come out on dvd ? almost a year now and if these are consistently being release in volumes then it will take forever for the rest of the seasons to be available .
i enjoy watching these series of movies back to back . i have watched them at least 22 times just because , buy this you 'll love it .
melissa mccarthy was outstanding ! as a guy i did n't think i 'd like this movie , but it was so down right funny ! awesome movie .
this is brilliant gritty british tv at its best . every one in the series is excellent , i thoroughly recommend it to anyone who enjoys great acting ( helen mirren is fantastic ) and strong story lines .
these episodes are hilarious ! i 'm so glad they are available on dvd -- i would never have been able to see them otherwise .
very good series . i have seen all of them after watching morse and would watch more but it is all done
i did n't know if i was going to like it cause of all the bad reviews but it turned out okay .
very , very slow . i 'm afraid we lost interest and stopped watching about half way through . we were expecting better character development .
this is one of those movies that keeps working for days after you have watched it . it is sweet , thought provoking , enlightening and everybody grows .
great movie and so glad to have it in my collection . as great today as when it came out the first time .
this is a good fun action flick for the whole family . i went in to the movie not knowing much about the series but enjoyed the movie none the less .
i was very pleased with my purchase . i did expect the movie to be more bloody , by the way it was described on the back . i did enjoy the movie .
brings me back to when my kids were just starting to get into & # 34 ; music & # 34 ; - this was one of the favorite dance and music movies -- - brings back terrific memories ...
i gave this dvd 3 stars because it 's not as good as the television series . but it 's still good for die hard fans .
my son tried to get me to start watching this for months . i finally did , and was hooked ! ! the writing , the acting is amazing . i highly recommend this series .
it 's a good movie . maureen o'hara was so young ! story is good and the colors are wonderful ! if you like pirates movies you 'll like it no doubt !
the alien invasion is a good premise . i look forward to season 3. some of the acting and dialogue could be better .
very creative packaging of a great series , if you know someone who enjoyed this series they will definitely like this gift !
nice to watch an old favorite of mine in brilliant color ... .the bible is better , but this blue ray movie is a close second .
not as good as the first die hard . a ok story line . but , there is plenty of action . if you like action . this a good one for it .
i remember watching this movie in my teens that i just laugh so much with this movie . i had to have it .
i was so glad to get these as i had missed them first time around . now i can see them more than once and enjoy them all over again .
got this for a really great price , and it arrived quickly . i watched it and it was in perfect condition . i am happy with this purchase .
i have always loved nicolas cage and this was a good movie . it is not his best but it is worth watching .
i just could not get into this movie . it was slow and i was disappointed because i love julia roberts .
lots of jokes that adults will get that the kids might not . makes for a very good family friendly movie night .
great movies . as usual the sequels are not nearly as good as the original . but funny none the less . buy them !
was good and sad . the poor boy had no real friends but his dog that he loved more than anything . then its gone . enough watch and find out .
great movies series . never thought i was a superhero watching person , but i find myself loving these type of movies .
although i love and appreciate daniel day lewis and his talents , i did not enjoy this movie at all because it is dark and weird . i gave it to my library !
this movie introduced me to great music i do n't know how i had missed and a great story . i thought is was well done and enjoyed it . thank you .
enjoyed the movie would reccomend it for anyone who is looking to buy a good movie . would watch the movie again .
i have always been a huge fan of dexter and this final season collection does not disappoint ! i highly recommend !
i love this movie . this is one of the great movies . it has actors in it . i have seen it more than once .
we really enjoy this show , so this was the perfect birthday gift for my husband . we really enjoy the characters and the story line .
i remember these movies from the old days and loved them then and love them now . thank you very much .
i really like old movies and this one did not disappoint . it was a double winner for me because it was base on a awesome piece of history . loved it
how can they still put on such a great show . omg they are the best band in history , lets hope they make it 10 more years
we are fans of this series and a must see if you like the original series and future films coming out a long with wolverine .
downton abbey is the best show ever made . it is a great historical novel . we love it but season three is not as captivating as the others . it is a bit of a let down .
i really likes this one because it was a good show and i miss it . i would recommend this to anyone
though i just love the original black & white movie , i do like this one , too . good to have both !
i liked it . but i thought they could have added more to make it more exciting . in my opinion leo could have done better
if you liked road trip and american pie you will like this one . very funny and some out of hand humor .
i 've always enjoyed this movie and i 'm very pleased to have found it at a reasonable price after looking for it for many years .
we do n't all get the chance to go back and see how our life could be different . even so the movie lets you know there is always time to change and let god do his work .
the vhs was delivered promptly and in good condition . the movie itself was not very good . boring .
my husband loved this series growing up and it stands the test of time . excellent writing and acting . wish there was more to watch .
the price was a little bit much , but its such a great movie i could n't pass it up . buy it ! ! ! !
fair movie for a remake . it seemed to take an extra long time getting to the action though . i appreciated that it was pg-13 so that i could watch it with my son .
i choose this rating because of stars & how well they played their part . excellent , i love a good movie
my daughter saw it and said mom you have to see it . it was very good . actors were good too the ending was a surprise but enjoyable . i would watch it again .
special effects were great and enjoyed the action scenes . i did not fall asleep during the movie . nice spin on a old story
i love learning about morse and what created him to act the way he does . i like this series better than the morse series .
for me the best picture is the first one , the other missed the magic of the first , but i had to complete the saga
i found is enjoyable and with enough twists to make it flow to the end . matthew is convincing in the part .
each season gets better and better . if you have seasons 1 and 2 , you 'll have to get season 3. as always , it keeps you guessing .
just did n't get the point of this movie if there was one ! there was no plot or point !
i almost gave up on this about half way through but it did get better the longer i watched it .
watching this movie , you will be happy to know that christopher nolan saved the best for last . christian bale is solid again as batman , but anne hathaway steals the show followed by closely by tom hardy .
remake of the old tv series , entertaining , but nothing close to the original series .
my wife grew up watching old classics and she loves it . i 've seen older movies that i like better , but it was worth watching .
no real discovery on the son 's part did dad really need to be in the movie ? i do n't think so
bill murray at his best . do n't miss it . funny and serious at the same time . i loved this movie and so did my husband .
awesome family movie .. saw this many times .. many many times .. great music .. great memories . a real feel good movie .. good for the whole family ..
i ca n't say enough good things about this film . it has magnificent . i have watched it many times and never get tired of it . one of the best ! ! ! ! !
you just keep thinking about this movie after you see it , then you see it again . my wife was n't that into it , but i was .
a favorite christmas movie of mine for many years . so glad to have this for my christmas movie collection . thank you !
this show made clint walker a name in hollywood and it 's an excellent western though too bad it 's b & w .
i heard about this movie in one of my criminal justice classes . it was actually really great ! i think it is a must see for everyone for sure . very interesting .
downton abby is worth watching more than once . if you have made it through seasons 1 and 2 you already know this .
thought the movie was funny and comical and the dvd was in decent condition when it was sent to me .
this movie is great , working in an office this movie really makes me laugh more than some . and for the steal of the price i got i had to add this to my collection .
suspenseful , funny , serious , great story , acting - lots of twists and turns , even though you already know the outcome , highly recommended .
loved the story . fun to watch . we own many animated films ( no kids in our house ) . this is one series i 'm sure we 'll end up buying to see it again and again .
i like this movie . i think they did a pretty good job for back in those day 's . this is a movie that i believe everyone should give it a chance .
what a weird campy little movie . not for everyone but i enjoyed this movie . your either going to like it or your not .
this movie was a very good movie i saw this movie when i was a kid and always liked it .
pop the popcorn , sit back and enjoy the dvds , well worth the buy and time to see , you will love them , i always have ! !
a great performance by a great band . they still have it . a must see concert by a must see band ! ! !
always a good classic to rewatch . we used to own the movie.. not sure where it went . thanks for having it available
this is one of the most boring films i 've seen in a while ! it 's very stupid too . i ca n't believe it was nominated for an academy award . i mean really , come on !
this was the last dvd in the james bond series my husband need to complete his collection so he was so happy to find it ! he watched it right away ! thanks !
there 's nothing like the old cast to bring a smile to your face . if you ca n't get enough of the duke boys , than this is for you
i was n't quite sure what to expect but the movie kept me entertained . if you are looking for something to busy for an evening give it a shot if nothing else is available .
it was okay ... but i think it was a bit cheesy in some parts . it could have been way better . the cast and script are just ok .
this is one of the most delightful animations to come along lately . i would recommend it for both young and old .
i got this for my husband & he just loves it & all his other cowboy movies . very enjoyable , will watch it again & again . the scenery is awesome .
i love johnny depp but not in this particular movie which is basically unforgettable from beginning to end . try again johnny
i had seen this a long time ago , but could n't remember it . stayed up late one night renting it from amazon and enjoyed it again very much .
a huge family favorite . this is a show our entire family enjoy watching . love the quirky characters . looking forward to the next season
this is such a wholesome movie , with a great storyline , and great characters . very good for the whole family to enjoy .
a fairly good rendition of this agatha christie classic . i 've enjoyed ( i believe ) all the various versions and this was a pretty good one .
i bought this for one of my brothers as a birthday present . i have lost count how many times we watched it . all the discs were worked fine .
this movie was wonderful ! ! ! clint eastwood and meryl streep were outstanding in their roles ... truly a classic love story ! ! ! loved it ! !
omg i loved this movie from the first time i seen it years ago in middle school . i loved the quality of the picture and sound . it really was better then expected .
this was a good movie . i do n't know if i really like tyler perry 's acting on this movie but the movie over all has a great plot .
this is perfect for horror fans that love bad movies . who really does n't enjoy this stuff ? well worth the money paid for it !
went in with low expectations . it was much much better than i expected . great story line . was pleasantly surprised and would recommend watching .
excellent dvd . would recommend it for children , or adults . price was acceptable , as was the delivery time . will order additional dvds at a later time . i will recommend this dvd to others .
one of the best shows on tv . if you have n't seen it then buy this and you will be hooked !
i have thrown away alot of money on movies that seem to think it is not good unless it is r rated in some way . this is a good movie . try it .

this movie is artistic and depicts what life is like in peoples heads when the world is n't perfect because its not !
the best thing about this set is the cover picture . i found the stories dated and with little or no scare .
almost a five but they cut all their stories to exactly 100 minutes and sometimes leave the story short .

this movie is a great family movie . action that any kid would like but clean . we loved it and recommend it for family viewing .

what 's not to love ? i just wish there were 10 more discs . i could watch steve martin all day . sometimes i do .
this anniversary set is great , you get the blue ray and dvd discs and for the same price as you would pay for one .

good movie . i 'm not a movie critic but i know what i like . a very well acted movie . moving and in many ways disturbing .

i 'm not sure i believe what they say , but the show is very entertaining ! seems to get better with time !

no one is the comic relief that don knotts portrays -- that innocent humor is safe to leave alone with any child . service was good , product as described . do recommend them .
this movie was much better than i thought . i expected it to be a stupid flick , full of stupid sight gags , but it 's a funny movie .
entertaining and fairly realistic ... but we like movies with happier endings . oh wait , then it would n't be like real life ? ? ?
this was just disappointing all round . not much more to say about it . i like rod taylor , and he was good , but the film just never took off .
this is an especially great video , with many of our favorite singers , and we never get tired of watching and singing along . so glad we bought it .
this is like a sherlock and watson with more humor . the fact that this show is a mystery shows in the lead character but with our all the unnecessary violence that appears on current tv . love the cars
stupid stupid stupid . i think it was stupid . and then it got more stupid . and then it ended stupid . awesome .
season 4 should have been the ending . with the exception of the last show . this really did not grab me .
what 's up , doc ? is a part of my growing up i want to share with my grandchildren . just as funny now as they were when i was a kid .
interesting story in that real historical events made fictional actually seemed a little believeable . entertaining movie , well acted , very good special effects . overall , i was entertained .

movie too short . but it is a classic . i enjoyed watching it again but as an adult it was not as interesting to me this time .
i was n't happy with this movie . as a matter of fact it just did n't hold my interest enough to watch it from beginning to end .
my father in law has really enjoyed this dvd . i recommend you purchase this dvd for anyone who loves to watch war movies and documentaries .
creepy , good old horror flick . they just do n't make them like that anymore !

i enjoyed the movie very much . it was funny and had a good moral to the story . right up there with shaun of the dead .

great quality blu ray . loved the cast and story . in spite of what some reviewers ( critics ) said this is a good movie .
this is an oldie but goodie . i first saw it years ago and catch it on tv whenever i happen to see that it is on . i finally decided it was time to own the dvd .
it was a wonderful movie . i would certainly watch it again . i cared about every character . maggie smith always delivers .
i 've always loved this movie . great cast and acting . the extras included with this one are very interesting , also . highly recommend .
good film , kind of slow sometimes , but it keeps a reality to it . shows how people 's lives get strange .
i loved the movie and i love the actors . it was the second part and it was just as good as the first one .
enjoyable sci-fi series that brings a new level to science fiction series , interesting subjects and excellent humor without any over drawn blood and guts , and crappy humor .
deep space nine is a great addition to the star trek universe . a must have for any star trek fan .
even though old , it has been updated by technology and is worth watching again . i will never get tired of this excellent presentation by ken burns .
my daughter loved dora when she was 4. she watched it over and over again .

even when i 'm not a sex and the city fan i must say it was a good movie ! : ) thumbs up ! !
a clever premise for a comedy but paced much too slow . you might need someone to wake you up to find out how it ends .
i thought it was not up to the rest of the tv movies that they have done . it was even kind of silly

my husband and i enjoyed this movie so much the first time we saw it . i finally decided to get a copy of it so that we could get a chuckle whenever we need one .
this is one of the funniest sitcoms yet , because of the true meaning of families today and how diverse they are . it definitely keeps you laughing and i 'm sure to own all seasons !
this is one of the worst chinese flicks i have ever seen and i 've seen most , barely and action and it goes on and on til you just ca n't watch it any more .

this is a great movie . the dvd was just as described by the seller . it arrived very quickly . i would definitely buy from this seller in the future .
i could n't believe the story of this movie . tom cruise and nicole kidman was out of this world with their acting . the scenery went with everything .
decent movie . i do n't care for westerns that much , but these two did pretty good in their roles . worth a look .
loved this series and wished more were made . hated to see it end as i was so addicted to it !
i enjoyed this movie . i read the reviews of others and their thoughts about how it ended , i did not agree . purchase , play and watch you will enjoy .
the 3rd season of castle is as good as the first two season . there are interesting story plots with lots of laughter . if you enjoyed season one and two then you will love season 3 .

this was a good movie with a good plot . i was very pleased with the purchase . i would recommend it

i have blu ray of season 7 to 10 , getting this was awesome . in my opinion this was the best season of smallville . shipped fast just what i wanted .
i would give it a five stars if i could ! i do miss the original characters though . the stories continue to be entertaining .
great action movie made all the better with my favorite action heros all in one movie ! ! i hope expendables 3 will follow ! ! !
i 'm sure that historical accuracy is n't what the director was going for , and that is a good thing . this movie had me on the edge of my seat throughout many parts of it .
nice movie with the sweet judy garland ! ! ! ! ! one of the best actress ever ! ! ! ! ! i like her singing , it 's cute ! ! ! ! !

i have always loved this film , i am a big harrison ford fan this is one of his best . he is a brilliant physical actor as well as emotionally engaged !
one of the best anime series i own . this series is worth every penny i spent .
we have watched this set over and over again . it is just as i remembered as a kid and my son loves it .
it was a funny movie , but obvious that her true love was right next door the entire time . good cast ...
once again i loved this hallmark movie enough to get my own copy . beginning to get quite a collection of hallmark movies !
cute family movie with lots of laughs . pretty predictable but still a lot of fun to watch ! kids will enjoy it too .
while the story may be captivating , this portrayal is n't . not worth the 15 bucks i paid for it . should have rented it .
what can anyone say about the perfect television show ? you could laugh and cry and teach children lessons about life in a 30 minute episode . of course , buy it ! !
my grandson love this dvd he now has all 6 of them in his collection . he loves them watches them over and over again .
my son made me rent this because we lost our dvd of it , and they were reading the book in class
i really love this it was cute and funny i recommend this to people who are fans of bradley cooper
i like this movie . i just need to buy the rest of the collection . it will be awhile before i can though .
this movie has awesome acting & special affects . not meant for kids at all . this will be an exciting trilogy . hope they keep it up .
do n't get it - no life to it . it 's good , but i can name 20 better series out there ... . nothing to write home about
i have always loved the black and white classic movies . this is one of many . enjoyed it and will watch it over again
ultimately , who cares about any of these people ? not enough to know about them to do so . waste of almost 2 hours !
i 've had never heard of this band and now i know why . what 's the appeal ? i do n't like their music .
this is a wonderful good friday tradition . it get better every time we watch it . the whole family looks forward to seeing it .

i have watched this movie several times and really enjoyed it . i will be watching it again in the spring .
i remember almost every one of these movies . i remember everything that i was doing at those times , these bring back so many memories . i miss the 80 's , life was so much simpler .
i had all ready owned this on dvd , when it went on sale as a blu ray , i had to but it
i love this movie has normal humor and my favorite dark humor . the actor just bring you in and make you cheer for bad guys !
drama at it 's finest . you 'll be close to a heart attack by the end of the movie . a very smart drama . it 's very well written . a somewhat original idea for a movie .
i enjoyed watching these old shows again and seeing all the cast in their youth of acting !
this dvd arrived and was well packed . & # 34 ; arthur christmas & # 34 ; is an amazing high quality animation that will be enjoyed by family members .
love this series it 's a great story and i 'm dying for the next season
strange movie of two brothers in france . at some points it is hard to follow while reading the subtitles . but an interesting watch if you want something different .
well worth the buy , evil dead is a great movie , and the movie was a great price , and it came on time
a best series i 've seen in along time . i would recommend anyone to buy this . it 's awesome ! i love it !
we all know how bad things were , but this movie will make you laugh , it will make you cry , and in the end you 'll feel a sense of justice . a really great movie .
this is a very sweet little love story taking place around the holidays . i really enjoyed it , and like the cast .
spend a little time trying to figure what is happening here and you may have a laugh or three . i know i did .
i am watching this show , 11 years later , for the second time . it 's as beautiful , compelling , funny and heartbreaking as i remember . so glad to watch it again !
there are n't a lot of female action stars kate nailed it with this series great story , cast , direction , etc ... very glad to add to library will be doing future business
great for kids of all ages . a little more dark than the old shirley temple version , but still good for kids .
i knew it was old , but it 's kind of corny too . we did n't watch the whole season , just was n't that good for us .
modern day fairy tale love story . very well done acting superb . nice to see feel good movies with no violence !
all musical and ballet dancing it cool love gene kelly . if you enjoy dancing this is the movie for you
if you 're into that type of thing then you will enjoy this film . i however , am not and did not .
i guess i did n't realize the story was written for a 14 year old audience . it was ok , it just was n't as good as i was expecting
i could watch vincent price in house on haunted hill over and over . this ( the legend films version ) is the best . extremely well done .
i enjoy the inspector lewis series and series 3 did not disappoint me . i will order more in the future
did n't think 1 person and some nature could hold my attention as this movie did . richard parker really could have been best supporting actor .
this movie just shocked me on what this man did but very sad but the production was very well done and would definitely recommend this movie to others .
i 've been buying these dvds because i loved the show as a kid . the package is really well done . glad i bought these and i will get season 5 when it comes out .
a very cute and funny movie that i had to have for my library . kids will love it . adults love it too . minions are so cute ! would recommend to all .
we have had this movie in dvd for years . it is quite the fairy tale and a great family film .
loved these movies since i was a kid ! now i have them on bluray ! highly recommend them to any one who loves johnny five !
one of my favorite actresses . what wonderful classic movies . i ; m proud to say i own these . i would recommend this to her fans .
like all larry david episodes . he is a very funny and great comedy writer as well as a comedian for everyone to enjoy
even though im young . i still love the 80 's and 90 's show . i always laugh when watching this . its a funny , corny show , and would recommend it to anyone .
the character actors are wonderful . this movie has an amazing message we all need to hear and live . growing old is hell but this movie points out what a difference our attitude makes .
i love christmas time ! yet another good movie to warm the heart during the holidays !
just do some look over some others and you will find around three more of this nature of better value , though unfortunately for some reason not rated as highly even though as good or better
this is a great show . good story lines , characters , acting and scenery . hope they keep making it for a long time !
the movie was n't for me to view so i ca n't give you much of an answer . my husband loves this movie
i remember the first time i saw this movie . i actually did n't think i was going to like it . i kept watching and can say i thoroughly enjoyed it . great for the family .
true to memory these videos are short , educational , and entertaining . the dvd contains all the videos , even if the previews make the production of the dvd seem dated .
debbie does a lot of singing it in this flick . the story is n't too bad - kinda cute . it 's good family entertainment . i recommend it as being worth watching .
it was a solid story about family and love . it was everything the tv series ( 1st season ) was along with good acting , directing and story . a great family movie .
i did n't watch it but was told it was a persons favorite so got it as a gift for that person .
this is a really good christmas movie . different from most of them . it 's nice to see henry winkler in movies .
i would have to say this is one of the favorite movies . it really is awesome .
i had a lot of expectations for this movie , they were not met at all . another waste of time for me .
my husband and i use to watch this show every week , we love it ! ca n't wait for the next season !
classic . i 'm a big sandler fan but this is his true best . a funny funny movie .
wonderful old movie ... why do they not make them like this anymore ... we really enjoyed watching this again
just an all around awesome movie ! ! i love it . the kids love it we have watched it several times now with out getting tired of it lol .
this is a very good movie , i love anything with dean martin , he gives a great performance in it . i was very pleased with the prompt service and good quality .
this is a fun box set . i received it as a gift and the whole family enjoys it , even the kids .
what can you say about getting 50 movies in the pack with the price being pretty low . the quality is not great what is good . great for any collector .
i love this film and have watched it several times . the purchase arrived ahead of schedule and the quality and price were excellent .
same vampire concept but with & # 34 ; future old & # 34 ; twist . buy it you 'll like it . short but sweet with a good ending .
my family loves this show . you never know what sherlock and watson are going to get into and then you are not sure how they will get out of it alive .
this movie was so awful that i 'm not even going to waste time writing a review about it . just take my advice ... do n't waste your money on this piece of junk !
really a good meeting . not expecting such a strong story line . it was n't oscar worthy , however , its a mark wahlberg
how can you go wrong with this ? it 's the first show in years that has been refreshing and new in plots and scenery . great item to purchase !
i wanted to like this a lot more than i could . it was hard to follow the film . i liked the premise , the actors and the cinematography .
it was a waste of time and money . it 's the film that you get the best scenes from the trailer .
my family enjoy going through all nine seasons of which we have now . we find it is really funny and sometimes an example of what not to do . product arrived in good condition and on time .
tom selleck is great in any thing he attempts . tv , movies , he 's a class act ! if you like cowboy movies , you 'll love this !
really cute movie . full of action from the start to the end . ca n't wait for the next one to come out .
a christmas present for the great granddaughters . they love dora but this one seems newer than the regular tv shows . since they love to sing and dance , they will love this i 'm sure .
fun movie . enjoyed it but not something i would watch again . excellent cast . good photography . a bit & # 34 ; overdone & # 34 ; for my taste .
clint eastwood always seems to make a great film . hope he stays at it for a long time to come
what more can i say ? this movie may be campy but it is good comedic fun . bruce campbell does n't disappoint . i highly recommend this movie .
i bought this dvd because the price was good . i could not get it for cheaper anywhere else . it was received very timely .
i know this movies got great reviews but i just do n't get it . it 's a ok movie but not great at all . did i miss something ?
if you like superman this is probably already in your collection . if not , you 're probably just holding out for a better price ? regardless it 's a good movie for it 's type .
this has been my favorite comedy show ever . the dvds and the case are in a good condition even after a while .
i loved this movie . not only was it very entertaining but it was n't loaded with bad language as many are . i ca n't wait to see red 2 !
it was n't as good as i thought it was going to be compared to the others but in time the series normally does n't die down and is n't as good ! !
i enjoyed the mental break watching this silly movie . will smith and tommy lee jones are great together in this sci-fi flick .
the music is bad , batman is stupid , the film is very very bad .
pretty okay . dialog could have been a little less contrived , but overall it 's an entertaining movie . worth a watch . yep .
we have these fights still and i for one would want the african american on my side i truly do n't see color
it was go good to see this again , as i had forgot some of the episodes . wish they had more shows like this now . i would recommend this if your a star trek fan .
cute story , nice acting . enjoyed it very much and will probably watch again in the near future . this type of movie is always great to relax by .
a fun movie musical all done with kids . i saw this as a kid and loved it 's hard to fine . family friendly for the kids pop some corn and have a fun night .
this is my second time watching this season . i love the sg-1 stargate series . i find the characters and stories intriguing and very well done . you never know what will happen next .
love you whitney : ) this movie was great . there was great acting . loved every minute .
good movie but have you ever seen a bad movie with & # 34 ; the rock & # 34 ; in it . i am a female and i would watch it again .
thought this movie had a good twist for a scary movie . was nothing like i expected which was a pleasant surprise .
wonderfully funny , and every bit as good as the first one . this is one sequel i can honestly say is worth watching !
this is a great great movie.. my mom and i sat down and have watched this movie a dozen times .
not academy award performances , but was something i watched as a child . if you watched shows like buck rogers , then this is about the same quality . enjoy ! ! !
laughed so hard ! this is the first madea movie i 've seen . loved it ! especially her scenes with the children . i 'll watch more !
this is for my collection for when i go cable free soon ... i ca n't wait to go cable free i like to choose what i watch and when i watch and i love the pause .
good movie . i do not mind sub titles , so this one was up my alley . good acting for a foreign movie with a decent story line .
came fast in good shape . love disaster movies but have not had time to watch this one
this movie is soo adorable , very cute ! i highly recommend for any young child or adult ! very cute movie ! : )
this package arrived early and was a surprise for someone who is a fan of the movie . he was excited .
all i can say is this band is the standard by which i judge all others .
cool movie , good story and characters and i love the music . i felt like the female character was me . love this movie
i ordered this because i wanted a copy of the second season . i have n't watched it yet . if when i watch it there is a problem with the dvds amazon will replace it .
very interesting movies in the way that it can go back in time to see what has happened to figure out a crime , very well done
everyone should see this one or have it in your library ! it 's nice for the kids and adults . get it
very entertaining show with lots of little lessons contained here . characters draw you in and make you care . i really enjoy watching this show !
delightful movie with beautiful scenery . have been a fan since it came out several years ago on the big screen .
loved this show as a kid . and it 's still alot of fun to watch . man it brings back a great deal of memories .
i just could n't get enough . loved it . waiting for season two . very very riveting , constantly keeps you on edge wanting more and more .
that show was so touching to me and it was wonderful and great and i love it very much it is great .
i love british television shows , but usually stick with dramas . however , i came across this show and after one episode i was hooked !
i loved this movie as i did with all the other pbs ones . they are a joy to watch any time .
great movies , have added them to our move library . we just love these old time movies . back then there was little special effects and true acting . recommend to everyone .
fun movie and pretty funny ! enjoyed it very much ! there is a lot going on in the movie and johnny depp acting was top notch ! ! !
i really was expecting something much better but this was still good though i would 've enjoyed something a little more exciting though
this i have loved forever . the colors and costumes and the music are wonderful !
i would recommend this movie to ww2 movie buffs . it also has big name stars , wayne , and the like , well made
it was okay . pretty boring n not really worth the $ 5 rental price . it 's def not a movie i would rent again .
this was n't as funny as his other stand up comedies but it was still pretty funny . i would recommend it .
this movie is absolutely hilarious . it has great music with a lot of comedy and fun . one of the best movies i have seen in quite some time .
full of quirky characters these shows are a lot of fun . they kept me watching just to see what emotional disaster would happen next .
i liked this movie . it did have flaws . very many flaws . it was fun and cool otherwise .
one of the first five films he starred in which are clearly the best a great film for 80s action fans
great show . i ca n't wait until they release season 5. the producers captured a time that has long since past .
one of the all time enjoyable films . great acting and cool story . i enjoy watching it again and again . delivery was fast and complete .
i did n't like it at all brad pitt looked old and the zombies were gross and stupid book was soo much better how could they get it so bad
this movie received fantastic ratings and i cant figure out why . the two main characters carry on a dialog throughout the entire movie with no real purpose .
this is a good story about a woman 's life and what she goes through . it will keep you interested , especially about her love life !
when i got the move i could not wait to watch it . it was like the same old thing over and over and became very boring
i love it i love it i love it , i recommend everyone to own it i have watched it many time on my netflix account but decided to buy my own copy .
who would keep having children just so that they might be killed for sport ? this was very boring . glad i did not waste money to see in the movie house .
this definitely built on the matt damon character , and presented a likeable character in the latest adventure . car chase and he got the girl , what else could you want ?
dated movie that was not hardly entertaining . if you are bored and have nothing else to do you might want to watch this movie .
loved the first one , but this one really fell below par . i had expected a whole lot more , based on what i had read from critics .
i could n't watch this movie and not think of the matrix . very similar , but different as well . i may need to rewatch to really understand the ending .
my daughter and i love this show . it has such a good heartwarming story that the whole family can enjoy .
i am very happy with this purchase & i recommend it highly . if your already a fan , then you know why . check him out on youtube and you will too .
i have always enjoyed this movie so i finally decided to add it to my collection . this original is better than the remake . i love the cast and they give a great performance ! : )
i love this show and i could not think of a better way than to see it when ever i want to .
this is still as much fun to watch as it was when it was first released . in some ways it reminds me of the hitchcock movie the trouble with harry .
grew up watching this series in the 60s , was both entertaining and educational . sadly , shows an american culture that is all but gone today .
a very fun movie . great photography through out the film . good action with a great adventure story to go with it . i highly recommend this film to anyone .
i watch this every year at thanksgiving . its a fun movie about what really matters in life . i bought my sister a copy this year .
this is a great children movie . it has a great storyline and . i recommend this movie for all children .
all four seasons of this series is great , they do not make westerns like this anymore and the color episodes are nice
if you 're looking for family fun , this is a good movie to pick . it 's hilarious for all ages . and you do n't have to worry about it being inappropriate .
the movie is great . i love it , and it came just as described . there were no flaws with it . i was pleased .
just a so so movie but had a better ending than i thought was coming . the main characters were strongly played .
very intense movie with great acting . enjoyed the photography , the story line and the two actors who make the movie . redemption story
most of the super man movies like segal movies where he never can be hurt or loose i do not care for . jason statham for some reason are more entertaining . maybe better acting , who knows .
my sister loved receiving this movie when i gave it to her with others for christmas . i will certainly be ordering more for her in the future of this type from amazon .
it 's got some high points but it definitely fails to meet the level of fun the first movie had . just trying to go over the top too much
it is very good and cute movie , kids like it and dvd is good condition . thank you and have a good day !
i do n't want to spoil the movie but roy did a superb job in the powerful film about personal redemption and forgiveness of one 's past mistakes .
typical arnold film with lots of action but same theme as usual . it was an ok film to watch at home
i only remember catching the trailer when it first came out , but when i finally saw it i was pleasantly surprised . a little dated , but still lots of fun to watch .
until you have seen this movie , you have no idea . that is all .
good adventure for the entire family . shows the coming of age of a young man , and it was fun to see a father and son movie .
was always a great tv police drama when i was a child . i will watch it all the time ! ! !
m daughter liked it but i was not impressed . the movie had potential to be a great story but fell short by bad acting and unbelievable characters .
what an interesting story and so well done . really gives a lot of insight not only into this family but the history of europe during that time . great ending ! !
ground breaking season one episodes in very nice quality ! i decided to watch them in broadcast order . highly recommend . enjoy .
i got to say that arnold and sylvester play excellent roles in this movie . the plot is great ! this movie is action-packed . the producer has an extraordinary imagination ! this is a must-see .
series moves really fast and can make you tired , but you always have to suspend disbelief . too way out , but fun .
i love old cartoons and this a a terrific collection . the sound is good and picture clearer than expected . thank you amazon prime for making this available for watching free ! !
the watch is a funny movie . i saw it on tv & just had to have it . i recommend this movie .
i gave it this rating because i thought it could have been more intense and exciting . it 's what i call a middle road picture .
it is not a classic but it is still a good movie . actors not very well known but good performance .
another great movie and i was truly impressed with the story line , along with fight scenes . another keeper for my collection .
this was a good show about two guys who hooked up , messed up , and broke up . a little hard to follow but kept a good pace . a good show .
my kids are 6 and 8 now and they just love spongebob . i 'm so glad i have the prime membership so we can watch this season over and over .
this is the kind of movie i love to see ... relatively authentic , good pacing , great costuming , and awesome acting . would love to see more of these type of movies about other historical figures ...
this was an ok film , just not what i expected from a denzel film , i guess i am so use to his action roles . it was ok .
i was a little in shock for the first episode , but i decided to give the rest of the series a chance and got hooked on it !
gave as a gift and it was a treat to watch wonderfull classic movie for us all to share , thanks
good movie that ties in kinda ties in with the first paranormal . interesting feature of spanish characters as the victims of the activity .
tried to watch this film . i really did . but it was so boring and charlie sheen shows again that he ca n't act . i turned it off after watching 30 minutes .
the movie was bit overdone , with quite a lot of gun use . but , with fabulous acting by two aging well grand actors .
this was a blast . loved how the movie moved along . and how things could go really bad very fast in life .
this movie always gives me a chance to laugh . chevy chase has some pretty decent movies out there and this is just one of them .
i am rating the quality of the blu-ray dvd . the blu-ray version is definitely worth buying . visual is great and sound is perfect . spend the money and add this to your collection .
it was a feel good movie and i enjoyed watching every minute . did not expect to like it at first , but it drew me in .
i love to dance and was trying to help my mom get into shape and she is n't so great at dancing and even she loved it .
one of my favorite movies . such an intriguing plot and we 'll developed characters . you really love who you 're supposed to love and you really hate who you 're supposed to hate .
i love the re series , but for me this one sucked . there was not enough zombie action , just slow motion stunts . no real action like in the other movies . i was bored and really disappointed
this reminds me of my childhood , minus all of the commercials . if you like the tv specials but would rather watch it on your own terms , get this !
one of my all time favorite movies and robin williams is great in this role , it is one of those movies that you can watch over and over .
a must for all sam elliot fans who collect his movies . two movie of his that are not as well known as others .
like i have said before that i am a big fan of bleach and can not wait until bleach uncut 18 come out .
if you saw the first one and liked it then you 'll love this one ... .this one had some different twists and was def a little more scary !
this is one good movie for the whole family , especially for your high tech kids if you have any that is ?
i saw this version of zorro when i was a child and fell in love with it . it is one of my favorites !
nothing like the first one . it does n't have the original cast and even though i like the rock this just was n't him movie .
not the greatest movies ever made but it is nice to re-watch them on blu ray and recall an earlier era in movies .
this was a gift for my sister ... she rates it a 5 ... i think it 's a 1 ... but we all have different taste
probably my favorite tv show out there . this is a great addition to add with the first two seasons i already own . well worth it ! !
the music , the story , all of it is fantastic ! the kids watch this over and over , and the adults love it too ! ! ! !
angela lansbury was right on target on this final season . i now have them all and will enjoy seeing them over again .
my grandchildren love this movie ( i do too ) . great purchase . i will purchase more instant videos in the future for sure .
saw this movie the first time in europe , in the mid 80 's , and enjoyed immensely . nice improvement over the vhs copy i still had . would recommend to everyone who enjoys a cult classic .
this is an all time great collection to have it draws you in and never let 's you go a movie for all ages .
my husband use to watch this show as a child and we wanted to show it to our 11 year old .
we loved these old shows growing up , and it is great to be able to re-watch them , especially the christmas episodes , this many years later . corny , but fun !
great action video and special effects ; best i 've seen in a long time . kept one engaged . willis was excellent as usual .
i usually do not rate movies very often but i am such a big fan of bronson and this one is one of my favorites .
i enjoyed getting the entire series at a reasonable price . i stopped watching over the years and was most happy to see a product in one package .
we enjoyed every minute of this movie . it only left us wanting for more ! ! !
this was ordered for my husbands movie collection that is growing and will continue to grow over the next year
i have always been a fan of the pink panther . it is nice to reflect back and watch the original episodes .
just like all the other reviewers , i could wish for a different ending . but for that it would be 5 stars .
watched this with my grandson and we both enjoyed it , very informative , and educational . would watch again even if grandson is not here !
the high school of the dead : complete collection [ blu-ray ] , i very much enjoyed this anime , if you love anime and you love zombies just get it , you wont be disappointed .
i ordered this product for my grand child and she loves it . i 'm very pleased with the manner in which it arrived .
i like the fact that i get the dvd , blu-ray , and you are able to download a digital copy . also , the are some really cool features on both blu ray and dvd .
just plain good fun . heston and brian keith are great together . sit back , enjoy the scenery and the humor and experience a part of western history that did not last all that long .
i have read all of the twilight saga books at least 3 times and i have seen all the movies at least twice . love all of them
another john wayne movie i bought because i love all of his movies . this one is one of my favorites .
i absolutely love this dvd . worth getting if you like the british comedies . great watching !
in keeping with the my `` short and sweet '' title , do n't waste your time or money on this stinker .
great show ! arrived quickly and without any damage , i would definitely recommend if you are a fan of the show .
the twist at the end is great , the whole flick was action-packed ... not able to see through ( all ) of the twists , kept you watching ! !
excellent . this movie made me want to buy mrs. keith other books about her experiences . a classic .
this is not an academy winning film . it is a fun look back at one of burt reynolds films . nothing more nothing less .
love george lopez very talented actor very funny good sense of humor would love to go to one of his show and would recommend this dvd to anybody who has a good sense of humor
really good movie if you enjoy silly . we laughed a lot . even the husband stayed awake for a change and laughed with the rest of us .
i really wish they would make more than 8 episodes every two years ! this is for the entire family and we all enjoy the storyline .
unlike anything i have ever seen ! laugh out loud hilarious ! i love this show ! ! a must see cartoon for anyone with a sense of humor !
this was one of my favorite batman animated movies . great story and a lot of fun . kinda on the dark side . i enjoyed it . bluray looks amazing
both my husband and i live this movie . it is great , we wish that we could have gotten the uncut version but i guess we have to buy the regular dvd !
this film was recommended to me and i was not disappointed . it will hold your interest all through the film .
awesome movie as were all the twilight movies . got this movie to try to complete my set and cant wait till breaking dawn part 2 comes out to buy it
absolutely love this movie . the quality and sound was excellent . i recommend this movie . it was really funny . richard pryor was hilarious .
no matter what i always love what i love these movies , it 's so quirky and funny , it makes it a perfect movie to always have around .
i recommend this for any monster high fan . my little sister very much enjoyed these movies as she is a monster high fanatic .
i must admit this movie had me laughing the entire time . i bought the movie just because of jeremy renner , but was pleased with the movie . it will def give you a laugh .
this is one very fine western with the best western star of today sam elliot , great story , and beautifully filmed . plus you ca n't beat the price .
a quiet little drama . michael kitchen 's understated acting sets the tone for the show that does n't hit you hit you over the head . a fine cast with good scripts . well worth watching .
there were a few cute spots in the movie but a little on the slow side . the concept was unbelievable .
love this show , i was very glad it came out on dvd . thanks amazon for having it in stock .
this movie was a very pleasant surprise , that far exceeded my expectations ! the characters are fabulous , the storyline very engaging , and went from very funny to incredibly inspiring in a moment . i loved it !

my wife and i thoroughly enjoyed the lone ranger . as usual , johnny depp was very entertaining . i definitely recommend it .
this drama is one of my favorites , thank you i really enjoy it , i like the fact that the product is brand new , also the subtitles are very good
diamond head dvd with charlton heston is a great video and if you like charlton heston , you will like this movie .
i love scifi so was happy to add 'the island ' to my collection . cast is great and story is n't complicated for confusing .
it would be good if they would slow it down a bit . it 's hard to keep up with them . i guess it 's meant for younger people .
i had seen this made for tv movie many years ago and was glad to see it was available on dvd . i enjoyed it .
a story about a boy and his dog ( s ) . very heart warming . an ideal family show which will have you in tears . recommended all the way .
this is my husband 's favorite movie . it takes him back to a simpler time when he did not have to worry about the world . we both love it .
the second season is just as great as the first . all the characters are still hilarious . do n't miss out on the fun !
bought this for my bother . great gift for someone who likes a little bit of sci-fi with their comedy . i own it as well and never get tired of watching it .

the kids love all the tom $ jerry dvd 's . this one was no exception . they nearly have their collection complete ! thanks amazon !
the special effects are awesome and the plot is fun . hd is the way to go when viewing a movie such as this .
this was one of the movie collection of x-men and to complete what i had even though the other movies were on vhs ; i wanted this movie .
great action martial arts film . great fight scene good storyline easy to follow . this dvd is a must for martial arts collectors to have in their collections

i loved this movie as a kid its so well done its hard to believe it was made so long ago i recommend this for your family and your children its a great movie : )
i bought this as a gift - the recipient loved it . thinking about buying for another friend that likes jeff .
one i 'm going to have to buy after seeing and loving this movie- humorous and made me jump in places . just loved it .
the ice man knows his stuff . i could just sit back and watch this over and over again . this is when music was really music ,
i ordered a few of these because it 's a wonderful continuing story of friendship , family , and romance . it is a comedy too as well as a drama . worth purchasing !
i choose this movie because the storyline was intriguing . i purchased it when the price offer was less than $ 4 . it turn out to be more than worth the purchase price .
it wo n't play in region one . did not return it for a refund . this is the second time this has happened .
i gave this away as a gift and they person loves it . it came on time and no damage to the package .
this is one of stephen kings best works . it 's a great movie to watch with your older child . if you do not wish for your child to have nightmares , wait until they are 10 .
save your time and money . this movie is all about saying the `` f '' word 2000 times , along with a lot of bad people and aliens . disgusting ! !
remembering this show from when it first aired . so i wanted to see again . better than the movie . like to watch on trips .
rich and interesting . i really enjoyed this documentary , especially the spiritual history . this film makes me want to travel to india so that i can experience it for myself .
well acted , very interesting characters , excellent story line . i enjoyed season one very much and intend to watch more seasons .
joe and steve play almost the same . eric has so much talent . i only wish i could hear more eric johnson !
i loved this show when i was a kid and now my daughter loves it !
this is a classic with a great cast ! ! picture and sound fair but worth seeing again ! if you love the 50 's shows you will enjoy !
so glad we purchased this on dvd . i loved it when we had the vhs tape , but when the player quit we decided we needed to purchase the dvd .
love this movie , it is hard to find and amazon has always been my go to place to find things like this .
this is a terrific series and will bring back memories of the 50s for those old enough to remember . the stories are warm and acting is extremely good -- ca n't wait for series 2 in 2013 .
love having the dvd in the series . it 's fun and i love the way michelle moves . fun and campy . great .
this movie is as enjoyable when i first watched it and it still holds up well . wonderful cast and great direction and good pacing of story is movie magic .
i love these movies , especially the holiday ones . this one is cute as a button . i recommend it for young and old alike .
i am giving this movie 5 stars because it has good biblical and life morals to it . it also is especially helpful if your marriage is in trouble , i would recommend this to any couple out there .
we missed a lot of this the first time around , so now thanks to amazon we can watch the complete series
good movie but not very funny like you might think since he is a comedian actor . most of his movies are like that though .
i love this film - it is great to see in glorious black and white - but it is also very enjoyable in color - if you love 50s science fiction - you 'll love this dvd , larry
i like this movie because im a fan of superman i would recommend this movie to my family and friends
it was a cute movie but not nearly as good as the first one . however , sandra bullock is a joy to watch regardless of the material she is given to work with .
if you like raunchy , stupid funny , this is the movie for you . i like funny , and stupid funny , but this is not one for the whole family .
very boring , lousy acting , just overall a not good buy i cant even give this away it sucks so bad
i really enjoy watching this movie over and over again ! its a great sequel ! it 's definitely on my top 10 movies !
could watch it more than once , and still enjoy it . this is the fourth time viewing the movie ; i can see watching it four more times .
i recommend this movie for all families ! a walk in my shoes movie is great ! please watch is now ! i known this movie for families and its really good !
it 's a wonderful movie that 's still relevant today . you ca n't always go home but sometimes every once in a while you can & everything works out just fine in the end .
liked this movie thanks for getting to me fast . would use this seller again
love this one ! they do n't make this type of animation anymore . : ( very sweet story .
i really like this movie . it definitely gives you something to talk about . it proved to be a little weird for friends , but i liked it .
my wife 's mother loved this one so much we bought her the dvd . now she can watch it as often as she wants ... putting a smile on her face .
this movie was very entertaining for both adults and kids . i 'm looking forward to the follow up movie when i get time to go out and buy it .
i was n't sure what to expect from this movie . i had a lot of friends that said they loved it and after watching it i would have to agree with them .
thought it was a good anime if just a bit short . i believe they could have made another season of it given the storyline . overall good and would recommend it to most people .
i consider this a must in my collection with many named stars . good story set in ww2 behind the main fighting lines . james cagney is the quirky captain and jack lemmon 's comedy is great .
i did n't know about the foreign film number 2 issue and ca n't play this on my players .
no digitally remastered but it brought back the childhood memories just like i wanted it to ! it was definitely worth the money .
lots of extras and episode intro by lucy 's daughter and excellent picture quality and a good buy for the money
they are learning a great deal , wow they can really turn it on and make you jump up and keep you in it .
this series is always fun to watch . it 's too bad it did n't have more seasons . the movie is a must also .
terrific film ! my son and i are collecting japanese film and art and this fits nicely into our collection .
this is such a fun movie ! i really love the humor and wit along with the slapstick comedy . katherine a cary at thier best . an all time favorite .
not one of the great movies , but it is a fun movie for those who enjoy mysteries as well as those that enjoy comedies .
i love this show and i laughed my butt off . this show is so well put together . the deleted scenes on the dvds are awesome .
this movie does n't suck . it 's certainly not the best of the original series movies , nor is it a particularly good movie . it 's still an ok movie though .
this movie is bad ass period ! ice cube rocks his role every time on this bad ass movie ! everybody should have this movie in your collection !
came in a little later than expected but it was in perfect condition , i have no complaints other than receiving time , perfect condition though so in the end that is what really matters i really appreciate it !
i have always been a big fan of these types of movies and would highly say you must buy this film if your into these kind of movies .
this movie is worth renting to watch . the story line is old , but the special effects make up for the rest .
you love action movies ? this is a great one to watch ! it 's full of drama and stunts . it 's also very scary if something like this was to happen !
i expected more action , but loved the actors in this movie ( both are favorites of mine ) but it did drag a little . but ... ... worth watching for a slow evening .
i 'm not a big owen wilson fan , but this is amazing . i love it . great photography too .
my son and i really enjoy this series . i have them all now . for the indiana jones lover you well like this also
this a really good film for all the family . great animation , well written , good actors . this one is a classic .
ron white is one of the best comedians around and this dvd is no exception ! well done with great comedians .
not many deleted scenes ... no extra gore ... nothing much in directors cut of interest over the original release sorry not that good
it 's john wayne for goodness sake . what 's not to love about watching the duke in one of his greatest films .
i have been waiting for this movie to come out on blu-ray for a long time . movie played in great quality and i am happy with this purchase .
wonderful picture . two great actors . to rate a good picture , you do not need a lot of words . you either like it or you do n't .
wish i had known there was an extended version , i would have gotten it . i like the ideas the artists came up with in this movie . quite challenging .
i like the two together in shows because both men are funny and compliment each other very we 'll . good to watch with company or to laugh alone .
yes , it is somewhat like alien but there are many more horrors and a decent cast involved in this . fun stuff .
there are like three or four stories going on in this season but what i love about this show is they do n't lose you .
this movie is very slow starting and almost half way through it too . based in the 70 's if i remember right .
one of the last good series on tv . as usual the early seasons were the best and they are the ones i recommend
there is a lot action in this movie . but it was better than the first !
i fell in love with this movie years ago because of the dance . not much of a movie plot , but still an enjoyable flick .
good movie glad to have it it it watched it several times good good good very well done good good
movie is very good , full of adventure and one of my grandchildren 's favorites . arrived quickly and as described in ad .
i love this movie and feel the actors really bring the story to life ! they all have great chemistry and work really well together .
i heard from a lot of people what a great and funny movie this was . i guess maybe i do n't have the same sense of humor as they do . it was an ok movie for me .
this was a very good sequel and depicted well from the book . i can not wait for the next two movies .
i lost my copy and was happy to find another . so happy i bought two . one for myself and one as a gift .
this is my favorite in the friday movies , so i 'm enjoying this -- everything was great - and i 'm a happy customer !
love a good series this is season 5 and there are more to watch plus colin farrell in a tv series is a bonus
like it but they needed to ad more color to the movie good clear dvd but it needs more color movie is great arrived on time
i used to watch this movie when i was growing up because i was such a big julie andrews fan . it still makes me laugh just as much today as it did back then ! ! !
the first movie is fabulous but the other 2 are a waste of time . paul walker is n't in them and i do n't know why they were even made .
the main character is really talented to play so many characters . the writing is great . this is a very boring review but now i have used up enough words to give it a good one . ; )
not bad but not great either but since its free on amazon prime hard to complain .
this is a great movie and the price was just right for the hd version . the download was a little slow but this is a very long movie . otherwise enjoying my experience with amazon prime !
this was a very good movie- a really sad movie with a lighthearted ending . based on a true story . yes i recommend it , but have some tissues handy .
i believe i now have the entire series if not i will continue to look for the episodes that are missing
are you a james bond movie lover ? if so you will like this one too . lots of action as expected for a bond movie . loved it ... .
have n't seen the last movie yet , but amazon really had this at a phenomenal price ! so i got this collection for my husband for christmas and i 'm sure he 'll be pleased .
more twists , less illness storyline , made this season more enjoyable for me than season one . looking forward to a new adventure
one of the greatest cartoons of all time . all ages will enjoy this and if you 're a fan of batman then this is a must watch .
i remember watching strange days when it was in theaters . i loved it then and still love it . the mix of scifi with who done it makes it a great movie for almost anyone .
its a good zombie movie , good to own and watch , great for a zombie movie collection , but if you had to chose between this one and another one , this one would be my 2nd choice
this is a cute continuation of the first movie . it is funny and the minions are hilarious with all their antics .
this by far is the funniest movie of the year . i laughed so hard , so long , i had to watch it twice .
very cute movie . it was very enjoyable . i like these what if kind of stories . nice clean fun too . okay
what can i say about the mothers in law . a real classic show . a real family show . they do n't make shoes like this any more . a must have .
really enjoyed all the characters and their interactions after a war . well done . long but well worth watching . will not leave you with nightmares !
the movie was pretty good and entertaining but it was obviously made for kids . my wife and i enjoyed the movie and am looking forward to seeing the sequal .
this has been our favorite for many years . to find it all in one package was fantastic . we will have many hours of pleasure .
nice little movie . ok , but not great . i just felt that it could 've been better , but i did enjoy it .
awesome movie for kids of all ages , . the graphics are awesome and the story is good too . my daughter loves this movie and laughs a lot throughout the movie .
fun movie on hbo , need to by because of the attention it got after seeing it , and because everyone was talking about it .
pick this title up . excellent image , incredible sound , original theatrical aspect ratio , and some of the most interesting special features i 've seen in a collectors set in a very long time .
happy to have this to complete my collection . love the movie and am happy to have purchased it here . great
this movie seems like it was going to be a unique movie but i found it to be long and drawn out but never really going anywhere .
great film . much better than the american remake . i highly reccomend it !
one of my old time favorites . so happy to be able to find a copy through amazon . love the old classic films and this was one of the best !
nicolas cage was excellent in this movie and we had been looking forward to seeing it . did not disappoint us .
australian movie and the words are sometimes a bit difficult to understand . but the script is so corny and the outcome so heart-warming . i 've watched it a number of times .
great show and was glad to be able to see it here after missing it on broadcast . ca n't wait for the next seasons
this is an old fashion disney movie . it is okay but lacks clarity and a complete story . the acting is fine for the time it was filmed . i can recommend this movie to the whole family .
clint and morgan played well together . it moved a little slowly , but the acting was decent . too bad there will not be a sequel !
this is a must have for the serious comic book fan ! the animation is crisp and beautiful . the story is intense .
i 'm not much on chic flicks but this one is great . if you have never seen it before you are in for a great movie .
i thought this romantic comedy was cute between drew barrymore & hugh grant . and the music was beautiful ! anyways , i like these two actress and actor .
this was a good movie , and it kept my attention . i bore with movies easily , but not during this one .
i recieved my dvd earlier than expected and it was in fantastic shape . played beautifully . i would definately buy from this seller again .
makes me feel so good by the end , love these feel good movies , and helps get on in perspective ! reese is great in it .
this is one of my favorite episodes . i 'm glad that i purchased it . it was a lot of fun to watch .
what more to say but that the british do so much a better job at putting out quality detective series . one of the best and worth seeing again .
brought back a lot of memories from the 80 's . what a wonderful , clean love story . would watch this again soon .
this is a treasure of a movie to own . it 's quality is exceptional a great find . i 'm very pleased to own this dvd .
this is a movie i look forward to watching every year during the holiday season . it is well made and funny .
season five is full of laughs and fun . exactly what you would expect from one of the funniest comedies of the 80 's .
this was not my kind of film . that is why this rating . you may like it more as the plot is complex .
i use to manage a video store and i use to play this a lot it their because it was fun to watch
lots of action and gore . interesting take on classic story . a nice fantasy . we liked edward . not for young children .
nice collection of superman movies . some are a little dated , but superman is a hero and i like the new movie that was included in this collection as well as the older ones .
how simple the old plots were . it brings back memories when tv as meant to entertain with our foul language and violence .
really , people should make more of these : simple and cheap in making , but with so much that hardly is a cheap movie .
held my interest thanks mr. seagal & austin i 'll be looking for either one of your movies to come out .
this is a classic movie . it is the kind you will want to watch many times as the years go by .
this is a great performance by whitney and shows off her amazing voice ! i would recommend this movie to anyone who loves action movies and great singing !
i enjoy following the quirky characters they are what makes this program such a success . enjoy every season and this was another great season . keep up the good work .
and i liked it . different , kinda hip and acted well . i will very likely watch the rest of the first season and if i continue to like it , all of the shows .
this is a heavy movie . however , the acting and story plot are so good that i have watched it many times . that quality is the reason i purchased the blu-ray version .
this was a great deal . liked the movie and it came with the old one as well . great overall purchase .
always a pleasant surprise . a unique sense of humor . i never miss his movies . at the top of my must see list
what can i say about this season other than you 've got ta have it if you have the other seasons . they are always leaving you guessing on what is next to come .
it passed the time . unable to say it was terrific . not the best , but entertaining . was house bound for awhile and liked the characters .
was home for a visit and this movie came up at my mothers house . she loved this movie , so i ordered it for her !
do n't know how much i paid for it , but it was way way too much ! only bought it because of who starred in it . guess that 'll teach me !
i really love this movie , i 've watched it over and over again . loved it on tv , even better on dvd
love this movie ! i am happy to finally own it . it is very convenient to have in my video library
i saw this and i must say ... ... i like the t & a ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
this was offered at a good price , especially since it was a blue ray package . i 've already viewed it twice .
very educational ! wish they made more in the series of dvds ! we 've got them all !
i kind of liked to watch roseanne for awhile . i still enjoy it . it 's funny the way she acts with her husband and kids .
i love this movie ! it 's very funny . if you like the show then you got ta watch the movie ha ha
i grew up watching this show and when i saw it was on dvd i decided to get it and yes it was worth it and the show is still just as good as it always has been
i have enjoyed the jesse stone series and have continued to add to my personal collection as new ones become available . i enjoy having them to share when i get together with other friends who also enjoy the series
although the acting was excellent , i found the story extremely uninteresting and visually rather boring . i stopped watching after 45 minutes and i doubt that i will ever return to this miniseries .
too goofy at times . would have preferred it follow the storyline of lone ranger more . depp good . hammer sucked . still worth a watch .
i loved this series when i was young and now that i 'm old i love it even more . highly recommend .
nothing bad to say at all here . this movie was awesome . the hulk and thor were incredible . really funny too !
never get tired of watching these great ole ' movies : ) still entertaining and delightful . all that graphic gore is not necessary to enjoy a flick ! ! ! !
i watched this movie and truly enjoyed it while it is violent gritty the acting is well done . i love the movies that are set in the 40 's and 50 's
i bought it as a gift . they loved it and watched it on the first day . it is a must have for any movie collection .
this is one of the best seasons i 've watched of any political show that is on right now . hope the second season is just as good ...
too old for me . the new films are much better but thanks for having this one available for those who want the oldies .
if you love history then this is for you ! ! i love this series ! !
it is a good movie but not up to richard gere standards . story line is flat and not very interesting .
hated it it not my cup of tea i expect two girls to be getting it on and let me just say they dont
i like the movie ive seen it on tv before i wanted it the movie works good and thanks again
the dvd came in the box brand new . it plays very well . james bond movies are my favorite . this is a great movie .
i thought the movie was great ( 5 stars ) without the & # 34 ; real & # 34 ; ending . it dropped a star with the ending . it would have been great without that ending .
i purchased this dvd series for my dad who enjoys watching the reruns of the older shows . he and i watched it together and we really enjoyed it .
i would watch it again , it 's different with some great special effects i think i enjoyed the older version better but these actors more !
i bought this for her as a surprise , she loves the girls in full house , and she loved it , thank you ,
i seen this in the movies and it was really funny to me a little to long but other than that it was good .
i had heard good reviews of this movie . i was not disappointed . this movie has a great plot and wonderful acting .
a good action pack movie and as always washington was great , he is one of my favorite actors so that is it
love the show ; it is dark at times but the humor makes up for it .
great movie i wanted this one for myself . it is done so well and the music by faith hill is wonderful .
a friend of mine told me it was a good movie . i had to see for myself , and he was right . another great movie from denzel washington ! ! watch it ! !
i always want to give richard gere a chance but he rarely comes through as a great character actor or leading man , i do n't know ...
when i purchased this it was placed on my kindle fire . once again , exceptional quality , nothing wrong . even the sound is clear and crisp . excellent buy .
very enjoyable and good quality . it was nice to see the people evolve with their personalities and become more human than the machine .
a fan of classic movies , these are great for a rainy day , or during the winter when it is too cold to go outside .
i watched it today and just laughed . we used to all watch it on cable and i remember a holiday party where we went to a movie theatre and saw it on the big screen .
i happened across this and had to watch . yes , dexter has his cameo . there are some interesting insights as to why morse turned out the way he did .
cool movie , it 's one i just discovered by a random pic at my video store on vhs . watched it many times before the tape broke ...
this is a great movie i have the hole series would recomend every one to watch it
there were some hilarious parts to this movie . there were some dumb ones too . bottom line , its worth watching .
first hour was good while ann hathaway was acting after the first hour its boring , do n't waste your time on this
this is a must have movie for comedy romance viewers . it 's one that never grows old no matter how many times it 's watched .
as always there is a lot of action in all his movies . a little comedy as well always get put in too ! there is a change this time in his role you will be amazed ? ?
it 's funny , i never watched the tv show but i have seen every movie . they are all excellent including this one !
i purchased this movie as it is on of the greatest movies . i enjoy occasionally watching it . thank you much .
i had high hopes for this one as the two main characters are actors i like a lot . this movie had very few laughs and even less interest in it . avoid it and save your money .
i had this as a dvd and wanted it for my kindle fire . it is a cute movie and well worth the cost .
the series is a big joy to me and many others . we talk about it and realize it fits in our lives even now .
beautifully presented double disc set of two streisand classics . a must for all fans and lovers of movie musicals . thoroughly recommended .
this came so fast and i was so happy to have it to complete my collection of the series . awesome
my grandson is very happy with is gift this christmas , he has watched it over and over again so i 'm very happy .
watch this one as a kid and once again i had to share it with my kids . they love it .
great movie . really enjoyed all of the suspense and action that this movie was entirely full of . it was good entertainment !
i loved this , have seen it at least 3 times , above expectation . this is all i can say about this
very pleased with this dvd . this was a used set i bought and every bit as good as a new disc .
wonderful for grandparents to watch with their grandchildren . wonderful for children . the stories are just great and thought provoking for the younger generation .
this movie goes back and shows where it all started . awesome . money well spent . this movie gives you a better understanding of what happened in the past .
is exactly what i wanted a lot of extras just for fans , this kind of classic ! thank you very much
if you have n't watched this gem of a show , get to it right away . tom selleck is outstanding . watch now !
and i watch it year round ! i love this movie ! the actors are some of my favorites and the story is great !
this is a great movie to watch , so good that i watch it a second time . ready to watch for a third time .
what 's not to love about this movie ? it makes me feel good every time i watch it ... ... ...
hard to capture the life of such a fascinating and complex character in a documentary , but burns does as good a job as can be done . and he does so with balance .
love this show ! ! i got the dvds in good time . quality of dvds we good . no complaints . ca n't wait to get the next season .
great season ! one of my favorite seasons and i own the first five seasons of the andy griffith show . i recommend this season !
the fourth installment of the `` mission impossible '' series has got to be the best . the script was excellent , the special effects were superb ! this is a must see !
great movie ! well any movie with george clooney is a great movie in my book . but it has a very good story too .
all ways liked men in black movies . they have all ways been good . this one is good also . keep making them .
i have the others and this one falls in line with the rest but the ending is not what you would expect
at first i thought this was a pretty interesting series but after awhile it seemed to be just ok to just watch to pass the time away
i love this series ! ! amazon is the only place i could find all 3 in one at such a descent price !
i did n't like this at all . i guess i should have read more , i was disappointed that this movie was an adult cartoon .
what can i say , jack , jack , jack ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! sexy as usual ! good and very interesting concept for a movie , enjoyable , see it ... ... .
i went and saw this movie earlier in the day . some parts of the movie were funny , but the rest was a waste of time . please do n't spend your money on such a bad movie .
i am glad its starting a new season soon and series on dvd along with the extra stuff is really nice too
my wife and i have enjoyed all of the programs on each disc . we watch it regularly on pbs and look forward to each cd as they are available
this is truly a great gift for a star trek fan like my husband . he watches it over and over and loves how it is packaged .
great buy , great price fast delivery what more can one ask for ... love the deals for movies , it was cheaper than what i found in stores
good price and fast delivery . this is one of the dvd that keeps your interest all throughout the movie . brilliantly performed and written . bravo to the all who worked to make this movie a treasure .
really enjoyed this one , shows his history at the end of his life . story was good , enjoyed the action in the other two movies with donnie a bit better .
once again , new movie but surely a classic . old or new , watching with the grand kids on a rainy day never gets old !
i purchased two season 1 mash and both the dvd 's skip in the same spot and will not play . poor quality . i also purchased seasons 2 - 5. hope they are not a bad ! !
the movie is brilliant and the young boy cast to play in the film is a remarkable actor . i recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys first rate cinema .
i had read the book before watching it . it 's completely different story . i prefer the book instead of the movie .
a must have for dbz fans i have all 3 seasons thus far ca n't wait for the forth .
this movies is very funny and very entertaining ! it is a good way to spend free time on a friday or saturday night !
i love this movie . kids like it too . it 's funny and has a good plot to watch in family , it came very quickly and great conditions
it had some surprises . it was done from a different perspective that the original . i like most of the actors , but jennifer lawrence is my favorite . she 's already going places .
found footage of la beat cops , doing their job , living life , having romance , and fighting the bad guys . highly recommended .
this was one of my all time favorite scifi tv shows . great crew of actors and great scripts . i 'm so glad they are available on prime video .
picture quality was good but the story line was a little disjointed . wanted it to run a little closer to the tv show .
a very good science fiction movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat .
always loved the movie series and i needed to replace my copy of this title . this one was a perfect replacement since it was the 2 disc edition
it was an enjoyable movie . not great art but fun for group viewing which is how i watched it , at a family birthday party .
i am a grandmother of 3 and i love this movie ... i enjoy watching it alone and with the grandchildren ... .very entertaining ... recommend for all ages ...
movie works wonderfully and kids love it . for some reason i thought it was a four pack but it 's one dvd . picture quality is great . what kid would n't love an under water adventure .
both my husband and i enjoy watching this dvd . we enjoyed watching this series about anne 's life when it was aired on pbs some years ago .
season three is great . the color is good , good scripts , maybe a little low on the volume but you just turn it up . we have not been disappointed .
i do n't remember this order , i think it was cancelled but i am really not sure to be honest with you .
its as campy as ever . we watched two episodes the other night , and they were as good as i remembered when i was a kid .
just a classic forever . the second of bing 's priest movies . it is delightful . the movie to bring a smile whenever your down .
i think this is an interesting story and worth the entertainment value . i 'm not a ben affleck fan but i think he did pretty well in this movie .
i absolutely love this movie . saw it years ago and was excited to find it on amazon . i have watched it many times .
i watch the hobbit : unexpected journey over and over again . it takes you on a small adventure that you always seem to enjoy .
got a chance to see the end of the story , got see the whole understanding from the beginning to the end .
i really loved the movie a lot . i remember seeing the movie a long time ago . i am into historical and military movies very much .
but this xmas movie did not compare to the 1st 2 movies . but im not saying it was bad . it did have its really funny parts , trust me .
bought the whole series to enjoy it over and over again . one of the better detective shows on tv during that period of time
cute . the order vs the game is off and some scenes end differently but if you liked the game , i 'd reccomend watching this .
alice is funny and a great show for the whole family to watch . it is a show to watch with your friends as well .
you watch this and only after you see video of the original movie do you realize how good it looks .
love this series , but watching them on tv they were all out of order . so i purchased the season to see the episodes in the proper order .
this is another type john wayne movie and is good for family viewing . it will be added to my collection and watched again . thanks , bobby j .
just like any musical from this time , its long but so worth it . the music is catchy , and the actors are wonderful . a must have for any fan of musicals .
its a decent movie that made me laugh a couple times a few let down , but over all id suggest watching it . its worth getting .
this is a great movie for the entire family . it is a classic . i had forgotten how much i enjoyed the movie . i can not believe it took me this long to buy it
it is great for people who like get smart humor . i like it and i think it is great .
i loved the pilot . the airplane bringing steve home . the scenes with danny and steve . excellent the way they all came together to make a team .
this series is very entertaining . it contains happy and sad moments that keep the story going . you will find yourself guessing at what happens next ...
i have always been interested in black and white movies from the past . those were when movies were clean and funny .
just bought this for a friend , i 'm not a eddie murphy fan since beverly hills cop !
good movie and cast of actors . did not realize it contained so much magic . maggie smith roles are always worth a watch .
the whole family liked this movie . everyone liked the movie . should not have to write a set amount of words for a review !
order was recieved within a few days ( 4 ) i was shocked and happy . although , this dvd was used , it is in perfect condition . thanks for the excellent service ! !
it was an entertaining story , and all the main characters were likeable and engaging . jeff bridges was great as always .
this movie was completely different to what i thought . i honestly thought it was about a haunted house . fascinating story line that keeps you hanging on until the very end .
this is a very entertaining family movie . well worth watching more than once .
this is a great dvd and if you are a journey fan and do n't own it - buy it now .
i enjoyed watching this season as well as all the others . i just wished that they kept going . they only have 5 seasons . all ages can watch charles in charge and will enjoy it .
if you want charm , comedy , love , and mystery , this movie will provide . the characters are well developed and you root for them during the entire movie .
how can anyone not like a john wayne movie . the scenes reminded me of all the wwii movies i have seen . enjoyed this film .
i love the action from beginning to end . keeps you on the edge of your seat . out of sight . if you like action this is the movie to see .
already saw this movie at the theater , but i want to have it for my collection . so i buy it !
got this for my other half . he is into movies and music dvds of all kinds . he said this was a good movie
i would have given this movie a higher rating if it had been in color . far better than average john wayne movie .
great writing great actors . very entertaining . has a twist in the love story that i did not see coming . life lesson attitude . funny . loved it .
acting was perfect . especially katherine hepburn . always one of my favorite love stories . a classic remake of another classic love story .
it 's a gary cooper film , i should n't have to say more . it 's a silver screen classic and a must see film .
good story and characters . i enjoyed the story even though it is a little predictable . love colin firth and was surprised at the chemistry between him and helen hunt .
the only problem i have with this dvd is it wont play on my dvd player , i have the video and it is great would recommend it to anyone
good movie , enjoyed it a lot and would watch this with my kids and grandchildren , will watch this movie often .
it was great to see it again and to get the bonus material . just added to the bonus material that came with the first release of the indiana jones series i got .
the picture was about 3 & # 34 ; high by 6 & # 34 ; long so the viewing was not good . in fact i could n't finish it .
we ca n't believe we 're watching animated movies - and loving them ! the ice age series is hysterical . we 're so glad we have a granddaughter to introduce us to fun movies again !
clint eastwood at the top of his game . the movie contains lots of plot twists and ends with a great love story .
this is another very good movie . lots of action . if you like john wayne you will love this movie . i 'm a big fan of john wayne in case you have n't figured that out .
the dvd is in good condition . no scratches on the disc . the movie was as good as we remember it .
love randolph scott was a great actor and better in westerns that other movies . i only want to see him in westerns
i loved all dogs go to heaven . i loved this one too but not as much as the first . but it was still really good : )
my sister loves it , we used to watch this when it was on tv and it scared us then as now
this is one of my favorites . now i can watch it every year during the holidays . great movie and product ! thanks !
this movie did have some funny parts to it - but it really was a stupid story all in all . it was really not worth the two hours of my life i wasted on it .
my daughter loved this disney classic ! she will watch it over and over i am sure . this was a quality product at a great price ! i would recommend this product and seller to anyone .
3d version is the best ! ! ! that is what i bought . animal house of children 's movies . pg rating is deserved .
what else needs to be said . bill murray nailed it and gives me pause to wonder : is there any role murray ca n't play ?
loved the whole series . so sad it 's over ; - ( . it was a great example of what good television writing is all about ... character development .
if you like science fiction with lots of wild action this is certainly one you do n't want to miss just be ready to turn down the volume at times .
excellent movie . if you like movies that are action packed and has plenty of action this is a must see .
this movie although well done and not a sleeper left you wondering what ? ? ? at the end . not any real end that left you wondering are they just leaving the door open for another sequel ?
if you are a fan of the terminator movies , you will like terminator 3. it was clear at the end that this would be the last of the terminator flicks .
neat movie . i hated the beginning . it was boring and full of fake , bad acting . my husband said `` keep watching '' and i was glad i did . this turned into a neat thriller
i 've always been a fan of robert downey jr. he is such a great actor . he plays his part of sherlock holmes really well . it is a awesome movie .
this is my all-time , favorite halloween movie . this is high quality , exactly as described . so happy to have this in dvd format now .
great movie . good price . nice packaging . this is a classic movie and was given as a present . my son and his wife enjoyed it , although scary because it 's based on a true crime .
having found out about this series during thanksgiving , makes me want to see the entire series in it 's proper sequence .
i gave this product five stars because i really like the movie . seen it once before and had to own the movie for myself .
this one was disappointing because it looked like such an interesting idea . but it was n't executed well . it felt forced and the ending is so annoying and stupid and mostly makes no sense at all .
great storyline , if people would listen to the message it would really help them in the tough times of life .
one of the funniest movies of all time . i love these guys working together . i hope there will be a part two to this one .
the quality was not good at all . it is an okay story line . not really what i expected to get .
a friend and i watch movies together often and once in a while we find something we both love . this is a wonderful movie ... as most will agree . watch it over and over and still laugh !
this movie is great no matter how many times you see it ; doris day and rock hudson were at the top of their game . it wo n't disappoint .
this was a edge of your seat , i ca n't believe how crazy she is movie . i would recommend watching this one .
tom hanks does n't usually disappoint and he did n't here either . was a good movie about fathers and sons . would highly reccomend to anyone .
very good movie . i have alot of christian end time movies . am waiting for the left behind series to continue
this was part of the series so i figured i needed it too i have read the books and this movie is cheesy
what can i say , it 's rush - and they are so dog gone good . i can never get enough of them .
stinks in every way . do n't waste any more of your time on this movie . stop reading now and move on .
this is in my opinion a well-done love story and remember of seeing the original way back when with bogart . it '' s just as good now .
i can watch this over and over again and never get tired of watching it . i like the concept entertaining
if you have a young barbie fan , this movie should delight and entertain . typical barbie movie plot , of course , but what little child does n't want a happy ending ?
each show can stand alone , but when you watch all of them you really can understand the characters . so funny ! !
i was pleased when i found this dvd . i like having the choice between regular dvd and blue ray . this was what i wanted for a reasonable price .
a great movie in the tradition of thriller horror . prince of darkness will not disappoint you at all . i hope more horror films were filmed this way , good acting and a great story .
it was as good on my kindle as the big screen maybe better because i noticed more on the screen because being smaller with a better field of view .
this is a different take than & # 34 ; in cold blood , & # 34 ; but i preferred this movie and thought this was daniel craig 's best role .
the plot was ok , the acting was very good , but i guess i was hoping for something that never came to me . crowe has done better movies .
this is another of my favorite old time movies , i love them together , i wish they would have done more movies together .
this is another great movie , it has brad pitt as one of the actors in it , that is why , i highly recommend it
i loved the show . now i 'm waiting for season 4 to drop in price . i have season three and loved that one too .
we really love this movie and the kids really enjoy it . love the singing and fun that the penguins have and how cute the are .
it was okay . not as good as i expected , but not horrible . . . . . . . . . .
definitely one of tom hanks best movies ever . it 's definitely worth re-watching . also makes a good christmas gift for anyone who loves historical dramas .
we enjoy almost any bbc series . this take place during wwii . very good . have watched it at least three times .
this is a great suspensful movie and very good acting . i recommend this to anyone . i have seen it a few times how and love watching it .
i bought this as a gift for my sister . we watched this movie nonstop when we were younger . odd story line ; no other really know characters other than charlie sheen . delivered promptly .
i have always loved this movie and was excited to see it in 3d ! it is a great family movie . the 3d was excellent and made the movie fun to watch again .
this is the kind of movie once you have seen it no need to see it again , you will enjoy the movie not much action
good action , not sure it follows the book , but decent movie to watch . scenery and location are worth seeing alone .
this one of the greatest shows of the 21 century . i hope it will bring more great episodes for years to come .
quirky and yet really funny ! well developed characters and exceptional writers . ca n't wait for the next season !
my only issue was the series is now over , i will miss it very much .
did this movie make any sense whatsoever to anybody who had not already read the books ? did this movie fail to disappoint anybody who had read the books ?
saw this for the first time when it was out in the theatres back in the 70 's . glad i ordered it for my collection .
i ordered this as a gift for a friend & she just loved it ! great product & service ! thanks !
i even enjoy watching it from time to time ... catching myself get into it when my sons got it on in his room ... .
one of the best movies i have ever seen , too bad we dont make movies like this in the usa . you cant go wrong on this one .
cute movie i actually wish it had lasted a little longer . great acting . not exactly what i expected but worth the watch .
this was an excellent movie ! kept me wondering who , what , when and where ... .i 'll watch it again , and recommend it highly !
this is a classic ! miles ahead of the disney version . and a heroine for the ages . this should be in every collector 's library . charming .
i know i am too old to really like this movie as much as i do ... but there is something about it .
great flick . story really holds you as well as the comedy making you laugh . it 's fun for the whole family .
it does n't get any better than this , ca n't wait for the next season . this is what entertainment is all about . great job !
this is a great compilation of three excellent animated features . good for the new generation or for adults looking to revisit childhood magic . definitely a good buy !
this is one of my christmas tradition . i watched these movies every time during the holiday season . i love them and i am very happy that i was able to find them all in one combo pack .
this was just a stupid idea for a film ! no talent actors and actresses , lame storyline , ridiculous `` scares '' . this movie is so bad it 's funny ! rent it and laugh for yourself !
bought at request of wife , all 4 seasons and she sat and watched every episode . what else can i say .
this was a gift to my brother , but he said it was in great shape & he 's thoroughly enjoying it .
i like these first two seasons better than the other seasons because it had a deeper meaning and better stories . i love super heroes and love the justice league . great fight scenes .
this movie is a great classic and i believe each generation of kids can relate to this movie . so , try it out ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
i love this movie the dances are great . the actors are great . and now i have all four of the movies .
it followed english history but the acting was just ok. i think the acting quality could have been better . thanks for your attention .
i love science fiction movies and enjoyed watching this one due to the incredible special effects . the story line became somewhat flat at times but the visual images kept my attention .
this box set is not as good as the last . that being said the anime itself is spot on . absolutely awesome ! ! !
a great family movie . we enjoyed watching it with our granddaughter . our original copy was damaged so we purchased this copy to replace it .
movies generally suck nowadays because its all mind control . people only watch movies to entertain themselves thats about it . t
oh , how i miss danny kaye . if you love to laugh , watch `` the inspector general . '' danny kaye could not only make us laugh , but could dance and sing as well !
omg ! i think everyone should own a copy of dirty dancing ! funny , emotional and romantic all at the same time .
history is something that should n't be forgotten and many people today do not realize how awful people can be treated right here in this country . the film was very educational and thought provoking .
i loved watching this show when it was still on cartoon network . i have only seen a few episodes of teen titans go ! honestly , this series i like a lot better than the new series .
great movie for the whole family ! i was just as excited to see it as the kids were . it was entertaining and quite funny ! !
i have trouble holding my interest , but i found this different than all the series that are out there . i did n't want it to stop
this movie was an unexpected surprise . it was a romantic comedy , but it was absolutely hilarious at times . i enjoyed it .
hilarious movie ; if you are an adult who likes comedy movie with a touch of human values and emotions you would love this movie .
this is one of the best concerts i 've seen on dvd . these guys are amazing performers , and they love what they do . the video and sound quality are flawless .
if your starting a collection of film noir or just want to watch some good writing on film catch this collection .
i enjoyed watching every episode . i do wish that certain characters stayed a little longer but all in all it was a great experience .
this movie is so boring , i almost feel asleep . anyways this movie is about a hobbit who has to stop a random dragon for some reason ( they never tell you why ) . not good at all
i liked this movie very much . it was interesting and i will by more from this producer in the future .
well , this movie sounded like something i would like to watch , but i am not into reading sub titles . so i shut it off .
we loved this series . relaxing and enjoyable ! we love the history and the beautiful scenery and a glimpse in the life of past times .
i , m glad i watched simply because it gets added to that collection . it was mediocre at best and if you 're not a horror movie fanatic i could n't recommend this .
this is one of my favorite movies . the players are fantastic . i love , love this movie ! i have bought one for home & travel .
best show on television . i highly recommend the show to everyone who has not seen it . brilliant acting , cinematography , costumes , storylines , etc .
please see my other reviews of this series it is well worth the purchase if you are into this sort of thing .
watched it because some friends said it was pretty good ... .but really not my type of movie . glad i did ! i loved it !
they really did a great job in making this flick , very suspenseful , keeps you on edge , all the actors did a great job with their parts simply awesome
the books were just brilliant . the film was , well ... average . it just did n't do the books the justice they deserved . but , for what it was , it was an enjoyable enough film .
dc does it once again in the animated movie department . honestly it 's worth it for the fight scene at the end alone much less all the other cool stuff in the movie .
a legend told once again . i think this story real . tells the story of the man . not just the famous gun fight .
great mini series i enjoyed this one . though if your looking for the romantic titanic it 's not that . this is more serious and dry think downton abbey on the water .
awesome and thrilling movie to watch . jason statham out did himself in this movie . i highly recommend it for anybody who love action .
i laughed throughout the entire movie ! it 's just so wrong that it 's right ! the case is hilarious and just shows why i would never travel with these guys anywhere !
they are a must ! now it 's even better without the commercials ! good , clean fun for the whole family in a box !
love this movie ! so excited to find it at this price . came in great condition very quickly . i highly recommend this dvd
loved it . maybe not for everyone but was definately different . give it a chance . it is one of those movies that you have to watch a couple times to take it all in .
i first saw this movie on netflix and fell in love with it.it 's a great twist on a classic story .
this is the best muppets anything ever made . probably one of the best christmas carol stories ever made too . great movie !
i would definitely recommend this movie to kids under the age of ten . it has a cute and heartwarming , but still funny , plot .
i watched this film over and over on tv . finally had to buy it so i could get all the action without commercials . shipped quickly and arrived in great shape , thanks !
i love this movie almost as much as my mother does and it came just in time before christmas . i am very please with my purchase
nothing happens . it just goes from nowhere to nowhere . worst movie i have seen in a long while . a waste .
we liked the film . our original copy was played out and we needed the new copy . no problems with it at all .
does anyone know why a boxed set of all the columbo episodes , including the later series , was released in the uk , but not in the u.s. ?
an excellent movie , especially since this is the original british version of the film . i highly recommend this film to anyone who loves rock n ' roll radio and the history involved . brilliant !
great product , fast delivery , i love this video and only had it on vcr tape , so i was afraid that we would love the vcr player so i purchased a dvd of it
didnt see to much difference in the unrated edition . thought i would see some funny clips not in the regular movie .
want something different from a zombie movie rather than the usual `` kill 'em all anyway you can '' type ? this is it . a funny , feel good movie about hope and love against the worst odds .
i have always loved the children of the corn movies . i watched them when i was younger and would recommend it to everyone !
good acting ... and very good up to date story line with a little mystery i recommend .
loved this movie . had rented it a while back and wanted to purchase it so i could watch it again and again .
pretty much action packed from beginning to end . thoroughly enjoyable ! ! makes you think about what the future could bring and will you be ready for it .
came in less than 3 days , was in the condition the seller said it was in , we will miss mr snipes ' movies for the next year
if you enjoyed the first series , you 'll love this continuing saga . will there be more ? this is a most entertaining program , especially if you enjoy period stories .
i missed this when it was on tv , started watching based on a good friend 's recommendation , and have thoroughly enjoyed the first season .
love it ... . if you saw season 1 ... you ca n't quit now . it just gets better and better ! the acting is great , realistic hospital scenes and just enough gore .
this was a great action movie with denzel washington and john travolta . they both played parts never seen them in before .
i will always miss the tv series , but this is a great way to relive it without the commercials , etc
a classic . we have seen the movie before , the stage presentation , and are happy to have the dvd so we can watch it again .
once again i love watching this series , and enjoyed the series ' movies that he made . i definitely recommend this dvd .
i think the trailer set the tone for the movie . the movie had some suspense , some action , but it did n't keep you on the edge of your seat . informative but kind of boring .
adults and children both will love this movie . very funny and good story . voices are perfect for each character . animation is done wonderful . defiantly worth a watch .
this is a well done set . all the movies are worth watching . if you like classic westerns , then you 'll like this set .
almost better than the first one in that you know all the characters as they go on to save the world again .
it 's a great movie . will ferrell and mark wahlberg do a great job , great humor , two hours of fun . well worth the money .
i 've watched this more than my granddaughter ! this is such a cute movie ! funny and holds a child 's ( and an adult 's ) interest !
love this series like batman it was one i grew up with so many memories . thus is the one for any superman fan
i originally saw this movie in the theater , and thoroughly enjoyed it . the dvd was just as entertaining . well worth the price .
loved this series . acting was superb and cast well . have watched it 3 times already . i recommend this to romance lovers and period lovers .
i give this move zero stars . watched it with my husband and we just could n't wait for it to be over . it was stupid , slow moving and a total waste of our time .
what can you say except this is one of the funniest shows on tv . now i can enjoy it whenever i want to .
this was a good movie . a little bit too bloody for young adults . the story line was good and keep my interest
i had the vhs and i would catch this on tv from time to time and it was one of those movies that you just like and watch everytime it came on .
very intriguing movie , great acting . you have to stay focused to keep up , but well worth it . keeps you wondering .
we were looking for a good movie to watch around halloween , although this is not halloween themed , it is a great childhood classic full of suspense for kids . easy to order . good quality
really liking the characters and their adventures in season 2. good character development and great plot twists . refreshing to not know what 's coming next . if liked season one give it try .
great movies of walt disney and will go down in the history book of movies by disney . . . .
my son enjoyed this movie very much . i did not see it myself , so it 's difficult to give a proper review .
the movie had a lovely story line and should be put on the family channel . this is recommended movie for family .
this dvd arrived in the condition advertised . i watched it and it was perfect . i 'd buy from this vendor again .
one of my favorite movies i have been waiting for on blu ray . great movie - great transfer to blu ray ! !
loved the books the first movie was ok. this one was much better . ca n't wait for the next movie to come out . i got this in the mail the day it came out in stores
the movie is not for me i was helping my sister buy the movie and it arrived on time she was very happy thanks
you have to see this movie in 3d only for the clarity and depth . you will want to walk into the screen at some of the shots . they have such a realistic view .
no wonder the series ran so long . this show was terrific . wish it still could be just as it was .
i love the old classics and this one is it . this brings back a lot of childhood memories . i love it
this movie was enjoyable to watch , loved the costumes acting was good . i never saw it on the big screen but wished i had because i 'm sure it would have been really fun
okay you just have to watch all the doctor shows every made , from the last 50 years . it might take a long time but it is better than other shows out there .
i did n't order this movie and i didnt watch this , so i cant say if it was good or not
i really enjoyed the movie and recommend it to anyone interested in the entertainment industry . this movie was very uplifting and appropriate for all age groups . the actors were perfect and so was the story .
this is a great kids and family movie . i laughed more times than i ever imagined i would . i had to watch it again just to see what i missed when i was laughing ! !
it is no wonder that robert duvall won an award for this one . it is especially good if you like country music but it is a powerful film at all levels .
this was a great movie . i 'd watch it again if i owned it . i 'd like to see the special features on the blu - ray edition .
this was a predictable plot but well acted ... though a little ridiculous ... .the country was gorgeous . did kevin kline do a brilliant job of speaking french badly or does he really speak french ...
i ordered this movie for someone else and they said they liked it very much and was glad that i had ordered it for them .
definitely one of the best seasons of this show ! i could n't stop watching & i got other people hooked on this show as well ( :
i love the characters and their interactions . each brings a certain element to the show . writing is good and so is the acting .
i do n't usually watch movies more than once , but i ended up buying this one and enjoy it each time .
if you like holocaust movies you will enjoy this one . i can watch it over and over and never get tired . its just one of those movies you enjoy !
season after season after season , this show just gets better and better and better . i can only hope it last at least another three seasons ! ! !
crazy story that just makes you laugh . christopher walken is always good and his characters always colorful . where do people come up with these of the wall scripts ?
fast service , good price , my granddaughter loves horses she 'll enjoy clean good programming , this is good for all ages alike
this is one of those movies from way back when that while not up to our cgi of today is still fun to see and a family film . so for blast from the past buy this film and enjoy
i discovered that i had the second movie but not the first so i ordered it out . it came promptly and was in great condition .
i 'm always glad to see a movie with hanks in it . story is about a little boy coming to terms with his best friend 's death ... his father . sad .
i ordered this dvd as a birthday gift for my daughter and she loved it ! she is a lover of anything english !
it 's family guy ... so of course it gets 5 stars . i have all of the disc sets so i basically get anxious for each release . and i am never disappointed .
oscar winning performance by one of my favorite actors mr. nicolas cage ! he turned drinking into an art form in this movie .
this is just so great . he has a great way of giving us the light side of men in a funny sort of way !
this has always been a favorite film of mine . i 've seen it so many times , i can quote along with the dialogue as the film plays . so glad to add it to my library !
this movie is one of my favorites ! ! ! ! ! i can watch it over and over , it has such a cute story line !
this was a very interesting special that was in keeping with the christmas theme for the specials love all the twists

i you love lucy you need this movie . it is a nice movie to have in your collection as its light hearted and funny .
the kids and i love this movie . it is actually better than i thought for a 3rd movie in the series .
this actress makes a really good impression of ms. jane marple . and the stories are pleasantly depicted . the english settings add to this .
i could n't wait to get this movie . i have tried to get this movie for a long time but no local stores had it so i had to order it online .
i got this for my grandsons . i have no idea how often they watch it , but they asked for it , so i 'm guessing they like it .

it is still a classic movie and just as good as i remember , love it . i need to get the whole frankenstein collection
always fun to watch and enjoy ... ... looking forward to the next film . i have seen the trailers and it looks dark .
this movie plays just as stated : widescreen , with english subtitles , great picture and color ! ! i will definite order more of like quality movies .

hubby loves this movie and always watches it on tv , now he can watch it any time and it any color . : - )
we found the movie to be very good . my husband who does not care for some of the older movies even enjoyed this classic .
this is a great movie ! definitely worth the money . costner is great in this movie , as is the rest of the cast .
my son actually got me started watching these movies cause we both like zombie movies . i would recommend watching the first season . if you like zombie movies these are great to watch !
the show is as hilarious as i remember it . it 's just a shame that they could n't have included the missing episodes . maybe they 'll pop up some day .
i watched this movie , and i was in awe . i could n't believe how someone could come up with such a creative plot . if you love horror movies , then you ca n't miss this one .
makes you laugh and cry , all in the same movie . sweet movie with a lot of very funny lines . had me laughing out loud .
if you like musicals , this is a nice version of a christmas carol . not he best but a good version .
i have always been a superman fan and have to say still enjoy them its is great tv program to watch
and marvel animated are pretty good too , so i have no problem giving it a 5 star rating before it comes out
i found it on an old vhs tape and it took me forever to find out what the name of it was . i was thrilled to find this on amazon !
slow , slow , slow - not what i 've come to expect from british television . looks like they 've come a long way since this series !
this was a good movie ... a little different part for aniston but she can do most anything and look good doing it .
i thought this was a terrific series and wish it did n't end so soon . too bad they did n't release the old spiderman series they had on tv a long time . worth the money to get .
the movie was funny and it has some good moral lessons for the family . the entire family enjoyed this movie
i knew it was a simple story line , but i had to get it anyway , i 'm like that . . . i still feel it was a very worthy purchase , no doubt !
this is a very good movie , i 'm glad that i purchased it for my video collection . there is lots of action , and stone cold is great in the movie

i love the villain ! he is really a smart , clever , kick ass guy . who needs anyone else ! superior race yes indeed ... give me some of that blood .
i admit that i did n't watch much of this show . but what i saw was predictable with a mediocre cast . i had no interest in staying with it .
i was very pleased with season 10 and truly enjoyed how they changed the characters .
i happened upon this show by chance and i absolutely love it . i 've watched every season except for 4. waiting for that to be free . this is a must watch show .
would recommend this to everyone ! ! ! received my copy and have watched it more than once . ca n't beat a comedic love story !
the movie was great i loved every minute of it one of the best movies yet i give it a 10 across the board .
never get tired of this movie . love cher and nicholas cage ! great actors and real life issues that people can relate to !
typical steven segal action . lots of kung fu action . i love to watch in fight , but i swear he runs like a girl

i love this collection i 've worn out two video collections the godfather films have never sounded or looked more clear
used amazon prime to catch up for free . you can tell a lot of money went into making this show . i do n't think you will be disappointed .
this has been a favorite of mine for years . ca n't beat the cast and a very special western - ca n't tell you how many times i have watched this movie
intense yoga work out ! i love it because it is relaxing yet challenging at the same time . i really like this dvd . my favorite yoga ever : )
i saw this way back when i was a kid and thought it was romantic and fun - and i really enjoyed seeing it again !
more than worth the time for miller and brown , it has value also as a glimpse of another age in both life and movies .
a deep sci-fi movie ! you become part of the character , and it stays with for a while ! watched it several times !
this is a great set if you like the x-files , the set also included the 2 x-files movies this was a great bonus
because denzel is a great actor in all his movies , i just wanted to see him rock it which he did . the movie was alright
a treasure for those who went to the movies back then . clean , innocent , and happy times . theme well thought out and makes me feel young again .
not a madea , but still funny . the movie has a true family meaning with the usual hidden message . you have to laugh sometimes to keep from crying .
enjoyed this movie so much i bought the dvd . it 's an action-packed , fun , creative movie fun for animal lovers of all ages .
perfect for any true movie fan ! and if you a comic book head even better . great acting , effects , and action .
this is a very well put together movie . great story line and great acting . a must see !
very great movie enjoyed it very much , a lot of great action , very fine acting , the plot was great hope they make more movies like this one .
what a couple ? ? ? ? these two actors are always great together - loved every movies i have with them in it .
would recommend to anyone who loves a good comedy and enjoys good comedic dialogue . good character tension and entertaining plots .
without a doubt this is the best show of this genre ever done . the acting is excellent . it holds you .
the movie is amazing , the effects , the storyline and the ending . surround sound makes it even better .
alright movie ... the ending was no surprise ... you can figure out where this movie is going once the two lead stars are introduced to each other ... but okay and would tell you to watch
this classic sci-fi movie is a must have in blu-ray . it 's amazing what they can do with a movie this old . you notice details you 've never seen before .
as always amazon came through by sending another good quality dvd . i would recommend amazon highly . have n't got a bad dvd yet .
i had great memories of what a great soundtrack i thought this movie had . after purchasing it , i realize that the soundtrack was good but the sound quality is n't and the movie itself is plain bad .
i 'm a movie buff and love the old movies . this dvd was an excellent addition to my collection . great movie .
great addition to my class lesson plans . students like to view the film and compare it to the novel . great version of the high school book .
i bought this for my mom because it was on her christmas list . she absolutely loves this mini-series and therefore has been very happy with this dvd .
one of the more creative movies i 've seen this year . jay z helped produce this and there is a lot of his music on here . great flick .
if you really want to laugh and enjoy a good movie this is it . it has everything , comic situations , love , romance , ghosts , unexpected ending , and great actors .
i brought this movie because i am a fan of joan crawford , but i found this movie to be a bit corny . the acting was not as good as other joan crawford movies .
the movie was not for me , it was a gift for my husband . i rated it the way i did because it is one of my husband 's favorite movies .
each one of the short stories were interesting but the last one had the most powerful message . some of the acting was over done but not terrible .
a personal drama with an excellent message . the scenery is pretty awesome as well . was worth seeing twice , first with my wife then with my daughter .
hugh laurie at his best and a show that everyone should see , it has everything !
an interesting buy if you watched this sort of thing as a child . i got it only because it was cheap at the time .
how can you go wrong with a martin sheen movie ? the story is a good one and even if the movie is old - its worth the time to watch it
the same goes for all of the 007 collection i purchased . i see now that the cheap prices offered was for in furious products .
read the book before watching the movie . i was hooked after the first movie.it 's a great sci-fi fantasy to take your mind off of the everyday real life .
loved it ! each episode makes me laugh each time i watch . shipment came in three business days and in perfect condition ! thank you i 'm one happy happy happy person jack !
good movie to just sit and watch . just enough action to keep it going . very well picked actors and actresses .
i really enjoyed this movie - morgan freeman 's role was a surprise but very entertaining . i would recommend this move to anyone .
if you like british war movies it 's ok. ( i do ) not something i would care to watch more than once , tho ' .
these are two of the funniest 80s movies . if you 've ever had a weird neighbor or thrown money into a project , these movies are for you .
cute but not great , nothing else much to say but since there is a minimum amount of words for these reviews i 'll have to say there is nothing else to say .
i purchased this my mistake , but it was a mistake that turned out well . i liked this movie and the graphics were amazing . definitely worth adding to your library
good movie . would have preferred that it was based more on the original movie ( mars ) but it does have more action scenes and great graphics . you will enjoy it .
gave it as a gift , so i think she really liked it . i will ask her later for a review .
it has its frightening moments , if you liked the movie saw this is up your alley
was n't that good as the second one from the series . but its worth a shot .
this movie is one of the best story lines i have ever seen . this would be a great movie for the whole family .
good sci-fi movie with great special effects . i have the 3d version and it is awesome compared to the dvd version
i received this in a combo deal . the show and movie are good . this is ok. but the quality and packaging was great . i was quite satisfied with my selection from amazon .
i liked watching this second movie , in this new series , as much as i enjoyed first seeing the series opener .
this was the best start trek series . ca n't get enough of it . gave this as a gift . my dad loves them .
to bad i waited so long to get the dvd . it had become rather expensive . i saw them in a store a few months back for a more reasonable price .
it is what it is . i did n't expect much out of this movie . it did slightly out perform my low expectations .
i watch pbs on a regular basis . i love the sitcoms and i also love the british movies . there is such class in them . love these
i liked this movie . it was scary but i did catch myself laughing . overall it 's a good rainy day rental .
i liked the story and acting . a cut over most tv shows that is for sure . lets have more like it .
i could watch this one over and over . the chemistry between meryl and clint is great which makes the story so believable . a great love story to be enjoyed by a mature audience .
i hated this movie when i first saw it in theaters , but it eventually grew on me , and now it 's one of my favorite horror films . here 's hoping they make a 3rd .
i thought that the movies were very good and that they are very good for kids .
i am looking forward to season 4. i wish they would hurry up with production . this product comes well packaged and at a good price . i recommend it to everyone who enjoyed this series in the past .
i know this movie isnt on some peoples top list to watch , but for me i thought it was a great movie
this is a great , great movie . the acting is superb and the story line fascinating . i have watched it many times because i so enjoy it .
very exciting show . more drama in 24 hours than one can handle in a lifetime !
hey look , the songs are great but when i had the dvd , the sound or at least the 5.1 sucked . only for serious collectors .
i watched this movie on hbo and i thought it was very confusing and hard to follow . i still dont really understand it .
it is psych how could you say anything less then love it . arrived on time and without any damage , very pleased .
i have the entire frasier collection . the writing and character chemistry is the best . i enjoy watching this series over and over . the best of personal entertainment for the money !
well the movie lived up to it 's name ... non-stop action . clever script that will leave you guessing till the end .
the case and the dvd were in very well kept shape . it played perfect and i am pleased with my purchase . thanks !
good performance by some of our times greatest actresses . funny and heart warming while at the same time a little sad .
i loved every season of this show ! thank u for deliver this show to me on time ! love the whole cast ! i recommend this to family and friends
love this movie . i had heard poor reviews but i do n't understand it , i enjoyed this and was ready for the second installment
i wish it could have been picked up by another station . this was an amazing group with an awesome set of writers . seriously , the good shows are being replaced with crap .
a good movie that will keep you in your seat but not a major award winner . this is n't a movie for everyone .
i loved all the new episodes . i watched every episode and i will continue to buy each season that becomes available . the case is broken
this was a thoroughly enjoyable movie . i love movies and it is very hard to find decent ones these days .
of course the previews look cute but it was a silly , long movie glad i did n't buy the dvd for the full price
again we are so happy to be able to buy this on amazon because it was always sold out in stores in our area !
it was a very entertaining movie . when it started i thought i was going to be disappointed , but i was glad i watched it .
my daughter is a collector of lucy shows . myself watched her shows too , was very funny but gives pleasure watching movie .
steven 's dry delivery and forward thinking is so very funny ; he gets me every time . this dvd is worth the watch !
always thought this was one , if not the best , science fiction movies ever made . this should be in your collection if you want to watch sci-fi .
i enjoy all the movie that i order i have not seen it yet but i no that i , m going to enjoy watching when i make time you no i love all my movie
i 've enjoyed watching this movie several times . i believe it 's a wonderful story and the actors are excellent with their performance .
i love this film ! this is by far one of my favorite classic films . how could it not be , with such a great cast ?
you just ca n't beat the old classics and this is one of them ! i would recommend it to anyone who would like to spend time watching a classic
this is as funny today as it was years ago . good views great comedy . would recommend this dvd . the sequel was not as good as the first but still funny .
i really enjoyed the performances . the singing was very good . it featured some of my favorite actors that i have n't seen in a while ...
this is one of the classic old tv shows that i really enjoyed back the in my younger years . today these type of shows do not exist .
this is a beautifully written and thought provoking move - this would be enjoyed by all age groups . you wo n't be disappointed .
combo comes with good extras and movie itself is quite entertaining . it 's nice to have in your collection for those days you need to laugh and relax .
bought this to complete my set of murder she wrote tapes . just what i wanted . saw probably all of them on tv , but wanted my own to keep . great .
have n't watched yet ! tommy lee jones is one of my favorites ! i think my hubby ordered this movie , i will watch in the future !
this video may appeal to those who enjoy historical documentaries . i was looking for something a little different than this .
i waited for this to be at a reasonable price , leave it to amazon to get a good deal ! it will be added to my grand babies disney classic collections
it was a great movie especially if you love action movies you will like this one a lot , going to get 2 .
been waiting for part 1 and 2 of the final act to come out for a while . great anime . dvd was delivered quickly and in good condition . good subtitles .
the pilot was way to gory , way to fast , lost it for us ! wow not a family show at all !
this was one of the best movies of it 's time . great story line , good acting and one of denzel 's first . the cast was excellent .
we enjoyed it as much this year as in previous years . a good movie to enjoy with friends and family .
this show certainly has it violence and drama and never stops . i like it but realize it would not be for everyone
i was thinking it was going to be like saw , it was different but it did make me think
i love this movie good movie for anyone who loves these kind of movies great beach scenes in it too
this many awesome movies in one set , how could you go wrong ? i bet you ca n't watch them all in one day !
this movie makes me laugh every time i watch it . very funny , great movie to own . buy this movie now
this movie is in my top ten . when i want to watch a movie but do n't know what i want to watch i 'll see this in my collection and will not have to look any longer .
the movie was entertaining and tommy lee jones was great , but ashley judd 's performance was a little lacking . i would not watch this movie again .
the writers are fantastic . the transformation of the original to todays 's sherlock is terrific to watch . i have every film back to the beginning and some are disappointing but this is truly worth your time .
thank you this is a really great movie and the condition of the dvd was in really good shape , thank you
this is one of the best series ever . think i have all of them now . i hope they continue him in the p d james books .
the bonus features were an exciting look into the new way this musical was made . i watched and learned so much more about the movie , actors and people involved in making this .
just what i expected in great quality . recommended to all action fans buy it you wo n't be disappointed especially at its new low price .
a great storyline and good acting makes this movie worth the time to view it . as a matter of fact i watched it more than once . no problems with this purchase .
great show , love that is is available for free for prime members . at times it can be a little slow but there are enough unexpected twists to keep you watching .
i love all doris roberts movies . this is a great movie , would recomend mrs. miracle to anyone . it 's a great family movie .
i love the women in this movie , they are a great combination of actresses . i love the revenge factor in this movie .
tom cruise is such a good actor . this is full of action and adventure and a great story line , too . it does n't have disgusting language either .
a great movie worth its price . i can watch this movie more than once . would love to see more romantic movies like this one . i felt in love with all the characters .
if you are looking for a romantic movie that is light and fun , this is a good one . very cute .
this movie is awesome i love it if you like comedy you will like this i know for me it is awesome i would recommend it
we had not seen this movie for over ten years but we watched last night and we enjoyed it . i do not think it will be 10 years before we watch it again .
i own the movie set so this was perfect addition . i love the story and how it keeps the saga going great cast and tender love story
enjoyed it from beginning to end , great stuff . had really good action and fx with great funny moments . 2 thumbs up .
once again johnny depp is good ! ! movie a little slow at first . but enjoyable . the humor was great . and you cant forget the lone ranger theme ! ! ! that made the movie .
i bought this dvd , because i have n't seen the original star wars since it came out in the theaters 30 years ago . it was great to see it again .
little to no extras . this great film deserves better treatment than this . we can always hope .
is n't the same as ny 's - you know how to spell it ! i do n't think any of them are as smart as they are made out
this show is so hard to get in dvd format ... in any format so if you can find it , grab it ! kevin james is hilarious and has a clean show .
it was ok ... thought it would b alot more action packed as most of his movies r so that is why i am disappointment more then finding it terrific .
what a wonderful and timeless movie with such a great cast . this movie is a new classic in my book .
just buy it . it 's a quality sitcom that stands the test of time . you ca n't go wrong with this entire series .
we loved this cartoon movie . my husband does not like cartoon movies but he did like this one . it is funny and cute .
this is a great series . probably one of the best out there along with oz , sex and the city , and game of thrones .
great story , excellent acting , good direction , produced by clint eastwood , who never makes bad pictures . a movie that is well worth watching .
i was very surprised that i 've enjoyed watching the reruns of this star trek spin off as much as i have .
this movie did n't hold my girls attention as well as the newest care bears movie so i would n't really recommend it .
my husband loves this show and is enjoying is on our kindle . once he is done , i will begin watching it .
great series - would highly recommend to any child of the 90 's ! entertaining and hilarious are the best words to describe it !
it was fun for a family night night but i did n't think it was as good as 1 or 2. kids will stay entertained .
anything with statham i 'll watch but this was one of his earlier movies and you could tell it was kind of a & # 34 ; b & # 34 ; movie , but it was watchable .
whether you prefer dramas or action , this movie should do it . love , family , hunting , murder , etc . i would watch it again .
great for the 5th time and after all these years . like that they are able to follow characters thru the the whole war
i absolutely loved the movie . it 's a movie that would be good for kids & adults . the animation is awesome .
i liked it , it was the better of the two movies of the same name and great movie for the whole family
i enjoyed the love story and the unusual characters . it was well played and enjoyed the actors and actresses they picked .
i would say that she is the main reason that i gave a 4 stars . i forgot snow white 's name , but i think she still has some space to improve in terms of acting skills .
i did n't think i would like this at first . now it 's one of my all time favs . imagination was brought to life in brave
an interesting , true story with many actors doing a good job of portraying the soldiers saving valuable art during ww ii .
a very moving performance of the famous story ! ! excellent voices and good acting - memorable scenes and beautiful music . a must for opera fans !
love the series ! ! ! can not wait for season 6 to come out ( hopefully ) ! ! : ) the product came in wonderful shape and earlier than the actual shipped date ... no complaints !
i love eddie murphy this is one of the best show he ever did i had to have this dvd .
very good - edge of your seat type . good entertainment . people told me it was scarey so i was expecting a horror movie - which it was not - but i liked it
watch the movie with my family during this week & everyone liked it . will check the internet for more movies .
i saw breaking dawn 2 in the theaters and could n't avoid purchasing the movie in the end . now i have the complete set and will be able to enjoy anytime !
its not what it use to be , i think they are trying to kill the show on purpose after killing it and bringing it back .
i enjoyed this movie . the characters were fun and several parts had me laughing out loud . this is one of my go to and re-watch movies .
this is an excellent movie that i will watch over and over again . great cast and good story line .
the show was ok lots of action . i think you love it if you love model airplane you will this movie .
very interesting movie because i kept thinking that i would know what would happen next and i was wrong every time . it was definitely a powerful movie that made me think about my value system .
this film was suggested to me and i really loved it . it has great teaching moments and a breath of fresh air .
a great show , the concept and plot was very good , it is only a pity that it never took off . we did not even get it here in australia that i know of .
great cast , quite different from anything else i have seen ! i liked the ending and the fact that they had all become friends !
a lot of times the second or third can never live up to the original . this is n't one of those . both 1 & 2 are great .
i would n't waste my money on this had i known it would be so stupid , tatum channing is good looking , but this movie is n't his best move
love this movie and had a great time watching it with my family . my children watch it again and again .
i got this for my dad - he really liked john garfield - i saw this also and it is one of his best .
good old tv series back when the whole family could watch and i say i wish we could bring back that country i was a child in .
amazon has yet to ever disappoint me and i have purchased from them for many years . this is to place to go .
good show but the most important thing : horrible packaging ! ! please go back to the old way !
van damme what else do you need both great movies just the best for all us fans of van damme work i think these are two of his best works
i love this series so much and was sad to see it only had two seasons , i want them to release the rest
what can i saw about this that has not already been said . one of the better movies from the sixties . good acting through out and no surprises .
great movie saw it when i was 12 , its was great back then and its just as great now !
one of clint eastwood 's better movies . i 've watched it several times and have enjoyed it each and every time . no critic here , just one man 's opinion ... it is a great movie .
this is a great old movie that is based on a true story . a must have for any world war ii fan .
kept you interested in the next scene , stayed true to the plot . worth watching again just to see costumes an d colors
i thought it was a great film . i really like the animation style , my kids liked the movie a lot and it kept them very interested .
i got this set for a great price and very good condition and we watch them over and over again .

we read the play in class using the no fear shakespeare version . i then showed the students this movie . they loved it .
love this animated movie . it will be a classic i 'm sure . ca n't wait to see it one day in 3d .
i bought this movie for my mom at christmas time too . she loves the movies of this actress .
i was rather disappointed in this movie . i love dvd and movies that are in this period . i always watch the movie twice before i have a strong opinion on it
great movies to share with the family . need more of the american girls to watch with the grand children . loved them all .
we purchased and received the dvd i am legend on time in new condition . this dvd is a wonderful addition to our library dvd collection . thank you so much
one of my favorite wayne films . no one did a western like he did . i try to add to my collection every so often .
i liked the movie way back when and was excited to see it on dvd . totally 80 's movie but i still like it
excellent mystery . it really keeps you thinking . i look forward to seeing season two .
to much cussing , and inappropriate ... did not even get through five minutes of the movie , and i had to turn it off ...
i bought this for my granddaughter . she was really pleased to get it and i was really pleased with the low price .
the acting was so bad that i could n't finish it . yes , there was a lot of action of that 's all you want this might work for you .
i gave it this rating as it was great to watch as you never knew what was going to happen . it would have used a bit move action .
the acting is over the top , but pretty usual for that era and subject content . typical teen movie ( not so much now ) , but it sure was great back then !
now i can see this every night and every i can . judy is a great actress with an outstanding voice
good movie with a good story . for once , i liked julia roberts , but i feel the rest of the cast made the movie . i enjoyed it very much .
not done yet but it gets very interesting . now i do not miss any episodes anymore some of them are kind of silly but i do not miss .
we loved this one . i highly recommend it . it will leave you smiling and feeling good . a great date movie . will smith is awesome ! !
i highly recomend this movie . it was very interesting . i still ca n't figure out if this guy is blind or not .
the movie was good not only for myself but for my grandchildren as well . i have recomended it and will continue to do so thanks
great movie for the family . learn the value of free speech in america , but also that there must be christ 's love portrayed in our lives ! a little girl teaches everyone a lesson ! !
this is an interesting sci-fi animation . great for both kids and adults . has a new twist on alien invasion . not predictable !
have been doing this workout since it came out years ago . it 's like dancing and it 's fun . just wish it was on dvd .
michael j. fox did a fantastic job in this movie . it arrived on time and in great condition . i love the music too !
i did not watch the first one and was still able to follow it for the most part but it might have been more enjoyable if i knew the back story .
i found this movie extremely boring . it felt like nothing ever happened . i ended up turning it off . not at all what i expected from a sci-fi tom cruise movie .
i have not watch this my daughter said it was real good , wish i could tell you more , i do not watch many cartoons .
broadway - i love it . the music is great . the production is done beautifully . the colors are outstanding . very enjoyable .
robot and frank is a really good movie . watching it will make you appreciate your friends and family a little more .
any football sports fan would find this movie enjoyable . it is a faith based movie that can be used with all ages . great movie for the price and good to add to a collection .
how can it be any better or worse than 5 for columbo . excellent videos and very entertaining . love to have friends over for this
this would have recieved a 5 star if it had subtitles . i enjoy the movie , but i need subtitles . if you dont need them , feel free to buy and be entertained .
but the 1 joke seemed to never end and there 's gon na be a sequel so will add it to collection as well
probably albert brooks best writing and acting . of course meryl streep was very good and beautiful . it 's nice that a good movie never gets old .
seriously ... what was this ? i think the kids have to be older to enjoy this . no one liked it in our house . not even laughable . just ... bad .
there is no doubt to own this dvd . both actors are so good and funny . they are picking the right person for this show . very funny , sometimes .
this dvd was received in a timely manner . i am very happy with it .
this movie was pretty entertaining but not one of the best with these two actors . i would definitely watch again though .
one of the best syfy movies ever made , jodie foster and james woods totally makes this movie , i 'm glad i finally got to see it
another good movie in the men series . the movie was packed with action and suspense . i did enjoy the story and overall movie
i love this movie it is tense and the acting is good . nicole kidman does a great job making us feel for her .
i really enjoyed this movie . it went so well with the & # 34 ; love & # 34 ; series . i especially liked st. nick and the snow .
we have & # 34 ; let it ride & # 34 ; in vhs so obviously of no use anymore . i plan to buy the dvd . we absolutely love it . so funny .
i really loved this movie . the twist they threw in at the last was great . i really was n't expecting that .
it is a children 's movie after all . i had forgotten what a dumb story it was . by today 's standards too much singing and dancing .
came in its original box . very nice , no scratches . great movie . good for the holidays or when you need a bill murray classic .
i love the series , very entertaining , got it at a great price , would recommend it to anyone . waiting to get season 5 .
you have to listen carefully , as there are several turns in this movie , that keep it exciting . well worth watching
action , intrigue , twists and turns . everything a good spy film needs . if you like the mi movies you will like this one as well . another great episode of spy adventure .
awesome transfer to a great movie . definitely worth the dvd to blu upgrade . the picture and sound has never looked so good .
facing the giants , all i can say is you must get this movie . takes you back to high school , and college ball . and it will make you think about things you should think about .
great movie , she 's growing up to be a really good actress . the movie came really fast , thanks !
very funny , dirty jokes , but i watched 10 times and they do n't get old ! ! ! santa is bad as it can be ! ! ! some lines you wo n't forget ! ! !
i love nicholas cage as an actor and he does good work in all of his movies , this movie was humorous as well !
this was a wonderful movie . i think it was one of gregory peck 's first movies . i loved the story line and the class of the actors .
this movie is magical and fun . it is great for the whole . family too enjoy . this is the second movie . be sure and watch them in order .
we have enjoyed this season as much as the last three so far . we are only about half way through it , but it is laugh out loud funny most episodes .
one of my husbands favorites . my dad watched war films . i 'm not into this . but if you love war flicks then this is one for you .
i thought it was a terrible movie . i ca n't believe i actually wasted my time ! ! the plot was terrible and it could have been better . bottom line is do not waste your time !
good plots and many surprises . can be watched with family and grown up kids . needed more reality stories and that will make it perfect
the previous 3 movies were excellent - this one was poorly done , i wasted my money - rent it if you can .
this dvd was shipped in a timely manner , good condition . i like this movie and i would recommend the seller again .
i love having added this to my collection ! it 's very good . if you like horror then i recommend this one !
it really is different , not what you would expect but very well written , comical , has action and great lesson , overall very good .
story line is decent . but the movie starts out slow . you need to stick with it in the beginning . then it pick ups and becomes more entertaining .
this movie has some of the most spectacular scenery . the story was captivating and the characters were strong . if you like musicals you will absolutely love this movie .
i really love this show . love the fact i can purchase it and watch on my kindle ! ! ! hope the seasons keep on coming .
this one is a fun watch . it is n't great cinema , but who cares ?
my husband really liked this series as for me not so much . i 'm not into war shows . my husband would recommend it highly . happy watching
a great sequel to the first one . so nice to have no swearing , no sex , and yet a good movie .
i love this series and i love james garner . this is a great series with wonderful car chases and surprises ... .
i just finished watching this and although i saw this movie when it was first shown on tv , it is still a great movie to watch .
this movie is right down funny -- if i would like it , anyone would -- robin williams plays the right part , owen wilson is also funny in this movie
johnny depp has done better . could be the theme of the movie , but it was mildly comical and somewhat boring at times .
nice action packed movie with lots of twist and turns it was a great story line too you should watch if your into action movies
it kept my interest and being the second in the series , i know that there is much more to come .
i have n't watched this movie in years . it has definitely stood the test of time . great casting too . fonda is amazing !
what a great show ! i highly recommend the complete series . it is laugh out loud entertainment for all !
i purchased this season for a christmas gift . it was priced very well and will be much enjoyed . arrived promptly .
this is an excellent movie ! i would recommend it to anyone . the actors did a great job and there was a lot of action in the movie .
keeps the children and grand children busy . very good story . would recommend to anyone looking for some good family entertainment .
this movie is a time killer , not an enjoyable experience . the first one was better . the cheese in this one is too much to handle .
the color was poor and the acting left a lot to be desired . i am sorry i purchased this movie . i am a big fan of tom selleck too .
this show is the best and i love to watch it all the time that it is on tv everyday
only got this movie because it had close caption . it was okay but to me .
bought for a gift and my husband loves this movie . it is great that gives you an option of digital copy so you can watch it on ipad or computer when traveling .
this dvd is filled with some of the great up and coming stars of the 1980 's . tom cruise is great !
just love horror films . starting a tradition where i buy at least one horror film in october from now on .
not a bad movie , it just did n't grab me . plenty of stars , acting was n't bad , writing was n't bad , i just did n't feel involved in the story .
very good writing - could n't stop watching it . ca n't wait to watch the next 2 seasons . would love to visit london .
this is a cute movie , and i recommend it to anyone who had small children and want a fun movie that is n't scary .
i could not stop watching this series until it ended ! it is fantastic , historical , interesting and entertaining ! i highly recommend it to anyone who likes this genre of films .
each episode sets up a unique problem for the team and there is lots of heart put into the program . very good work .
dean martin and all of the others is these films make them all worthwhile . i have a friend who is in it as a favor to dean and that made it even better .
this was a fun movie for the whole family . definitely one to keep . it has only one toy which all kids want to be aware .
i found it entertaining and suspenseful . some of the scenes could have been done better but overall i enjoyed it .
i already forgot what it was about . so that may tell you something . i do n't have the seven more required words .
each season just seems to get better than the last . i am really looking forward to watching season 5. thanks
i now have the entire series . it is the best series yet ! i ca n't think of another series that has gone ten seasons and two movies .
i was pleased to receive the dvd 's so promptly . both are like new and the price was very reasonable .
i like certain john wayne movies , and this is one of them . while this is n't really what you would call a christmas movie - it does take place over christmas time in hawaii .
i was a very excellent product , i like this movie , to everyone who likes this kind of movie , very good product .
i had this dvd already , but i guess i wore it out i watched it so much ! had to order another copy . ca n't beat the price . so worth it .
it is a great series but often hard to understand what is being said due to accents but it has suspense , drama , a bit of comedy and strong violence
this was always a fun tv series . just wanted to experience it again . for old or young this is a fun series
i can not believe that my kids liked this ! some of the parts were extraordinary and then some were like is this the same movie ?
this was so i had something at the house for my granddaughter and since she does n't get to come very often we have not watched it yet
thought this was your typical scary movie . it has a different twist and it takes it to another level sci fi unrealistic events . strange movie but not the worst i 've seen .
i chose 5 stars because this is the best show i have watched in a long time . i think they have a great cast of actors that work very well together .
this flick is super funny and very family friendly . i would recommend for kids and adults . we love this movie .
love clint eastwood . amy adams is great as well . i would recommend this . i highly recommend this movie . fast delivery too .
this is a good musical . it has great music and actors who can really act !
i ordered this as a gift and decided to keep it . another great old school movie , it a must have to add to your collection item . quick shipping and nice picture quality .
it does n't get any better . sherlock holmes on blu ray for basil rathbone fans . fantastic
this is one of my favorite scary movies . i liked the story line and wish they would make a sequel to it . very reasonably priced with quick delivery .
another tim allen classic . this film has the perfect mix of funny , sad , and serious . a great film for all ages .
it is a nice movie with a great message . i wish the acting and directing would have been better , but the message is solid .
this is a great movie . i watched it on television and bought it to have in our collection . it has a great story line and is very good .
this series is much better than the previous one [ # 1 ] . the storylines are more dramatic and the acting is excellent
this is one for the your classic collection . loads of laughs throughout the entire movie . this has to be one bill murray 's best .
a wonderful , nostalgic look at this history of american music . i enjoyed it thoroughly and can watch it over and over again .
i loved this when i was growing up and i was so happy to find it so i can now share it with my granddaughter -- who loves it as well .
i love this one . i did not like the prior actor in the last spider man movies . i would recommend .
if you like to laugh and like scary movies this one is for you . the best scene is any scene with charlie sheen . he is a comic genius
this film is full of action and filmed well , great plot and full of well done cgi . i you want excitement watch this film .
what is to be said about a classic like this other than it stands the test of time , all great films do : - )
great for any jet li fan . pure action yet funny too . i had this on vhs so i decided to get it on dvd .
this tv series was only on two seasons . but i liked it a lot . glad to get to add to my video collection . would recommend .
i 'm certainly glad i bought this because the extended version ca n't be rented anywhere . this movie is a musical , a tragedy , a comedy , and a bit of a masterpiece .
i really enjoyed watching madea 's neighbors from hell and madea - is always laugh out loud funny ! my 9 year old daughter loved it .
i watched this movie a long time ago , i loved then and i love it now . the writing on the box my be chinese by not the movie !
i do n't particularly care for all the sequels in the land before time series . some stand out , both the story and the music . this is a good one , i liked it !
my grandson just loves to watch underdog do his stuff , and he learns alot from this movie . like dogs do n't really fly and have the strength that underdog has . great movie !
i was really looking forward to seeing this movie then when watching it . i was truly disappointed with this movie
i love that they are all playing themselves ! everyone in this movie has a classic line ! this is great for anyone who likes anything they have been in !
i have viewed each one of the trilogy i would recommend this to anyone it kept me interested all the way through
this movie is a great drama that teaches us to be ourselves and that each of us is beautiful in our own way .
if you liked this series on tv , my husband loved it , he use to watch it with his dad , so brought back great memories for him and a great price
i remember going to see this movie with my mom and brother as a kid . it really brings back terrific memories . it was always my brother 's and my favorite !
my mom absolutely loves the movie gone with the wind and absolutely had to have it on dvd so she could watch it whenever she wanted to . she has really enjoyed this dvd .
bought season 1 & 2 as the tv series were very entertaining back in the 60 's wish they were like that now are more seasons going to be released very very entertaining . recommend the series loved it
i am in the forth season , and if you like this type movie , then the unit is a must to watch .
i thought this was going to be a fun movie with interesting interaction between bruce willis and bill murray , instead it turned out to be a movie on badly raised children doing stupid dangerous things .
i found this in the garbage . i watched 10 minutes . i threw it back in the trash .
this is a great series . my wife and i have watched every episode . much better the morse which was boring .
fun to watch - adult humor throughout . i can remember seeing this as a child , and as i watch as an adult , there is a whole level of humor and wit that i missed years ago .
typical x-files adventures . i like this series better than any of the & # 34 ; reality & # 34 ; shows on tv now . recommended for any x-files buffs .
great family movie full of fun , adventure , and outstanding 3d ! visual experience is great as well as the fun storyline with fantastic effects !
a worthy sequel to the original with some added characters that enhanced the series . robert downey plays the main character with just the right amount of dry humor .
i ordered this for some else as well . they watched the dvd and was very happy with the quality of it . thanks for the prompt service .
not at all what i expected with all the hype around this movie ... .. the story line is pretty thin ... ...
i liked the first movie , but i honestly think this 2nd movie is better . it moved really fast and kept my attention . close enough to the book to make me happy .
this movie really moved me . made me sad , smile , appreciate what i have & love . everyone should see this . it was in excellent condition & arrived when promised .
love , love , love it ! i 'm totally addicted to this show ! it will be one long summer as we wait for it 's return !
always like these movies i have all of these movies they have action adventure and lots of zombies also cool special effects .
this is an excellent movie . sally field once again demonstrates what a great actress she is . i recommend it !
this is my favorite movie . i never get tired of watching it . the movie arrived on time and works great . i would make another purchase from this seller .
i believe she now has a spongebob for every season of the year and every holiday . they are wonderful books and great quality . thank you
how do you rate perfection , you do n't you just watch and listen . it was worth adding to my collection . wish they would do another project together .
this is an amazing piece of military history . read it over and over . by the way , the movie did n't even tell half the story .
because there were so many jokes and sight gags that went by so quickly , i 'd definitely watch again and maybe again .
i always enjoyed the original movie as a kid . jim carey really made this movie remarkable . a great family christmas movie .
as a fan of 1950 - 60 ` s horror movies i really enjoyed seeing this one again . the best science fiction and horror movies were filmed in black and white .
i love everything about this movie . great acting . great story line . it is written so well . i am so glad to have my own copy of it .
i hope there is a season 2. very interesting stories they are addicting . i will definitely look for a season 2 and beyond !
it was okay i watched all of it and hoped for the happy ending it had . the supporting people were good .
at first the kids did not want to watch this but once the show was on they could n't get enough .
i will not sit alone and watch this tape again , there is just no way form or person can make me it was wonderfull
let 's face it , there is n't a series that lives up to this one ! ! love it and will watch it many more times ! ! !
very prompt ! got it just before i needed it . i now have the series ! love it ; love it ; love it ; love it !
this is fun ! just be sure not to have too small of kids around , as some of the subjects are for adults only .
this is a great comedy . i 'd watch it again and i 'm sure enjoy it over over again . really cute , recommend this movie .
the simpsons are funny . the product was cheap and it came in great time . i did n't have to wait long at all .
very good movie from disney . watched this when i was younger and is still a classic . a lot of big name actors as well .
the trailers for this this movie ( and many others ) should have been the ones to win anything ( if there was something to win ) .
i love the period clothing but did n't know it was a musical . i thought this film would 've been more dramatic and with suspense . i was bored with it and finish watching the movie .
deeper character development and more complicated situations makes this the best season of s & amp ; c ... do n't miss it !
so glad i was able to purchase a combo pack of these two great movies ! one of the best purchases i have ever made !
finished up my collection so far of the movies , and worked great . arrived in timely fashion . was wrapped and new . no scratches .
this movie is great and fun and i doubt it would happen in real life but it is hilarious ! i recommend it .
this film has something for everyone . great music , great story line , funny scenes . we 've watched it several times and love it every time .
i was surprised at how good this movie was because as part was way different then his past roles , but he did great !
nothing but fantastic . this movie has got to be on the top seller list . the color is great and the transfer to bluray is great .
to those of you who like it , more power to ya . i found it just silly ... i actually fell asleep during it .
it is just as funny as the first season , these four ladies together are so incredible i wish it was on longer .
very is a funny program -- i use to watch it on tv when i was a kid
katherine hepburn and humphrey bogart work a wonderful chemistry under less than ideal conditions . real star quality acting that stands the test of time .
this movie makes fun of all other movies about teens and kids in high school . it 's funny . if you like making fun of stuff you 'll love this .
this was a very clever movie and you had no idea what was going to happen . the two lead actors did a great job . watch this one . you will be pleased .
i did not get to see this tour when it was going on . if you like journey you will really like this it is a really good concert .
words can not describe how terrible this movie is , it made absolutely no sense at all . bad acting , bad story line just pathetic , that 's all i have to say .
delightful , engaging , suspenseful , hilarious , and touching . loved & # 34 ; holes ! & # 34 ; for kids , adults , and especially for teens . not for children under 8 or so .
this movie had plenty of laughs , not terrible acting and an ok story line . better than i expected from the previews .
this movie was amazing ! ! ! the first time i saw it i was scared stiff afterwards , i could n't sleep ! !
people kept telling me i had to see this show . i do n't have the channel it 's on so i decided to watch it from here . it 's really great and riveting
my granddaughter is more into this than i am , but she is thrilled with it and said it was just what she wanted .
arrived quickly and great packaging . i am in the process of replacing all my vhs tapes and going digital . i think the disc format is the best .
we loved it ! ! very fun and entertaining ! jeff is very talented , and his puppets take on a life of their own ! you wo n't be disappointed !
a lil bit of swearing in it and it has a nice story would recomend this one for kids !
this is the original frank oz directed , british version and is hilarious . a lot of fun to watch . way better than the remake version .
this movie is good have good action and very good special effect if u like witch craft u will enjoy
good movie . great story line . have enjoyed watching this movie . have always enjoyed christmas stories , so it is to like .
i bought the set for my husband he loves this show . now he can watch them whenever he wants to .
i can not tell you how on the mark this movie is , on so many levels - it 's almost depressing . it 's amazing the usa is even in business .
it does seem rather dated and of course it is . it was good if you like second world movies and it seems quite true to life at the time .
i loved the show when it aired on tv . i was very pleased about the quality of the dvd ' s .
this is great entertainment for my grandsons . they have a huge collection of thomas the train sets and the movie is another way to entertain them for a fun change .
i 'm glad i ordered this before the show closed . it has some great characters which have carried forward well into another program when the star left .
i enjoyed this informative documentary of the beginning of the usa . i think it was very well done and have watched it a couple of times and i am sure i will watch it again .
i love buying dvds with the making of included , this movie is great and a lot of fun to watch for all ages
i really liked this movie ... i can see why it was nominated for an oscar ! great job , ben ! a must see !
toy story 3 , this is the greatest story , the best one yet . this dvd was used as a gift , the grandkids really love it .
my brother had never seen it so we watched when he came for a visit ... well done , sick , and gross , but classic ...
scream started it off . love this movie . from the storyline to characters , a different twist . ghost face killer is awesome .
i guess it 's old enough to be a classic . this one has always made me laugh . if you like laughs , buy it .
i watched this in theater a few years back . not as good as i remembered , but still a good flick to watch . would recommend it .
wonderful movie . this is my favorite version . better than the one with angela l. nice story line and beautiful scenery .
this movie is innocent , silly , and funny . for the child in everyone , it 's the best modern movie . i only wish i had seen it in theaters .
dexter is just one of those shows that get 's better with time . this is a wonderful season with a lot of plot twists and surprises .
good cast , good story , great effects . good to watch in order ... ... .. ... ... ... . ... . ... ... ..
john adams is absolutely one of the best historical miniseries ever made . this is a must for any one who likes historical documentaries .
any series i like , i try to buy the dvd of a full season of that series . i really like the first season so far plan to get more seasons as they go along .
excellent movies , love having the set and love the way it is presented you can display as a book or keep it displayed with the movies .
loved it ! a great film , and very chilling . very interested to know if they will make a part 2 to this
i like how it went back and forth in time and tied the hole story together . another great family movie .
we have this on vcr but it started to drag so we went for the dvd , obviously we like the movie and the actors .
i watched all of the spiderman movies when they came out . this one , is a lot better than those . andrew garfield is an amazing actor . it is definitely worth buying !
i was very impressed with these movies and it was nice to see a good clean movie for once ! it would be nice to see movie clean movies made
the product was wonderful , as always . we always get good movies from amazon.com , and their sellers . we wo n't go anywhere else .
awesome movie . got it for my mother for christmas . sealed and in excellent condition . thank you for such a deal
loved this movie ... ... yes , it makes you laugh and it makes you cry . very touching story ... ... .great chemistry with the actors too . loved it !
a novel and interesting idea with a very poor execution . mainly a gore fest with no substance and no attempt to actually fit the story into the times it tells of .
this is one of those beautiful christmas concerts i 've ever seen . i first caught it on pbs this year and knew i had to buy the dvd for my christmas collection .
worth the price for ernest goes to africa and army . the other stuff is rather pointless . i did n't think even the movies were as good as some of his others .
i just love mark wahlberg and i like most of his movies . i love stories based on real life challenges .
lot 's of action and all the actors are very good . nice couple of hours of entertainment for an lazy afternoon .
i loved everything about this product . it 's just said that it ended . and i am so going to recommend you and the product
my kids really like this movie and they also like the reference to some of the video games they play . the message was good too . i really thought it was heartwarming !
i always liked this movie with 'the rock ' in this - too bad they did n't make another movie out of this with him in it !
this film is a reminder of what was like back in the 70 's . the music was good , but you could tell that the actors were new . wonder what they are up to today ?
full and action and i thought robert downey jr was excellent ... i really thought downey did an excellent job as iron man
could watch this movie all day long what a treasure every child should see this movie ! ! great lessons and how families should love each other !
i dont know what to say but its a true classic . also it has a nice list of special features that put this classic film experience right back into the theater .
this movie is a guilty pleasure for me . i never get tired of the performances , and i love the twist at the end .
what else can be said about this movie . good story , good music , good animation . my only wish ... it was available in 3d blu ray format
love this story ! i 'm not one for part 2 's , but the writers pull it off here . bringing the cast back was essential . hardly miss kirk douglas at all . beautiful cinematography too .
i still have quite a few more to go , until i have all of the collection complete . love the show , and it was in perfect condition !
i loved the movie as my son had told me that the movie was very good . i look forward to the next movie
yet confusing but amazing ! this movie has a huge twist but at the same time a scary touch to it !
a big fan of the series glad to have it on dvd always enjoyed the plots and sets they had back in that era .
typical scooby doo , fun around halloween time or any time . it is the good old scooby doo , not the newer ones .
i can not understand why they did not continue to produce this excellent series into more episodes and seasons . absolutely great acting and story lines .
this movie is one of my favorites by far . the story and cinematography are tops with me . a must see .
this is a wonderful series - i would love to go on but i need region one - i need usa version - please
i got this to watch with my niece because she loves tinkerbell . it was cute and she really loved it .
a must have for all star war fans . had to get this with the original star war series . completed my star wars collection .
for anyone over 12 this movie should be fine ; however the imagery presented to anyone younger will most likely give them nightmares for a very long time .
this was a good movie . it is not a high budget film , but it definitely a great message . this is a christian movie and depicts the end times .
poor quality film , hard to watch . acting not that good ; dubbed audio just makes it worse to watch . rent something else !
very good well worth a watch good plot and good acting would recommend to any one who likes monster movies
how nice to watch an happy film from beginning to end . it is full of great performances from all of the stars in it .
i love the whole series and ca n't wait for the two remaining films . thank you for making them available to me .
watched this with my grandkids and we were all disappointed that there was n't more holiday content . we were in the christmas mood and wanted a christmas movie .
did n't expect it to be `` dubbed '' but still good if you like the old classics .
i liked this movie , but i enjoyed the book alot more . they both played their roles really well , but it was kind of boring at times to me .
this movie was good and well written . the characters and storyline was unique . the actors did a great job . overall a good movie .
good show . elmo 's holiday christmas is better , but this is a nice change to watch for the holidays this year .
fun movie and great watching but i still prefer the orginal over the new movie .
loved this movie , took forever to get here , but worth the wait ! loved the twists and turns , but in the end everyone was where they needed to be .
my husband is more into than the kids . they all like the action , and humor . the story lines are great . never the same story .
this film has it all and i mean it all . porn , gore , horror , what more do you want for entertainment . great film .
i think this remake of the series was very good . my family enjoyed the movie and johnny depp did a fine job .
james garner is a bit unpredictable & also funny i loved the movie & needed another copy , so i bought this one
i bought the for my best friend and he watches it almost everyday now , now its nothing but references from this movie ! !
looking back on this early james bond piece , i am amazed that the series has continued to inspire people . i found the work badly edited , the audio was a joke , and acting stiff .
better than the 1st season , which set up the story . too bad it did n't get to go all 5 years . that would be really interesting .
i ca n't imagine how this stupid film won the oscar ! at least the dog played an excellent part . he should have won an oscar ! ! !
i would recommend this movie to any and every tyler perry fan ! a different movie for him ! ! i love it !
i have been a simply red fan for years and some far i 've gotten all their works on cd and now on dvd , keep up great work .
solid writing . solid acting . believable storylines . i have watched all 4 seasons in less than a month and now i do n't know what to do .
anytime i need to be in a better mood , this is my go to movie . i can just about say it word for word , but still laugh & cry every time ! !
very good series and must see if you liked the first season . they should make a third .
great show . if you are a fan , owning all the seasons is necessary . each season get 's better and better in my opinion .
ordered this for a gift for my daughter and granddaughter and they loved it . would recommend this to anyone interested !
i still have to practice a little bit more , but i think is a good routine . it really make me sweat !
the movie surprised me . i did not expect it to be so good . i really enjoy this movie and recommend it .
this is one of my favorite steve martin movies . i love it . the product was in great condition , and i am excited to have it .
the 3d version makes all the difference in viewing this movie . i enjoyed that aspect . it is a good movie for history buffs .
it is a great movie . my child loved it and is watching it more all the time . it is a good movie to add to your movies at home . we love it at my house .
bought this for my daughter who is a big `` rent '' fan - now she knows i 'm the best mom ever ...
i had never seen this movie , but everyone told me it was good . i finally was able to get it and i enjoyed it . glad to have it in my tom hanks collection .
i love this movie . one of my favorite movies . it makes me laugh so much . watch it all the time .
i really love the first movie with drew in it but not so much th second movie it really does n't follow the first one .
what a beautiful film . gorgeous cinematography . well told story with just enough funny bits to keep it fun . probably one i 'd watch again and again . do n't hesitate , this is a winner .
very good graphics . a more realistic storyline version of the multiple attempts of the comic book epic . very good movie !
while the story was so-so , the cg was too much and took away from the movie . did n't like it much .
well , what more can be said ? it 's steven seagal , doing what he does the very best ... taking names and kicking butt ! ! !
this is a christmas tradition ! its awesome from the story , visuals , music and feeling you get from it . if you have n't seen this , then you are missing out : )
it was a refreshing movie . simple story line . cute acting . i just enjoyed a simple movie with a happy ending .
the disc came with no scratches and plays perfectly . it also came like the picture is & love the movie .
if you have never seen this movie , you have to see it . very good story . good acting by helen and matthew . picture quality and sound is great !
great show , great cast , great stories and very well written . as good as law and order ! i would highly recommend !
two actors doing a very good job in an interesting story line . the dialogue was intelligent and kept my interest throughout . a man and woman in a very erotic situation portrayed in a subtle but sexy way .
had to replace this one - gave it to a friend and decided to get again to have my steven seagal collection complete again .
i personally love sci-fi with action and adventure . this has lots of action but lacks the adventure . overall , this is a good watch .
i had not heard of this movie before - the movie was very good and suspenseful ! i would recommend it to all .
what a spin on the actual story . i love it , such a great ending . i knew that the wolf was n't all bad . situations could make a wolf out of the best of us .
this movie is also a keeper ! this is a true story of one very brave woman ! buy it before all of the copies are gone !
this movie was great . i love the acting the singing . i watch it over and over . love it . buy it wo n't regret .
this is true british humor at its best . after watching this buy the newest movie for sure to keep the humor going .
worth having amazon prime just for the ability to watch this series again . not for the kids but realistic for adults .
i have written this review 3 times in the last 2 years ... can this please be the last time ? `` it was a gift . ''
this gets a five star ... my grandaughter loves this shop ... requested it for christmas ... if she loves it ... i love giving it to her ...
apart from being a jennifer garner fan , all the other actors are sooo good too in this movie ! ! ! excellent writing and acting and soundtrack too .
a beautiful movie with a decent story , but something was missing that kept it from being great . i liked father and son working together .
i keep recording it when it comes on television . by having my own copy , i can see it whenever i want !
kids love this movie . the movie came before christmas and my daughter was so excited to find it in her stocking .
love it love it . this movie is a true classic . one of my go to movies of all times . highly recommend purchasing it .
this was just as funny as i expected it to be ! i loved it - i laughed so much while watching . glad i bought it !
this is one of our favorite movies and is especially beautiful in blu ray . i would be satisfied with either the theatrical version or the director 's cut .
never watch this movie . you will waste years off your life and wish very badly to suck them back . i mean , luke perry . do we need to say anything else here ?
my friend 's kid bought this on my kindle fire before i realized it so i watched it . very entertaining especially if you love the despicable me movies .
did n't like this one bit . only saving grace was that tom was in it . story was contrived and a little stupid . do n't even bother with it .
would recommend this to any young girls and is just another great walt disney movie - any body would like it
its an old classic and a favourite too . great movie like many one i have ordered from amazon , have not been disappointed .
season 2 coming to dvd . may i say this is a pleasant surprise , considering how many good shows never get past the 1st season on dvd .
not great but not bad . was n't my favorite but kept me entertained on a boring night at home . rent it only . dont buy
the dry humor makes this movie enjoyable . good for a quiet night at home . the plot finally comes around once you become used to listening to their efforts to speak as in the old english day .
i like this move it has family fun i cant wait tell it comes in dvd i love this move
my daughters and i ca n't get through the holidays without seeing this all time favorite and classic ! i recommend it for all ages .
i have a dvd of this film and it is better than this bluray ! picture quality of this film is very bad ! dont buy this !
what can i say . the music is perfect , the supporting cast spot on and the added bonus of the trailer all combine to make this a must have for don knotts fans .
it was funny . but not as good as the first one . still found it to be entertaining . the parts that are funny , are really funny
this was so depressing and so violent i could n't stand to watch the whole thing . very sorry i rented it .
i had to introduce my family to this great , epic story ! i wanted the blu-ray for the best presentation available !
pretty good , a bit silly but i am sure kids really like it . now i have to add works to meet the minimum .
this movie is always a favorite , not a kid movie . i loved it so much that after i received the movie i realized i had already purchased it some other time .
received this set in a timely manner . am enjoying watching these stories . some i figured out and some i did n't . would recommend this series .
i purchased this dvd set for my daughter so she could catch up on the last season . soon she will no longer be `` lost '' about lost !
it made me think about the human body and the changes that we take for granted . one day at a time
well made world war 11 action series . they had many diverse and interesting plot lines .
both my daughter and my son love to watch this mickey movie ! we have watched it about three times a week since christmas !
we remembered this series being so much better than it was . guess it did n't stand the test of time . kids were a little bored with it .
it 's a lot of politics in this episode . should be worthy one 's time of watching it if you are into politics .
excellent movie . i love sandra bullock and nicole kidman in this film . powerful , yet opposite in their abilities . truly enjoyed it .
i do n't watch tv normally ... but this series has captured me . looking forward to next season ... wish there were n't so many months between them !
i watched this just to see if robert deniro could pull off a character set in a different time . he did . i did n't like the ending though . i guess i like happier endings .
if you have n't seen it , it 's very good . funny , sentimental . the little girl in it is the reason to watch it .
i saw this as a play and as a movie . it is a funny , and yet sad story . dolly is such a hoot .
more creative with each episode these people are the greatest at what they do i can not wait to watch each show
this is one of my favorite series . lots of action , this is very well done . there are four in the series .
this movie was entertaining and it made me think . there were several storylines happening at once - and all were interesting . definitely worth watching .
great love story ! and i love the era when this movie was made . i love movies that make feel the emotion . great movie .
i think that say 's it all a big waste of money i wish i never bought it i sold it to buy back 's
i am a big fan of godzilla and was happy to find these dvds . great price and fast shipping .
just an entertaining western movie . always was a henry fonda fan . this movie would not make it today since there is not a lot of sex , violence and vulgar language .
ca n't go wrong with & # 34 ; the office & # 34 ; . this season was a little weak , but a must have for fans who are getting the entire series .
a neat twist in the story line but not up to the level of the first two in the series . worth seeing , yes . worth paying for ... well , you decide that .
i 'm a tom selleck fan so far all of the movies i have seen him in i liked , this one did n't disappoint .
if you do n't watch it expecting it to be related to the other halloween movies , it 's ok. it has nothing to do with any of the other halloween movies .
when i saw this at 10 years old , i absolutely loved it . it was one of my favorite books as a child , and the movie is even better . i would recommend it to anyone .
i 've seen it before - well worth a second watch . mel gibson in one of his better performances . good buy !
this purchase had been a long time coming . i 'm glad i decided to buy on amazon . it was affordable and the seller was very prompt . thanks ! ! ! ! ! !
i especially liked the commentaries , which talked about the history of the two versions of the film .
i thought this movie was exactly what it was made for . a 13 year old girl . did n't watch it again .
i was very happy with this item and i loved everything about the seller and would definitely buy from them again .
overall a good simple thriller with a few twist and turns kept me entertained . not overly complicated but very entertaining .
i guess i was expecting another story like the first one . but this did hold my attention and that 's saying a lot .
i 'm not sure if i liked this or not . took me too long to read i like to understand things better than i did .
this was a gift for a friend and he was delighted with the movie as he had never seen it .
my sister and i are always waiting for the older musicals to come out in blu ray . this is a delight .
entertained the whole family ! wish there were more movies that mom , dad , and kids could all enjoy . good clean fun !
this was a good , low budget movie worth renting . if you like the genre then i think you wont be disappointed .
i love any movie with kristen stewart in it . this was an amazing movie over all . i really enjoyed it .
we had this one on a tape for years and we thought it was funny enough to replace it with a dvd .
good workouts , again that can be done in a shorter amount of time , but you will see results if you are consistent with them .
this was a very good movie , i bought it because i heard good reviews on it and i was not disappointed . i would recommend purchasing it to anyone who asked .
this movie will keep you on the edge of your seat , a lot of magic and suspense , hugh and christian great performance .
love watching this show . love being able to see it anytime now and love it . i love this show too much
loving to watch the classic season of a great show to show our family and the laughs all over again
my husband liked this movie when it came out so getting it for him was a treat . we took our time watching it ( over 3 nights ) even though it was hard to stop .
a great series for any sherlock fan . wish they did more than 4 shows . great watching with great writing . waiting now for season 4 .
the third season in a great show that shows just because your a genius does n't mean that your not an idiot .
what bond movies used to be and had lost . of course daniel craig has helped bring that back ! but great flick !
i absolutely love morse ! i ca n't wait for more episodes . love the plots and when i think i know who did it ... wrong ! great show !
couldnt believe the price ! i bought it and added it to my shelf of scary movies
i actually like it a lot more action is awsome ninja is something i really enjoy . the sword and everything .
at first appearance the movies shown appear mediocre , but the first four discs which i have watched so far are quite acceptable
one of the great biblical movies , on dvd it should be presented in it 's original widescreen format .
i already owned the dvd , and just bought this as part of my effort to upgrade my video library to blu-ray quality .
i watched this movie when my son was grade school aged . i surprised him with it for christmas and it brought back a lot of memories .
this movie was awesome , awesome , awesome , full of action and drama at every turn , this is one for the dvd collection to watch over and over again .
i thoroughly enjoyed this film . the images were incredible , beautiful in fact . the story was smart and engaging . a a great edition to the christmas genre .
this is another classic steve martin film . michael caine is great as well . transfer quality on the blu-ray is great . not a lot of extras , but that 's never been important to me personally .
my daughter loved tarzan , so i bought this dvd . poor sequel , bad plot , not at all i was expecting . do n't waste your money .
i thought that this was a great family movie . i thought it was funny in parts and the kids loved it.i will buy this on blu-ray after seeing this . the boys loved this
good movie . lots of action . wish they would have made it clearer that the two main characters had actually become more friend like than it did but it was still very entertaining .
i saw this movie on life time movie channel and was pleasantly surprised at how good the movie really was . the acting was great and the movie did keep my interest until the very end .
i hate that people say he 's a bad actor , well apparently audiences do n't think so or he still would n't be getting lead roles ! give the people what they want ! keanu rocks !
another great & # 34 ; old & # 34 ; movie . i remember seeing it in the theatre and could n't believe the beginning scenes . i 'm a huge robert redford fan .
there are some people who play their roles in a set fashion -- and schwarzenegger is one of those . too much violence and blood for the pg set & # 8230 ; and me .
overall it was a good movie ; however , there was n't as many scary parts as i had expected there to be .
i had forgotten what a great movie this is . i am glad i purchased it . the watch bear is my favorite character .
great movie good download would recommend it you really need to watch the first one if you have not already in order to understand the 2nd
i 'd heard it was n't good , so my expectation level was low . but i thought it better than the first one .
i have to say that this exceeded my expectations . the footage and the sound is incredible . high quality video too .
this movie is the back bone of paul walker history in the story , need to have this movie to complete the whole story , if you like fast five , you would like this one .
it was ok. entertaining , a bit slow , and very sad , but the actors were great !
i was n't to thrilled with this movie . it had a lot of unnecessary swearing and ended up being very dumb and corny .
i loved this movie . it was a great suspenseful horror movie . it kept my interest and i was very surprised by the ending . worth watching .
it 's a okay movie . not worth buying , but i guess it is a nice movie to watch at least once .
of all adaptations of a christmas carol , this is the best one . george c. scott is the perfect scrooge .
i always enjoyed this show when it was on . it 's great to have it on dvd now . it came promptly after being ordered .
do not do not do not do not waste your money on this awful movie . they obviously had no budget .
i like this move my husband loves it . it is sweet and heartwarming . nice movie to watch for the holidays
well worth the price . this was excellent . the movie is as greats . movie arrived promptly and was in brand new condition . very sweet story . this was adorable .
good movie my mom loved it , and it was for mothers day so mission accomplished : ) i saw it long ago and still just as good : )

was very surprised , it was very good . you can go wrong on this i wish it was in blue ray
i have been buying this tv series for awhile , i am finally getting close to having the complete series and will be glad .
like the movie worth the watch really can '' t say much more it 's a good movie person sent it very quick ; y

ive always loved this movie because its such a great story and im so glad i have it in blu ray now !
this was a christmas gift for my husband . he really enjoyed it but it is a very old movie . john wayne is very young in this movie .
i ordered this for my grandaughter . i have had the complete series for quite sometime and she fell in love with the series .
love to watch this film over and over . excellent chemistry between the lead actors . great story to watch . wish more films like this were made .
with disney packaging their movies with a digital copy and a dvd , this is a value that can not be beat .
not as good as the other ones . kind of slow paced . but my son wanted the series . the collection of all the terminator movies .
whats not to like about clint eastwood ! all his movies are good entertainment for adults but not small children .
after watching , you ask yourself , did this really happen ? frightening . christopher walken is always worth watching .
my husband and i look at this movie all the time , it is a great movie thank you so much
i liked it well enough . not the best ever but definitely one of the better movies to come out in recent years .
it came in great condition and on time . it is a wonderful classic that the whole family can sit down and watch over and over again .
it looked like a good horse movie.it is a good family movie , with a good theme and plot and a happy ending . oh yea ! yes i would recommend it !
this is one of my favorite war movies . it shows the great struggle in wwii , how the war changed from this point on . from this point on germany goes down hill .
i gave it 5 stars because i love sci-fi of all sorts . this show has all the elements of it , action adventure imagination . if you really like sci-fi you will love this one .
i have become really fond of this series , and the events that take place in it . i was hoping for more , but it was short lived .
this is a great romance movie . my wife and i have watched this movie more than once . i would recommend this movie .
i loved this movie ! it was hilarious and kept my grandchildren 's interest until it was over which is hard to do !
i love this show ! ! it is amazing , it is another take of robin and i like it ! ! even though it is three seasons it is still a good show to watch
this should be rated pg-13 , it is gross and nonsense . honestly , i would n't suggest anyone at any age watch it .
another great movie for my musicals collection . love the music in this one . lighthearted movie and great for all ages .
very good movie . the visual was awesome for when this was made . a well done movie . i would tell others about it .
excellent movie . i could n't wait to watch it . it brought back sweet memories of my younger days . my daughter is a fan as well .
great makeup effects . good story line with some twists . i thoroughly enjoyed . johnny depp is really good .
it is my fault but i wanted a movie not a documentary . if you like documentaries then you will probably like it . i do n't care for them personally . i had hoped for so much more .
another great movie by denzel . i throughly enjoy watching his movies and character . he is the best i have seen
another classic i just had to get ! love it and it came quick !
a great movie - was recommended this by a friend so i just found it and bought it . good story - i enjoyed it .
never get tired of watching this movie or the whole series . the movie is well written and produced and acting could n't be better .
the movie was just ok , nothing so great about it , would not want to see it again , and would tell my friends save the money
i am out of touch with what is on tv but i found 24 on amazon prime and ca n't seem to turn it off it is sooo good .
this was a pretty good movie , more than i was expecting . i just do n't like the ending that much but over all it was decent for a dark movie type .
watching this through with the kids ( under 10 ) . they are enthralled and it holds my attention as well . different and fun .
great movie ( one of my all time favorites ) , blu-ray is a bit soft but still ok considering the movie is a bit dated .
i bought this dvd because the film sounded so interesting & it got great reviews . they were right . it was fantastic .
my daughter and i needed a movie and this one was pretty good . i did n't think i would like it and it was actually a decent action type movie . i was pleasantly surprised .
still enjoying the series . great cast , characters and writing , and story line . i wish there were more episodes in a season !
as someone who likes all kinds of movies , i thought that this selection would be a worthwhile watch . it was not finished .
this is an average movie not really exciting or anything , but pretty decent story line it was worth the money i paid .
just think if something like that actually happened ? i liked watching it and the action was very good.i will be looking for more of these types .
the cast of frasier was great and seemed to always click with each other . i wish frasier and cheers could have gone on forever .
it 's all good to watch star trek ... .. this stuff never gets old . reruns you can always watch a get things you missed the first time you watch
i loved it , i 've saw one and two . definately a must have for a horror fan .
i had high hopes for this movie , but i was slightly disappointed . i think all the good parts were shown in the previews . it seemed to be exceptionally long .
this movie was nice to put in and kick back . love the story . the dvd case was average , not much to complain about .
james cagney was at his best in this one ( i do n't think i ever saw a movie of his that i did n't like ! i ca n't wait to view it again .
liam neeson is a great actor . i love all his movies and this one is a must see . lots of action , and suspense ... great
3d effects are mainly still shots , i was disappointed . i am a sucker for war movies . i have some of the items shown in the movie .
this movie is very touching . friend told me that it was good and he was right . i had to buy it . great movie ! !
this movie is fun and funny . my kids love it and i thought it was great too . jack black was funny and did a really good job .
the soundtrack of this movie is great . the story is fun and the scenery is wonderful . the movie was a big hit in its day , and it still holds up .
i bought this movie because i like musicals and this movie is a classic musical . i will keep it forever
a excellent thriller movie . makes one not want to leave their seat . you would be surprised of the outcome . one must see the movie .
although i had seen this in the movies , i still wanted to own a copy for myself and my friends , it is one of mel brooks best ! !
i saw this movie when it first came out , so very , very funny ! billy crystal and meg ryan are superb in it .
i loved the series am very pleased that it was finally released to dvd . hopefully more old - really great series will become available on dvd in the future
save your time and money , do something else than buying or even rent this movie . pure waste of time . why ca n't we give zero star , because this one really deserve it .
do n't understand why this movie did n't win best picture of the year . is there nothing jennifer can do ? what a great actress . i just loved this movie and i know you will too .
you had to follow the story really close as it jumps a lot . it was an okay movie , to long with to many jumps
well written , good acting , great costumes and sets . entertaining to watch . what more is necessary to say i ask you .
truly one the the best dramatic movies ever made and wonderfully restored by warner 's . keep up the great work on your oldies .
why does amazon take videos off so one can not watch or rent them . i was so looking forward to renting this for my kids .
as always , csi is awesome . love it and all that good stuff .
a great show that is well worth buying . i have them all so far and ca n't wait for the rest to be released . definitely one of the all time greats .
how can you go wrong with this cast ? ! need i say more ... action , comedy , etc loved it ! ! this movie had it all .
this movie is just an ok movie . didnt like how it ended though . kinda made me mad at what happened , brought me to wondering what the point of the movie was in the first place
this movie starts out funny and ends on a serious note . a different take on what an angel might be like .
i 've seen the theater version but not the extended yet . ordered as a gift for christmas and i am excited to watch on the new big screen .
we love the middle . we started watching it towards the end of the 3 season . we wanted to view the previous seasons for a little more information . love it .
this was recommended to me and i had no idea what i was getting into . not quite sure if i liked it enough to get season 2
i give 5 stars because i like the show . the costumes are perfect . the dialog is great , and the morals depicted are good for all audiences . please , pbs , more of the same !
a great remake from the original ! eventually will purchase it ! i hope everyone gets a chance to see it also !
what can i say ? it has the duke , jimmy stewart and lee marvin as a really evil villian ! what more do you want ?
if i could give this video a minus 5 , i would . bad script and bad acting combined with an obvious low production budget make this one of the worst videos i have ever watched .
i bought this for my three year old son for christmas . he absolutely loves them . we watch them over and over . very good purchase .
what more can you expect with hd quality . . . bright colors , clarity ! i got it all and am 100 % happy with it . no complaints here !
my daughter got this movie for christmas and she loves it ! we saw it in theaters and waited for the price to go down before purchasing . a great price and came quickly .
i like action movies and will smith and sci fi settings . i thought this movie would be geared a little differently and it seemed like will smith made this as a vehicle for his son 's acting career .
they just keep getting better ... although the story falls off the cliff on this one ... leaves little hope for a future sequel
my aunt wanted this movie for her birthday so i bought it for her , i showed it to her and she told that tis is what she wanted .
we bought these for my parents . they seemed happy to get them and watch very little else on tv . good stories , well acted by a great cast .
these actors must have had a great time making this movie . they all work so well together . love listening to the old songs my dad enjoyed so much . surely brings back a lot of memories .
kind of a mix of war of the worlds , alien mind and stand by me . not deep but highly entertaining .
this group is wonderful . i love the songs they sing and their voices are beautiful to listen to . they put a lot of energy in every song .
the best doctor who ever . you will enjoy all the clear detail of the blu-ray . brings all the extras to you
this film is from the 80s - not the michael moore we know today . it 's worth a watch , but nothing to write home about .
love it ! dry humor , good actors , good period piece . take the time to watch ; i think you 'll agree with me .
too long . the direction of the plot was confusing at times . the scenery , filming , cinematography , and acting were great . this was an overall mediocre movie .
this movie is incredible . i do n't have words to describe it . i was moved from the first time i saw it .
great movies . had a family movie night and these were a total hit . would highly recommend ! my kids wanted to watch them again and again !
my brother wanted this , and i 've heard neither bad nor good from him . he likes humphrey bogart in most movies .
this movie is rather slow and does n't tell how both wesley brothers were married . in this movie , they are still single at the end of the movie . a rather strange take on the wesley brother .
i grew up reading my brothers comic books and thoroughly enjoyed them . so setting the stories come to life on the screen is very . i love the story lines and actors chosen
it was a good movie . lots of action and the scenes were filmed very well . great price , shipped fast . i recomend this movie to anyone .
hooked after watching two shows . so we had to go back and watch it from the start ! ca n't wait till new season !
i love this movie used to watch it on vhs when i was a kid , but sadly the vcr broke so have been getting dvds and it is great thanks
love john wayne . i did n't have this in my collection of john wayne dvd 's . would recommend to anyone who loves john wayne or who loves westerns in general .
i love family and family kind of movies i did not a lot of brothers and sisters i only 1 brother . but i especially like the way they care and love one another .
i really enjoy these movies . there is something old fashioned yet very modern about them . old meets new , and a really great line up of actors .
my little boy loves this show and watched the second season in just a few days . he is already wanting the third season . kids love this show and i would highly recommend it .
a classic 80 's movie in my mind . i throughly enjoyed it . if you do n't like 80 's movies like animal house you probably wont like it .
my grandchildren loves this movie . we are getting ready to watch it now and will again and again . it is great .
i absolutely love the music in this movie and the acting is superb . it is such a good story ! ! ! it 's fantastic ! !
good story , but too much sadness . you get a little bored after you figure out what is going to happen next . but good acting .
love this movie and the kids do too very nice for the family to teach and get close to god a much see !
easily the best film of the entire trilogy , if not the best of all time .
if you like this type of spoof , you will certainly enjoy this one ! pop some popcorn and get ready to laugh !
my friend loves the movie and i got it for him . i did not see it , i only purchased it .
loved it . can not wait for the second and third seasons to be released . why is it taking so long for them to be released ?
this movie pack was a great deal , some movies i have tried to get before , and that made this value pack even better and the price was right , give it a try
this was a good value ... 4 good action films at a great price ... ordered another 4 film collection ... another good value ... great price too .
some people may think this movie is stupid but me i find it funny . watch and see u will like it 2
this is n't the first time i 've seen this movie . it is one of the best movies ever made by mel gibson and the photography is absolutely unbelievable . loved it ! ! ! ! !
seen it on tv when it was first aired and had to have my own copy . could hardly wait until it came out on dvd , now we own it .
love this movie it continues very nicely with the second one . like every part of it was very funny , laugh very hard
i have always liked mark wahlberg movies . good movie , good story , good acting , what more could someone ask for ?
it is n't fair for me to only give this 3 stars since i could n't watch it past the first 20 minutes . i really wanted to watch and like this movie but it was n't for me .
very good acting , starting with george clooney , who is n't a movie star in this film . top-notch script and directing , too .
after watching the first two , i had high expectations but was pretty disappointed . nice special effects , but the movie did not impress me at all ...
i loved this series from beginning to end . the only bad thing about it is that there were only four episodes .
just buy it , add it to your collection , and enjoy the extra content on your own schedule .
this is a really good movie and i would highly recommend it to anyone who loves this genre . great to see arnold and sly together . they were great and the plot was great too .
i luv this movie . i think it 's hilarious . i really like these new romantic comedies that are n't all about falling in love and have some fun behind them .
the seller of this was great . however , the movie is n't how we remembered it . the stories are long and drawn out .
it arrived in perfect condition and shipped fast . you can tell the movie is a lower budget film but it has a good message ! it was good for it 's price .
interesting plot twists and acting , enough action to keep it moving along , and the final twist i honestly did n't see coming . worth a watch .
the bone collector is a great movie , full of action and suspense , but very predictable . denzel of course was awesome in it .
i 've never seen the world like this in a movie before . everything you look at or touch blows up it seems .
if you watched & # 34 ; band of brother & # 34 ; you need to watch this also . the pacific version . this would be worth put in the cinema .
this is the first of the series with bruce willis . great movie , lots of action , violence and language . not for children .
definitely the best terminator of the franchise ! i love the crisp quality of the blu-ray and the fact that it offers different versions of the film ,
this story line was very weak and the movie was mostly boring . i wish it had been better the subject a good one but not developed very well
great movie and a great cast , i had seen it when if first aired . i would recommend watching this movie .
who would have thought john cusack and meg ryan were the voices . i wanted to update my collection from vhs to blue-ray and the price was just right .
not sure if this is typical japanese anime , but it was okay . i 'm not a good judge of this genre , but it held my interest .
love this movie and i 'm not usually a fan of horror at all . great acting all the way . i particularly enjoyed the added features on this special edition .
i love this movie . so entertaining and funny . i ca n't believe how young katherine heigl is in this movie . will certainly watch again and again .
fun and exciting movie with grand camera work and interesting characters . al ages will love this one . smooth directing makes this a joy !
ok , movie could have been better if they got a little more into the story it seems like something was missing , but i liked it .
with two young iron man fans in the house with their own dvd players , it is nice to have the extra discs . the special features are terrific and the blu-ray looks awesome .
one of those rare movies that 's so well done that even though i know the story and the outcome , i 'm on the edge of my seat every time i see it !
its got here a little later then i would like but its all safe and sound i am happy that i have all the movies now
i bought this for my 4 year old grandson ... .. he loves john wayne ... .. so that is why i rated this movie as superior ! !
this movie is really funny . the actors did a great job . a lot of scenes in this movie are really funny . good date movie .
i enjoy this movie . if you are looking for a movie that it is soft and easy to understand . this is a good choice .
it was n't as good as i remembered it . it was interesting however , and worth the small amount of cash i paid for it .
ken burns has done it again . his work is fantastic . highly recommend this dvd . interesting and informative . you will not be disappointed .
this movie is pretty good for it 's time . i really liked it . and i hope you will to i recommend it for everyone . if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
i never knew what was going to happen and the scary scenes which were many were very believable . watch again !
this dvd was purchased to replace my vhs version . it is a good christmas classic that i enjoy watching every december .
i gave 5 stars its the best western i 've seen in a long time . i would recomend this to adults
love johnny depp ! i liked the story line and humor in this flick . ca n't beat johnny in a tim burton movie
love it i 'm a big disney fan and i was so happy to get this movie and enjoy watching it with my family
it was great i just got it and watched it and got to say its 1 of 2 best magic movies i have seen
liam neeson is one good actor . ca n't figure out who the bad guy is until the end . very entertaining but you have to pay attention .
no the quality is n't great and hd tv 's are n't helpful to it , but it is still great fun to rewatch those great stories over and over . highly recommended for fans of this old series .
this has a good story just three parts i wish it was more . it is a cool story and great special effects considering the time .
this is by far one of the most boring movies i have ever seen ! i dont understand what is going on with hollywood , but , wow . just plain boring !
i am a huge fan of the show and realize how silly it is from time to time . but i just love it so so much ! great show
great addition to any collection great dvd special effects and how the movie was made . makes one proud of our country
love the noir feel to this show and the old cars ! this volume is still very well made and the picture and sound of the dvds are great !
maybe it 's just because i did n't read the book , but i thought this movie dragged on and was very boring . but , the special effects seemed cool .
i watched this over a two day period , and was glad i did because there are 6 story lines and you need to pay attention . great visuals . wonderful characters .
we love science fiction so this was perfect for us . we watched it non-stop and can hardly wait for next season !
interesting sherlock holmes perspective . a new and different way to see sherlock holmes and company . dvds , cases and covers are ok .
was surprised , didnt think it would be good , turns out to be very funny , at times nicely goofy . enjoyed , cgi space battle was fantastic .
this was a very funny romantic comedy . it 's older but still very funny . had to also order one for my son .
great movie collection ! it was awesome that it comes with both the theatrical releases for each film plus the directors cuts . classic sci fi suspense movies and the quality is awesome as well !
after watching the first movie and enjoying it very much i looked forward to seeing this one . not disappointed , very enjoyable .
this is an awesome movie . i have watched it a lot and was rolling in laughter . there are some dumb parts but thats what makes it funny
jodie foster is always just awesome ! very different plot , well acted , no one believed her story , good ending ! ! love her movies !
to me , this movie was complicated to follow . the plot was all over the place . did not keep my attention at all . turned it off before it was over . regret buying it .
you 'll love these movies ! ! richard is great in all these movies & you 'll have your favorite & then you 'll enjoy the others too because you have n't seen them in so long ! ! !
these are good dvd 's . no problems with them . arrived when they were suppose to .
this is one of the best movies ever . got to love judi dench ! the story line is wonderful and just to think it was based on a real event .
i like this movie it is very entertaining and keeps your attention . i had to buy this movie when i saw it .
both this movie and the sequel are truly entertaining . i love all the actors and the story is great . highly recommend
i bought this movie for my husband because he loves it , but i did n't realize that it was the rated version . oh well my fault !
every high school student in america should be required to see this . it is history that is told by real people about real events in a fashion that makes war become real .
this movie was good . i enjoyed watching it . well worth the watch . have added to my collection . a must see .
my daughter turned me on to this movie and i was n't disappointed ! it was a little dark , just the way i like a good movie ... simply loved it ! ! ! ! !
reminds me of ... . west side story it was fabulous to me ... this movie is a hidden gem of color music dancing and characters .
who could not like this series . it is so funny . the baby is a hoot and the play on words really funny
a gift for my niece , which she asked for . i did not get to see her use it so my comments are limited .
this series will keep you on the edge of your seat ... the lives of the characters are diverse and interesting . awesome .
love this show . its so funny and cute . just love looking back in time and seeing these good old classics .
i looked for this movie many years after my brother introduced me to it . it is beautifully written and holds the story of love and faith . it 's a real tear jerker .
i am not always into these type of movies , but will stay this one surprised me . liked enough to say i did n't waste my money . sat back and watch a very well done movie .
good movie , but not one you want to watch if you are planning to fly in the near future or there is a thunder storm .
great special effects ( considering there was no cgi when it was made ) , neat costumes and a charming performance by jane fonda .
i really enjoyed this movie it was funny with lots of action and adventure i just love jeff bridges he is a good actor and i do enjoy most of his movies
great christmas movie . very heart warming . this movie is one the entire family will enjoy watching . would recommed this movie for the whole family
another great movie in the series . this one is my twin daughters favorite so far !
talk about a heart-warming , charming tale . i loved this movie . it was well written , super cute , and funny . i highly recommend it .
this movie was as fantastic and great and it just as i remember it when the kids were little . great !
my 4 and 8 year olds love this movie . it was really cheap so it 's going to make a great gift along with the rest of their christmas gifts .
dirty dancing is one of my long time favorites . i love the music and the dancing is awesome ! and patrick swayze is nice looking as a bonus . jennifer grey does a great job also .
i thought the movie was poorly directed and the acting seemed forced . the characters were very cliche . did not care for this movie . i wanted to like it because i love meryl streep .
it was a really good movie . needed more special affects . your typical b movie . no known actors or actress . bye
i loved the movie , it was awesome . i received my dvd in a very timely manner and in great condition . i am very pleased and will look forward to purchasing more dvd 's in the future .
finally , the nanny is on dvd ! i am so excited , it 's so good that this hilarious show is on dvd .
if you like sherlock holmes at all or are a true fan , this is a must . well done and historical .
these are older movies that i have in vhs and totally enjoyed so i purchased to add to my collection of dvd movies .
still wish he would have played the hulk in the avengers movies ! he is a perfect hulk ! plenty of action and love the emotion behind his eyes !
fun movie to watch . good story and good sports action . acting and story good but not great . worth watching this movie .
an old fashioned film with plenty of humour and no violence . the dialogue is very witty .
i think this is an excellent movie . lots of good things to learn about life and love .
got this one for old times sake . doris at her best , rock at his best . very very funny movie . you will laugh or you 're dead .
season 4 is a great continuation of the downton abbey series . if you enjoyed the first 3 seasons then you will enjoy this one too .
i have always loved to watch frasier on tv but i feel that the few first seasons are the best instead of the later seasons .
i never paid much attention to russell brand until i saw this movie . then i decided that i had to have the dvd .
this is a great set of classic movies to watching during the holiday season . a good value for such a variety .
i enjoyed this movie , and it was one of ll cool j 's first to act in . i like his acting ... .
we 've always liked this movie and bought the dvd to replace the vhs tape . it 's a laugh out loud movie .
what 's not to love about these two leads ? ! fun travel movie with great scenes and great interaction between stars . have watched a few times over the years . always entertained .
bette davis fan ! i own most of her movies ! will purchase more for my library ! i share these movies with my friends
another of the classic westerns , always a good plot sometimes ahead of its time . these are characters that we grew up with as children and good to be able to see them again .
i expected more with the big cast but i was disappointed . it was a little funny , a little cute but lacking in almost every category .
really great movie with really great songs . who knew kristen bell could sing . love to watch it fairly often and definitely one to own .
a terrible movie , makes no sense , not worth the price , all reviews that i read have been low rated , i got it because it was cheap . cheap does not always mean good .
the movie for me was a bit of a put down . not near as exciting as i expected it to be . ! disc played , but the other did n't .
i bought this for for actors who were in it . ok script , a bit refreshing , a little different from the usual kids comedy .
this is a very comical movie . it 's a lot of fun to watch with kids especially . one of adam sandler 's best .
if you do n't want to buy the series it is really worth renting , there are some very graphic parts but in all not to bad compared to alot of other shows .
this was a very good movie experience . it was well written and funny . not too unbelievable , similar movies in this genre .
i am an audie fan and this was ok for its time on tv . he was a better actor but tv was not too good yet and did not bring out the best in the actors .
both of these movies are great . i wish they did sequels for adult movies as well as children 's movies . my grandson and i watched them over and over . literally !
did n't like it , we had to order another one to see the movie , we thought this was the movie , so we lost money on it .
this is my son 's favorite show . i was able to purchase it during the holiday season at a terrific price . planned to buy it anyway .
ca n't get enough of elmo ' s world definitely a good buy . would recommend to others shop are looking for saga great elmo dvd
i remember this being funnier when i was a kid . sometimes nostalgia is best left as such the amount of one liners in this is still pretty amazing .
i bought this movie for my sister so i did n't watch it . but it arrived quickly and my sister loves it .
i got this in like two days ! this shipped super fast , and this is n't easy to find so i 'm glad it was of nice quality .
i could watch this movie over and over again . i love the music and the movie . would recommend this for anyone .
just was n't for me . i found it somewhat boring at times . the ending was rather sad . it was just okay .
this was so funny ! ! could have been based on my son . i love comedy and have a lot of fun with these .
even though the book was written by a french author , the movie of the same name was a wonderful to watch as a family .
season 5 of roseanne was by far my favorite season when it came to reality on a tv series . so many real things happened this season .
i was n't expecting the movie to be the same as the book , and it was n't , but i really liked it and thought the performances were splendid .
what a fun movie ! predictable , but giant robots fighting monsters , with a different twist . very enjoyable movie . would recommend to any sci fi fan .
not a great movie but good action and you get to see the stars of the 70s , 80s and 90s .
extremely fell in love with the characters and loved the movie . it was unique in its own way . i love the family dynamics and the story line fits right in .
it was well made and engaging . gorgeous to look at . wondered what happened to the characters after the story ended . want to see more of a few of the actors .
if you want this movie , buy the blu-ray version . it 's both cheaper and has a better quality movie .
this is number one in my dvd collection . i watch it every day and never get tired of any of the programs . i hope this series never ends .
i am only five episodes in , but it only took one episode for me to be sucked into the story . the star is phenomenal as all of the characters she plays .
this series is only 3 episodes long but the stories are interesting and very well done . we like it that the doctor and the detective finally get together . american series would n't dare do that .
awesome collection ! i am so happy i decided to purchase it . i truly loved north and south . outstanding and more !
on my way to getting the complete collection . ( 4 more to go ) i have been watching the show since i was little on pbs and have always been a fan !
dont remember much actually , but it was a nice change of pace from other comedies . easy to watch but also easy to forget
good movie , a lot of action , a lot of intrigue . plus a very involved plot , interesting . four more words required .
a charming , classic doris day movie . not to be missed ! full of fun , laughs , and rooting for the underdog . well done , amazon , putting this in the prime category !
we are happy with this purchase and look forward to season 3 being available !
chuck norris does a very good acting job in this movie . most of his movies are not very good . this is one of the half dozen well made movies .
foreign movies are entertaining . this one even more so . quirky . do n't know if it was a comedy or a suspense action thriller . but it was really pleasing . not at all boring .
this is one of the most interesting series on television . the characters are believable but not all of them are likable .
it 's friends - where have you been ... ? if you do n't know this show , then you probably need to get this set .
great show . great historical view . it it good to know that post wwii things were a challenge for most people and they still are .
very well done . predictable , but very enjoyable nevertheless . actors all did a very good job . would love to see some kind of sequel .
i remember watching this when i was very young and enjoyed it . this is worthy the time to purchase and get a few laughs , plus you would see were naked gun series started ... .
cute story , will be sure to share it with the grandkids next time we 're together , i 'm sure they will like it also .
i 've wanted to see this for a long time . great great movie . little slower than modern thriller , but well worth the watch !
got the movie , have n't seen it yet , but trust me will do it soon . of course it will be good .
i thought this video was going to go a different direction and once i realized the direction i was worried it would get a little hokey but it actually made a lot of sense .
this is a great feel good movie , jodie foster does a wonderful job of acting . she grows up alone with a family member who obviously made their own language . great ending .
over all a good movie . there is lots of violence that is not as appealing to me as i get older . probably just me . the story line is good and the characters are well developed .
get a job and you & quot ; actors & quot ; need to get a new job too .
this movie was great and all acting was great . the twist was great also . i loved this movie and it is a realistic movie .
the show is very good i recommend it to friends to see it they ll loved it like i do
young guns is an excellent western movie filled with great talented actors who came together and put on a fantastic movie .
this one is top for me . i have watch 'd it over and over .
it was nice to watch an old favorite of mine . i have n't seen it since i was a kid . it arrived in excellent condition and i have no complaints .
watched this long time ago . always get it out on halloween to watch it . each time i watch it its just like the first time , scary .
fun film but difficult to figure out exactly what the point was . lots of violence but no real moral resolution .
this was a great premise for a movie , but the story line fell short . not sure what would have made it better , but i was not very disappointed .
what a wonderful film . very amusing and unique performances from a cast of characters . the plot is very unusual . excellent dress and sets .
it was good . i saw the movie before the play and i liked the movie better . it 's still good enough .
ok , honestly i do not watch this show , however my wife does and loved the season finally so much she just had to own it . she seemed to like it
there are many nice movies that are included in this collection that i remember from years earlier and enjoyed viewing again . some of my favorite actors in these collections .
excellent show ! keeps your attention throughout with an interesting storyline . the lead actress is more than capable of playing all her required roles . i am looking forward to season 2 .
night court is a really funny sitcom and i am glad i found seasons one and two at such a great price .
buy this movie if you have blu ray and you are willing to watch the whole thing . it is terrific .
so glad i purchased the complete series . was a great value price too . the acting is good , scenery great and stories keep you interested .
it 's a fun movie , all elements around of this film give you a great comedy movie , old but good enjoy it
i thought this was a great movie , some really funny parts , some parts that were a little over done , but for the most part a great comedy .
got this gift for my little sister as a present because she loved it so much when we were little . i love that i can find these movies on amazon to help bring back memories
if you like comedies you should get this movie . it 's great ! mel brooks is a genius . a great piece to my movie collection .
this is an above action thriller . it could have cut about a half hour from the beginning , but once it gets going it 's a lot of fun . underrated for sure . i recommend .
very good film with a lot of drama and mystery and some good and bad endings ... full of suspence
the same characters , many years older , doing the same amusing things with each other . if you liked american pie , you 'll like this too .
amy smart is hot in this one and she shows some skin . the humor is excellent , the road trip itself is funny , and the out come for the car is great ! !
not to boring for a foreign gay video but not much to get into if you are looking for a good gay video
my granddaughter loves home alone . i was able to get this set of 4 for less than the price of one dvd . ca n't beat that .
i am hooked ! the scenery , people , and story lines make for great entertainment . if you like ireland you 'll love this series .
i did not watch this my girlfriend did . it was a good movie and clear . the video was quick and no break ups while watching it .
if you are a wolverine fan it was worth seeing but i do n't know if i 'd have purchased as the first movie was so much better .
great movie , great music ! it was a hilarious comedy that any adult or teens can enjoy , however i do think it is inappropriate for small children .
this is a great movie , even tho peter jackson did make some of the scenes a bit too long . still the movie is a keeper .
daniel craig does a great roll in this sci-fi , and harrison ford as well , fantastic special effects . i hope movie makers keep making these kind of movies .
fun , funny , enjoyable , cute and entertaining ! it 's a youngsters first haunted house movie ! it has a touch of scares in it for a little one but more entertaining than anything ! good pick
this is a fantastic movie . i love billy bob in this movie . he is a great actor . i have watched this several times now .
it was every bit as good as the book , very entertaining and not a boring minute during the entire movie .
it was a good example of that era 's science fiction . i grew up viewing these movies and loved them as a youth .
this movie was just as great as the first . you can actually watch this one first and then the watch the first second and still understand . great movie ! ! ! !
my wife and i both love this movie , it definately teaches you that people can change no matter what background they came from
i bought this for my son in law , who had never seen it . no one should go through life without seeing this , one of the best movies ever made !
not a bad movie . it left something to be desired though with the storyline . it seemed just a tad cheesy .
i loved this movie ! excellent acting especially by eastwood . i love a movie with a moving storyline and good morals to the story .
it came extra early came in excellent condition ! i have no complaints this sitcom rules plenty of suspense i would recommend this dvd to anybody !
i love science fiction but this was so poorly done that you were wishing it would be over . can not recommend .
my dear husband is a great fan of all things from historical days . he also enjoys documentaries , many , many of which i have also purchased from amazon.com .
i love all the resident evil movies but this one more and i have watched it over and over the first day i got it
was for my nephew and he loves it watches it almost daily you are asking for to much info . excellent movie
this was definitely worth the money and a hard item to find these days but i am very happy with the purchase
the movie did not disappoint like so many other sequels will do . it was very entertaining and enjoyed it as much as the others .
the only part about this movie that it cut out a certain part of the book .
this spin off of the expendables is loaded with lots of action and comedy . i look forward to the arrival of the expendables 3 and in the out takes video , the new script is already in discussion .
i agree with the one star reviews , by and large . see it on tv if you must - it 's a forgettable film . a silly thriller .
great series on dvd at a great price and arrived on time in great shape . would do business with this seller again .
was good story and a lot of action . explain alot about air wolf . i own all of them now and will watch over and over .
it was the most inspiring movie i have watched . the chosen characters were great for this movie and the fact that everyone song their own parts were brilliant including the storyline
not factual , but a great story even so . lots of suspense and action , my son and i enjoyed this movie immensely .
the characters are well developed and engaging , as is the story line . people who like shows like fringe will like this one as well .
love sandra bullock . these are great movies ... and they were both in one package , too .
fun movie , lots of goofy humor , and ridiculous stuff . lots of fun to watch and they are both great together . great movie
also a gift purchase . these episodes really do hold up . good sound and picture . you will love this collection . great for holiday fun .
it was all in all just a good movie to watch ... kept us entertained , did n't drag on the same theme the whole time
i thought this one was very depressing . did not leave me feeling good about any part of it . i know it is considered a classic but i would not want to watch it again .
great movie - wonderful story . love it in 3d - sharp and clear . this was fun for the whole family !
not good enough for anyone of these actors ! do n't care for this movie ! i would not have done this movie if i was anyone of this actors !
great set . lovable characters . witty , full of laughs for young and old alike . try this and you ( and your kids ? ) will enjoy it .
we saw this movie in the theatres and then bought it for our 7 yr old son for christmas and we all love watching this movie .
just started to watch the good wife and i believe season 3 was the best so far , i started with season 1 , but its not really necessary
pretty awesome indeed . this is a great video to zone out to and everyone i 've watched it with loves it . good times ; - )
this was always a great movie , but bluray brings it to life . get it and keep it forever . i highly recommend this item .
complete junk and waste of time . it is boring . it is uninteresting . starts out cool but after 5 minutes totally loses it .
the bbc has the greatest sci-fi movies and series of all ; this series was a take off of the dr who series . i believe it is off the air now .
predictable but fun . nothing special , glad i did not waste my money at a movie theater but was worth seeing it at home .
my grandsons like this movie a lot . they want to be scared but not too much . i enjoyed watching it with them .
long time fan of this movie and great time to watch this since the 50 year anniversary of this terrible day in american history happen .
an ensemble of talented actors bring to life a nicholas sparks story . does it get any better than this ? i do n't think so .
basically a zombie type of movie . a super way to show the gritty part of older new york city . the characters were great . the monster creatures superb .
it was ok at times , at times the comedy was pretty raw . it took me about half the movie to realize the scenes were set up and people did not realize they were being filmed .
this is the kind of story you remember and go back to over and over ... again and again ... many thanks , bill
great job by ensemble selling the future to us . the storyline was touching . if you can suspend your imagination for entertainment , give this a try , it will be enjoyable nonetheless !
i 'm really enjoying watching the series . i like the main character , and find the drama interesting and thought provoking . hard to stop watching them once i get started .
could n't wait for this to get here and i was n't disappointed . love it and i really ca n't wait to order some more of my favorite old shows .
big fan of the lone ranger ! i remember this series as a kid , i had to have this , for my collection ! great quality dvd , good price !
this was a great price for a great movie . if you have n't seen this one , it is a good movie to pick up for a plane ride .
the person i purchased this for loves it and they said it gets better after the first couple of stories . this person also enjoys cartoon dvds .
not his best but classic time era of a simple american story of what was a real way of life and still is today !
loved the acting , story and the reality of the times . the & # 34 ; rocky & # 34 ; of baseball . all actors were great . emotionally thrilling .
we love this movie . it does have a lot of slap stick comedy , but it is very funny and family friendly .

i am new to this one and i have really enjoyed this show . recommend if you like drama , mystery , & intrigue . well done .

i bought this for my grandson . he wanted the collection so i bought it.it is a great gift set to give to anyone .
an interesting and diverse mix of classic movies from an iconic director all in one package at a great price . good stuff .
worth a watch if you ca n't find another movie . it 's not good or bad . just dull . the movie was slow and drawn out with nothing really happening . boring !
ca n't get enough of iron man . this was a good start to what will be some super movies . i ca n't wit for more of them .
this is a very funny show which should not be watched with small children . the characters are witty and insightful while being comedic . i hope there are a few more seasons .

funny and okay for a boring afternoon . i might even watch it again in another 20 years . give it a try !
yep , they tried to throw everything and everyone in here , but the mix just does not work on any level . there are too many killing scenes while there is very little story to balance it .
my grandson is a thomas the train fanatic . of all his thomas movies he likes this one the most so far .
perfect movie for date night . funny and a little romantic . we would recommend this movie to anyone who wants a good laugh
this movie is wonderful . the spirit in johnny is sweet . this movie touched my heart and shows that some people care more about helping others than feeling sorry for themselves all the time

this was a very funny movie . i laugh at this movie from the time it started until the time it finished .
this film is far superior to the original version , and colin farrell is magnificent ; the action is fantastic , the choreography very well done , and the acting very enjoyable , and the cgi awe inspiring .
i enjoyed this show . i wish there was a third season to be able to tie up some loose ends from the end of the second ( and final ) season .
fun , cute film ! creative great family film , that will keep the adults well entertained !
i laughed a few times but for the most part it 's a stupid movie . i 'm only writing this review to save people their time and money by not watching this terrible flick .
first and favorite horror / ghost movie i saw as a child . loved it . scared me as a child . : )
an adult type movie , it is funny as could be and i enjoyed it , the unrated is not for small kids
very pleased with it . jamie curtis has always been one of my favorite actresses . she is awesome in horror films .
if you 're into action movies , this is not the movie for you . it 's all dialog and slow at times , but overall it was okay .
tommy lee jones and ashley judd were wonderful in this thriller which keeps your interest throughout . this is a thriller with twists that keep you guessing .
this is a wonderful mini series that has a great story line as well as a good cast . it will keep you interested as it has adventure , romance and a little bit of everything interesting .

great ending to a great series . wish it did n't have to end , but this was the only way it could end . thumbs up all the way
there have been several movies made of this classic story . i have n't seen any that i do n't like , but this one is my favorite .
this was a very good movie . i think that the movie drive was inspired by this one . i recommend it if you like car chases .
dated and not very funny . or maybe i am too old to appreciate this movie . of course bill murray is always good .
i really enjoyed this movie . great story line and great music . i immediately downloaded the soundtrack after watching . thoroughly enjoyable .
i am a huge & # 34 ; little house & # 34 ; fan . i was glad that the entire series was released at a reasonable price .
the only reason i bought this movie was to make it easier for me to read the written word and be able to accurately picture the characters and scenes in my minds eye .
i have watched this movie over and over . it 's one that i will pick out to see again and again . the actors play their parts with excitement and makes the movie intriguing at every turn !
i liked every series i 've purchased , and that includes this series . i intend to get series 5 & 6 as well
this movie was as funny as i remember . i love will smith & tommy lee jones . the dvd arrived quickly and was in great condition . thank you !
liam neeson gives another great performance in this movie . the story did not have one dull moment . it 's one of those movies you do n't want to hit the pause button for any reason ! ! !
this is my only 1 star review , so far . i would not recommend this movie . it will put you to sleep . you do not see any of the bible story but rather just hear it .
i purchased this with high hopes but what a waste . the movie was a terrible production that looked like stop action photography .
boring and cheesy . could n't finish it . characters that were boring , hair that looked awkward . it was horrible for so many reasons .
i hate it because i could n't figure out when i ordered it if it was for american or european viewing . i hate it because i have n't figured out a way to view it .
fair movie and it has the twist and turns that makes movies good thats about all .
good movie . just a lot of destruction . a lot . wish there would of been more personal interaction . but a great action flick .
it 's hard to re make a classic . it was good , but really do like the john wayne original one more .
i rented this because basically i had seen everything else . it was a pleasant surprise . nice story and decent acting .
quite possibly the worst film i 've seen in some time . i had to turn it off . i had very high hopes for this as the concept is fantastic . rather poor execution and storytelling .
bought everyone i would start with the first season , then after you have seen them all you can pull out your favs . great cast , shame it was n't on longer .
i watched this movie today and it was great i love james bond movies now i 'm working on the next james bond roger moore
nothing out of the ordinary if you know anything about world war 2 and hitler . acting could have been much better but it fell flat for me .
this movie left you on the edge of your seats . the actors were fantastic and the movie was full of drama . i would recommend this movie to anybody .
it was really quite a good show . it 's one of those shows where the setting is almost a character in addition to all of the human characters .
and loved the story line . of course , most people have probably seen this by now , but we really enjoyed it . it was a good date night for us over dinner at home !
i 've been looking for this many years & it was better than the first time i saw it 30 years ago .
has comedy , a good story line , and a good tear jerker ( not that i cried but was about to : ) ) have to see its very good
it was a bit predictable but overall it was funny . i 'm not sure if i would recommend it over some other coming of age films .

robert downey jr. real play the part of holmes he did an outstanding job on the roles plus he is in my top ten i would pay to see ... .

it put me to sleep ... not the worst movie i 've ever seen . just does n't hold up to the original judge dredd .
i love this movie , it has great actors in it , and it shows how happy you can be at anytime when you have songs in your heart . great love story too

fun to look at . great fighting , good news at the end of the story
this is a good movie , the book is excellent and no movie can measure up , but overall they did a pretty good job with it .
storyline lacking and very predictable . good because it is based on a true story . a little cheesy in content etc .
i love this show , this was another great season and look forward to seeing the next shows of this great series .
the movie was in color and the acting was well done the script could have been a little better but overall a good movie to watch
i 've loved this movie since i was a kid ... one of my faves . great casting , great acting , original story line . love it ! ! ! !
i tried to buy this movie or rent it for years . i finally found a a new copy for sale and bought it . i was not disappointed . wow what a movie .
it 's rare that a sequel matches the original , and this one does n't . however , it was still a good tale , funny , and worth watching .
well my husband thinks this was a chick flick ( it was n't ) but we both enjoyed it . good action , story line and effects
although there is one rather foul word in the movie , for the most part , the movie is excellent . great music , and a story that makes you think .
i was very happy to get this item and i have enjoyed it immensely . i love barbra and this was a really good buy for something i had not been able to get sooner .
i loved this show . about as good as the first one , or maybe better . i really liked it . not a dull moment .
one of the best coming of age movies out there and it stands the test of time highly recommend this movie to anyone who is not sure about the movie ! !
i bought these for my husband and he 's been watching them a lot . he loves them and they are good quality .
not what we expected ! it was slow , boring and confusing . almost gave up on it and probably should have .
one of mel brooks ' best efforts , beautifully remastered on blu-ray . looks and sounds great , with a few really good extras included .
product was received in timely manner , and proved to be very enjoyable viewing .
i had an absolute perfect experience all around . great product , brings back a lot of memories ! ! thank you very much !
it 's a fun romantic comedy with an unusual story line . some good laughs . makes you believe there is the sweet boy next door kind out there for a girl to fall in love with .
kind of corny , but what a happy film ! have watched it at least 3 times and although the story is somewhat lame , the performances are incredibly talented !
this is worth purchasing even if you have seen some or all of the movies previously . the price is right , and it 's fun to rewatch old friends from the past .
not quite as good and funny as the live show , but still one of the best superhero cartoons i 've seen , if you like them quirky .
this is one of my favorite of steven seagal films , the sound is improved and the picture quality is improved .
this movie was quite hilarious . it is a good movie to watch when you want a good comedy . i would definitely recommend it
iron man 3 ( blu-ray / dvd combo pack ) is a great / funny to have in your collection . great ending .
all around happy and full of action . there 's not much to say but i will definitely recommend this product for a family movie .
a big disappointment on this blue ray , but a great , great film . universal did a much better job on their classics monsters collection .
this is a great series and just adding to our collection . i like to watch right before the new season goes live .
this was a gift to my sister who had no luck in search for it . she was surprised and loves this dvd
this movie is a classic . comedic timing is great . the acting is good and the characters seem so real . we can relate !
ok season picks up at the end . pretty typical star trek story plots this season . recommend for all trek fans
i 'm a big fan of the original three lord of the rings movies , and really enjoyed this first installment of the hobbit . ca n't wait for the next one to come out !
have not had a chance to view this dvd yet , but am sure it is all it is made out to be .
such an awesome movie ! so funny and will keep you laughing till the end ! i would watch it again and again ! classic !
i was expecting an hilarious movie . it was cute and amusing but not what i would call funny . predictable movie .
great movie . good for the whole family . very funny and imaginative . julia roberts was fantastic in this movie . would recommend to anyone .
the last time i saw this movie it was on disney channel years ago ! i never thought i would find it again , but this site really helped !
you either love him or take him for what 's he 's like as an actor . decent movie , not great , not bad , worth the two bucks
i have been a fan since the first season , the writers are great and the cast are so wonderful i love them .
clint is great in this , but not in the usual way . he becomes endearing and the ending is a great twist on things .
for me it was just ok , it did n't seem like a bourne movie without matt damon . the plot was ok in keeping with the other movies but it just did n't flow for me .
i just now started getting into this show . great show ! great price . i know it will be a keeper for years to come .
some people do n't like it but it 's one of my favorite movies . dialogue humor not slapstick comedy type . great buy
i had seen this in theaters and wanted to see it again before seeing the second one . i was delighted to see that it was still funny and i noticed little things i missed the first time .
i received this item in a timely manner and was pleased with the dvd 's and would order from this company again .
i love this series ! so different and lots of fun twists ! this is one of the few tv series that my husband and i both agree on !
we have all of the seasons of murder , she wrote and just love angela lansbury in this series . she is a superb actress .
it 's okay , and definitely predictable , but had some good moments . for sure you can compare it to & # 34 ; the matrix & # 34 ; movies .
did you notice that most people that gave this movie ( and titanic ) 5 stars , are women ? makes ya think , do n't it ?
a great old show to share with the kids . it 's always nice to find a show that both the adults and the children in the household can enjoy together ... good clean funny show !
iron man 2 was very entertaining and kept you interested . it was action packed with good acting on all parts . i enjoyed it it as much as my grand kids did .
this movie caught me off guard a little . it was a humor but was much more dark than expected . i really liked it , spacey is the man .
i remember growing up watching this and wanted to get it for my nephew ! i love it ! the packaging was great got it new !
this movie was ordered for my brother and he said it was a very good movie . we got it very quickly .
this movie is hilarious , great to be added to the dvd library as a classic . every time i watch it i find something new and funny
vince vaughn and owen wilson make a great comedy duo . you wo n't be disappointed if you buy this . it 's definitely worth your time and money . do n't hesitate to buy this .
seen this a few times , and it 's fun to watch . especially looking at mickey ; at least what he used to look like .
i love one piece ! this season was amazing and now this ! it was an awesome arc from the start till finish .
this is a cool series for our young generation . i love star wars so i am biased , but this series compliment the new movies .
this was surprisingly a good movie ! i think it 's best viewed with the whole family because it sort of takes you for a ride . it 's suspenseful and even funny at times .
love the movie , love actor , clean movie for all ages , family enjoyed watching this movie and appreciated that core christian values presented in it .
this movie was horrible ! the acting was not good , and they needed more characters to make the plot work . sorry i paid to rent it !
it was a gift for my husband , he loves these ice age movies . grandkids got him started on them . it was in new condition and played perfect . arrived earlier than i expected .
a plus for any zombie genre lover . i recommend it for your collection . it was highly enjoyable . a good suggested buy me !
movies lovers top movie hit . all the movie lovers i know highly recommend this movie . no waste of money here .
i loved this movie so much , i seen it when i was younger as i was growing up and i cant get enough
this is an oldie but goodie and would recommend this to anyone who loves old movies its a bit corny now but still funny
this is a bunch of terrible movies , no fx , no producers no directors , 8 is the number and 8 terrible trash movies are here ... do not buy do not rent forget it ... bad bad movies
i found this very entertaining . tom hanks does not disappoint , nor do the other actors . excellent rainy day and popcorn movie .
good action movie for an older set , not over the top but good viewing . i like this type of movie .
like the suspense and how it all comes together in the end . watch it as often as i get a chance . my wife even likes it 's story line .
the kids love it . not sure i 'd want to see it again . but , it is cute . wish it had more content .
i never get tired of this movie . it is a great film . action packed , realistic , good story , great acting . this is a great film .

war , westerns and comedy is what the duke is great at and this pack has 2 of the 3. got ta love it .
grimm has a multiple personality , scary , human story line , great acting , and great special effects . it keeps me coming back each week .
dvd was great ! ! nothing was wrong ! this show is amazing . if you loved the other seasons , you will continue loving the seasons . so far great ! !
this movie shows what drugs , adult book stores and dvd places can do to our young people . great movie . have watched it twice and at least 5 times before .
i fell in love with this series after watching a couple of episodes on tv and i had to get it on dvd ! !
this movie was pretty funny for what its intended purpose was . the main character is way over the top stupid but it fits the movie . there is crap load of blood though .
great escape movie when you you just want to see a lot of action .
i enjoy watching this movie over and over again . it has such a great family , christmas message . i will recomend this movie to everyone .
we all enjoyed it . it was not just funny for the kids . the adults enjoyed it also . it was fun !
a very entertaining film nicely remastered and uncut . an enjoyable commentary by the director and a very nice interview with the two leads .
i enjoyed this movie for a one time viewing . it was hard to watch , but entertaining . have not watched it again and probably will not .
this is a really good workout . however , i am very out of shape and need to work up to doing it . i 'm looking forward to that point when i can keep up ! !
absolutely terrible movie . at least it was relatively short . i watched the whole thing , thinking it had to get better . it did n't .
standard bond fare with few new plot twists . starts some new faces as standard characters but that is not enough to overcome a weak plot !
thought it was great ! loved everyone in the cast . will watch it again . [ probably a lot over time . ]
if you 're a star trek fan , you 'll like this movie . a few twists and turns and the dialog is actually interesting . great entertainment
i enjoyed this rendition of my favorite monster , godzilla . it was very enjoyable because so many other monsters were part of the destruction . i would definitely buy it again .
great story ! incredible cast of actors and characters . absolutely love this series . waiting for season four to come to amazon .
what a great & # 34 ; international intrigue & # 34 ; thriller ! as de niro is terrific ( as usual ) with a great supporting cast , this fast-paced thriller is highly recommended .
this is one of the few films i 'd call perfect . it gets everything right . buy it . right now . you will not regret it .
i really enjoyed watching this movie so much i watched it several times . i am always amazed at how far a person 's faith will take them . loved the mother in this film !
tony curtis surprisingly at his best . loved the period in which this film was filmed in . a cult classic to be sure
you can not go wrong with a good james bond movie . 007 is a classic and i think daniel craig does a good bond .
this is a good movie , i would recommend it to everyone to watch . i am having movie nights with neighbors .
this movie was fun to watch and was very entertaining . i loved the 3d features too . the story line is not perfect but overall is worth the money .
another great movie by a great cast of actors were very good . better than the book ! yet another to watch many times .
it is a very good action movie . i like stephen baldwin . i have watched this movie multiple times . i recommend this movie .
i really like this movie . keanu reeves and sandra bullock are very good in this film . it is exciting , suspenseful , and action-packed .
matt damon is matt damon . this flick is not close to the damon films , but not bad . worth watching if just to compare .
then look no further , here it is . acting was great , sometimes funny then a bit mysterious . see this now if you can ? that is if you can even see it !
nothing better to laugh with jennifer aniston . i think she did a great job in this comedy . supporting actors as well .
two unlikely people in this weird story line . i like quirky stories and enjoyed this movie . hope you do also .
the movie had no sound at all . very disappointing to watch . would n't buy this one at all . too bad as it looked like a good fred astaire movie .
watched this movie before reading the love dare book . both go hand in hand in keeping a good marriage for life .
the description was accurate , it was a thriller , action packed , and it kept you guessing . terrific movie , all the way through . would watch again .
this movie was okay , a good start and the ending was very good , the middle was very believable and it leaves room for a part ii if there was one to come out .
great movie but the original was much better . if you like action then this movie is for you . the only thing lacking were the special effects and futuristic world depicted in the original
i bought this and gave it as a present and she loved it ! she said it was just as she remembered !
the last in this series ! is as good as the other 3 and am happy i have it .
although i saw this many years ago when i was younger it is still a great movie and a real classic one all can enjoy for a long time to come
do you want to see why agent k is so quiet ? do you want to see what agent j would do for his partner ? then buy this movie and find out for yourself .
i saw this movie in the theater twice ... i saw it many many more times now that i have it on dvd . the special effects are incredible , and it has an overall more than excellent plot .
as enjoyable as the first time i saw it in the movie theater ; it was a good buy . thank you .
i found the second season rather boring and repetitive . there are no new ideas . my wife and i stopped watching after the third disk .
an okay movie ... good story ... but slow paced . the action is there , the actors are all good , but i have seen better movies of this kind . all in all , an okay film .
harry potter movies are excellent . now i have all the movies . i highly recommend to anyone who loves harry potter .
this is a good well acted show with lots of action . i usually watch 3 or 4 episodes per day .
this movie still holds up after decades . great storytelling and so well-made . fabulous acting , including bits by holly hunter and others . worth watching again and again .
shame on all of these talented actors ! all of you should have turned down the script ! what a waste of time !
dvd came as expected . a+ ! shipped well daughter enjoyed it as she has been waiting until disney would re release it and so i was glad to find it . thank you .
i have loved this movie since it first came out . its fun and very enjoyable . not heavy , light and fun . an old stand by movie to watch .
no problems with my discs . ca n't wait for season 3 ! ! !
this movie rocks ! ! ! ! ! ! . it was made with good director , actors and story line . i love scooby doo !
have season 1 and loved it so much i had to get season 2. great dvds with excellent actors . each episode is uncut just like when each was first aired .
this movie was stupid funny . it was what i expected . it was sooooo silly , but fun . i enjoyed the movie .
this is not an award winning movie . the plot is week , the acting is not award winning , but it is a fun girls night movies .
i bought this so would have a complete set as much as possible to go along with the video games that i currently have
i did not read the book but i found the movie very interesting and lots of fun to watch . peace
we all loved the movie . almost like the book . ca n't wait tell the other two books are made into movies .
i bought it because i used to work with one of the actors . it 's cheap and terrible , but in a good way .
love this show ! ca n't wait for another season . love the way carrie can remember everything ! the way the other characters interact is so entertaining .
great movies . they will give you a laugh if you have n't seen them . if you have , they are great for a lazy movie day .
this is a very interesting series we 've just started watching with the family . ca n't wait to catch up on the series !
great back story to the alien saga . breath taking visuals and fantastic acting . looking forward to seeing where this story leads .
this film keeps you laughing from beginning to end . for a fun film not for the whole family there are some adult moments and comments . i 'd rate it as pg
this guy will eat you up . one of the best . unbelievable , must read you must judge for yourself , but i highly recommend it . one two three four five six seven eight . nine ! !
being as tracy herself just had a baby she was inspired to make this workout . her moves are very unique and this workout will leave you feeling like you are really making some changes in your body .
after the years since the series was first produced it still pulls you in . i got hooked on the people and their lives . great entertainment .
shall ? set you free and sometimes that it what we all need to here the hard down to earth hart felt truth
the naruto series is a very middle of the line story of a boy wanting to gain respect and feel needed , the kids & i enjoyed the series very much .
i love this series and this season is great . some new faces but it does n't take away from the comedy
lovely film ... makes you happy and sad . strange fairy tale in modern times . nice to see a film that children and adults can enjoy seeing together
i really did not like it neither did my wife it was not what we thought . did not like the plot .
this movie was ok. it is not as good as the original but it was pretty good . it is not as bad as every one said it was . hope this helps someone .
loved this movie , if you need a good laugh , watch this movie . wonderful cast . wish there was a part two .
this is a really great movie ! full action packed , and even though its an older movie , its still one of the best . i would recommend this to anyone who likes action movies .
good photography and scenery , but weak on plot and action . not one of sandra bullock 's best .
i really enjoy this new series of the star trek movies . the actors are perfect for the parts they play and the story and action are excellent !
love this series ! if you are an x files fan then this is a show for you . dark and creepy .
common plot but the singing was well worth it ! reminded me of cher 's tv specials and a lot like all that jazz . very , very entertaining .
george burns singing the beatles ... how can you not get a kick out of that ?
i am enthralled with this program . it 's so & # 34 ; everyday & # 34 ; and i thoroughly enjoy it . are more seasons planned ? please say yes !
again this is a great movies from the 80 's good entertainment and it is fun to watch . love tom selleck
this movie was too violent to let our whole family watch , we have children as young as 6 ; better for adults but not the best superman movie we have watched .
perhaps i did n't give it a fair chance by getting beyond the filming of this movie , but cinematography is an important element in movie making as it sets the mood .
set of john wayne dvds was in like new condition , arrived promptly , well packed , what can i say ? what 's to complain . i would highly recommend this vendor based on my experience .
i had heard of this movie for years , but had never seen it . i thought it was going to be boring , but it was n't . just interesting enough to keep you watching .
this was a gift to a friend who enjoys british comedies . i thought when purchased that it was some series from the bbc , but turned out to be four separate films of british humor .
these are two very good movies and i highly recommend them . they would be great for a family movie night !
boring and the story line was terrible . they could have done a better job with the story line than they did
love watching this episodes . loved the special features too . loved the action of the show and the suspense in the show
had to have this one we borrowed it from my son 's collection and just had to have for ourselves . excellent movie .
here 's another christmas dvd must have . i love this movie and watch it over and over ( even when it 's not christmas ) .
it was ok to pass the time with but i will not get any more of this series . got a little boring .
ca n't wait for this season ! and 6 & 7 ! ! mary only got better with time and i ca n't wait to see these seasons again ! ! ! !
this was great ! perfect price ... . and perfect movie ! ! ! ca n't get much better than that ! my family loved it , we watched it all the night we got it !
i love this movie i have been waiting for it to hit dvd for a while im glad to have it and we will do more business soon
this is my old time favorite . creepy , dark stuff . this still scares me after all these years . love this stuff .
i was excited to hear the series was coming out in dvd then i too was disappointed that the series was n't . what gives only 4 episodes what happen to the other 18 ? ?
unfortunately i have not watched it yet , but it was a must have since we enjoyed the first expendables . will have to update once we watch it .
i liked this movie . it was different than the first original but it showed a more in touch and not so dumb peter parker .
i love the lord of the rings movies , and very much enjoy the special editions . it looks amazing in blu-ray
i am glad i bought this . i have all of nicholas sparks works . this just added to my big collection .
one of the better star trek series . i watched some of the others , but could never get into them much .
typical sequel , not as good as the first , by far , but fans of the original will enjoy the action . harder to follow storyline than original , but great characters and touching moments .
i watched these movies , one and two - once and that was enough for me . sorry , not a fan of these movies , but my husband is and he was thrilled with it .
this is an excellent movie and one of the best suspense movies i have seen . i very much recommend this to anyone liking this sort of genre !
i love pooh so much , i was so excited to have them bring him back like i remember from my childhood !
i have owned this on dvd one of the best vampire animes ever made and i think the bluray is great on my 60 & # 34 ; .
i thought it was a great price for all 4 movies . and my boys loved getting it for christmas . as always , service was excellent with amazon .
a pair of my favorite actors , doing there best type of role , they really made a good movie with this one .
this movie is adorable ! the acting is good , the quality of the dvd is good . i love a good musical . this hit the spot .
always have time for frank no matter what the subject . ca n't wait for 'the naked runner ' to be released on dvd . must be one of the best spy thrillers ever made .
i enjoyed this movie , but there is an entirely unexpected turn of events in the story . it 's a shame because they had the elements of a good mystery , but took the easy way out .
it was wonderful to view this film again . it brought back memories as a child watching this on tv with my mother and sister . i 'm glad i made the purchase .
this is one of my favorite dvds that i have ever watched . this video had some of the best matches though the years .
love the dvd great movie brought for my daughter who is starting to like classic movies especially musical she enjoy them
had its funny moments , but overall , it was kinda gross - and not that funny as a result - i 'm not offended , just was not as entertained as i thought it would be
this is a great movie , two people trying to allow themselves to fall in love with each other . i think the world needs more love stories like this with two great actors . great chemistry .
for those who enjoyed reading the beloved novel , the cinematic version does it justice . very enjoyable , suspenseful , and fast-paced flick .
somewhere in time will take the viewer back to a time of innocence which we may never know .
grimm is one of the coolest tv shows , its supernatural with the twist , i love this show . if your a fan of supernatural this show is for you .
kyra and the rest of the cast gave very good performances . it was interesting to watch the characters evolve . the closer quickly became my favorite television show .
being a horror fan i really loved this twin pack , both movies where different and worthy of being in my collection .
very good remake of the remake , the second one made from the classic original 50s sci fi , lots of scary moments and wild effects , one awsome monster movies with a super cool ending ...
the first couple of movies were ok but the last four were really awful they were not even scary just bad !
this was a great movie ! i love all the riddick movies , and i really liked this one ! and i loved that it kept with the story line too
really funny movie i had heard it was not any good . but they were wrong do not recommend for kids .
my wife is a big christmas movie nut . it was nice to be able to purchase a single episode from a television show she enjoyed with our children when they were little .
watching these old shows always brings a smile to my face . i am glad i got a couple of seasons .
i want to take a trip like this ... italy is high on the list of countries in which to do it ! ! !
i first watched this on a cold december day when i had nothing else to do . i went on netflix and found this . sooo fun ! it is my favorite holiday movie ever !
i have not seen this is a gift for m y parents as they are house bound & they love all animal movies so am sure they will love this one !
previews were better than this movie . i was kind of lost with the back story and this was way to far of a reach for her to play this part .
very interesting premise . jason played it just right , again . i had to add this to my jason statham collection . worth buying .
i 've heard no complaints or negative comments from the recipient so i have to assume that this should be rated high .
i do n't care how old you are this movie is for skill ages ... children , adult , of people . this movie makes you feel great . enjoy viewing it ! !
this movie is very cute one , our kids like them . dvd is good condition too . thank you and have a good day friends ! !
this was a great series . wish there had been more . television was much better back then .
i never seen this before i bought it and i watched it and it was a very great dvd and im very happy that i bought it.i recommend it
after watching a couple of the series i finally remembered this when it was on tv . a good series and somewhat realistic .
good product . i like it . good dvd . good actors . good . good . good . good . good . good . good . good ! !
however this is one of those super hero movies that little boys love and will watch over and over . purchased as a gift for my 11 year old son .
this dvd was cute and interesting . i thought it was just as good as the 1st one was and would recommend it to anyone who has seen the first one .
good movie , seen it several years ago and wanted to own it so i bought it and was glad i did .
its great . my husband will rewatch it over and over . for fathers day bought him the whole thing ... all seasons !
i really love this show ... its one of my favorites and it is one of the first animes ive ever watched . the storyline is so unique .
this is a super and beautifully filmed saga of all things indian . do watch it even if you have no particular interest in india you will have after viewing this video .
i never got to see this at the theater so i bought it and was not disappointed ! a very entertaining , funny , heart-warming movie !
this was bought for my brother . not sure if he 's gotten to it yet , but i 've heard that it 's a good series .
no problems buying used products , everything about this purchase was just great . i highly recommend buying like this to all my friends .
i laugh through this whole movie ! what a great combination of actors to act in a movie that is enjoyable .
i have watched this movie time and time again . will continue to watch it . it is just that good . buy it .
this it fun for star trek fans and those that are not . in our family we have both and we enjoyed watching it together .
so my wife did n't like it as much as i did , it was a great movie and i will watch it over and over again . i 'm looking forward to getting the second one .
this was a great dvd as it was based on a true story . i enjoyed it as well as other family members enjoyed it .
i love sandra and george but i was n't a fan of this movie . i 'm happy i rented it first before buying it ! !
i guess i am a kid at heart but i always enjoy watching these shows even though i have seen them before .
this was for my son and he likes it very much . he watches them over and over , basic family fun .
great movie at a great price . if you like classic westerns this movie is for you . has some of the great western movie stars of all time
a love movie that i like very much , it is also a sad movie but the message in it is amazing
they do n't make them like this anymore . funny and with some of top actors for the project . had to add to my personal collection . would suggest you do like wise .
this is one of those movies that you have to watch to the end and discover for yourself what you believe and do n't believe , just watch !
i did not like anything about this show and i will not watch it again . i found it offensive and trite .
i have watched and enjoyed this product . it is exactly what i was looking for . will look for more related dvd 's .
this two actors seem to be made for each other . lots of good acting and humor . so buy is soon .
i loved this movie when it first came out , and i still watch it time to time . no animated movie will be better than this , in my opinion .
very good version of the story , goes great with the new film by jobs . i recommend buying the two films
it 's a stephen king adaptation . how can you go wrong ? these are a little on the silly side , but that 's the best part .
i am still amazed every time i watch this movie . the effects are fantastic and the acting amazing . top that off with a fun plot and this movie is still a must buy .
this is a great older horror movie . very suspensful ! i would reccomend this to anyone who likes psycho , birds , or any other older scary movie .
thought it would be a good series but i was wrong , i really did not like it i gave it away
this was a great adaptation of the book with great acting and all in its original setting . the ending is perfect .
i love this type movie , it is fun , romantic and a great way to see some of italy . it is like traveling and never leaving your home .
fun , crazy movie . all the adults in our family thought it super funny , very entertaining . this is definitely not for children , i 'd say no one under 18 .
i am a huge scooby-doo fan , so loved this box set . i was a little confused why the third season was different that the first two in title sequence . there are great special features .
my collection of musicals will never be complete until this very entertaining favorite is released in dvd widescreen . ( hint , hint ! )
this is such a nice movie that i wish everyone would watch it at least once . i 'm sure we would judge people less just knowing we all have a past .
i bought this dvd because i have enjoyed his previous dvds , however , i was disappointed . this is by no means as funny as his other dvds . this fell flat with everyone in my home .
an easy way to work out and get in shape areas for people who are over 50 years old and want to work out
i was very happy with how quickly i received this item and it was new so there was nothing to worry about , like it being scratched and such . thank you very much .
the product was everything that the seller said it would be . it arrived pretty quickly too . i am very satisfied ...
great cast , fun spoof . it kept our interest all during the movie . some was silly , but it was fun anyway .
an older western with harrison ford that is also a comedy ! plenty of laughs and fun while viewing this movie !
too long and out dated . the ending was the best and probably the most famous part . worth waiting for it .
watched for a few minutes and just felt depressed and bored . no excitement here ... just blah . would not recommend this to anyone .
since i started watching fringe , i loved it and decided that i had to own all the episodes . this was # 4 of 4 .
i found this movie to be better then the first one . i hope there will be more .
i bought this movie ( did n't read the preview ) was expecting to get some lord nelson action but not in this one .
this is a movie that grows on you each time you watch it . the little ones enjoy it because there is just enough silliness to make it funny .
i have been a bones fan since the series first aired . every season gets better and better . looking forward to many more !
the first time i saw mad max was back in the mid 90s . but today , on blu-ray , incredible . what a trilogy to watch
if you want to update your martial art collection buy this dvd . its action packed with high flying acts and kicks .
what a fabulous movie . it makes me feel like a little mouse . it was all that back in the day .
happy to get the series . would recommend you to others . proud to give this set as a gift . great shape
this is an excellent movie ! dancing is great ! story is great ! actors are great ! loved it ! one of my favorite movies .
its okay . i like cartoons , all of them . this one took the stargate story further , a bit over the top as far as cartoons go . but that is what you get with morality plays
he still can sing and the group had many hits . if you were a fan back in the 60 's you wo n't be disappointed .
not what i expected . suppose to have comedy in it , but i thought it was dull and boring . pretty disappointed in the movie .
this has been and always will be a favorite hitchcock film . i still think it is a very good movie .
then i watched it again and it was just okay . i lost interest mid way but i love jeremy renner and that kept me through for the rest of the movie .
love how all the detectives get along and have each others back . it has a good crime stories , also combines some humor .
great movie . a bit dated now but if you can get past that very funny and original at the time .
i just love this hbo series ... i would recommend to anyone who has n't watched it ... it 's a must to see this series ...
we enjoyed watching it for our dinner and a movie . it was full of entertainment . we stayed awake ! you 'll like it too .
the story itself has been done many times and really needed more work . however they did make some interesting twists . the acting was quite good .
i wish they made more movies like these nowadays ... it is simple enough to watch , but unique enough to be memorable !
i was pleasantly surprise i enjoyed the movie so much . good cast of actors to carry on the star trek story .
this has a great case . a really good movie so i decided to buy it & add it to my library .
i love this movie it really gets you right there . i have been trying to buy the dvd hd for sometime . acting is exceptional and story is excellent .
this is a great version of the movie . if you 're a fan of the movie then you should definitely get this one .
very good dvd , good matches , great moments could have been longer would have made it a little better but a great purchase none the less
i have watched this movie many times is he or is he not real and what is the point of the movie watch closely and you might discover there is more to life
the movie stayed very close to the book and made the characters come alive for me . i would recommend this dvd .
i enjoy this movie ... but it 's my sister 's favorite christmas movie ... so i bought it for her ... for christmas , so i have to wait to see it .
the kids loved it as much as we did when we were children ! wonderful story and a great message . classic disney .
beautiful ! the cast of characters were excellent . full of faith and inspiration . a must see for families . i highly recomended
this is a great family movie . the movie streamed well , and the video quality was great . i would watch it again !
i went to the movies and saw this film and enjoyed it . it was a fun movie to watch and i would recommend it to anyone .
this is in excellent condition and arrived in a timely manner ! thank you so much . : )
it 's hard to remember just how ground breaking this show was . it 's aged very well , still one of the best !
i remember this from saturday morning television growing up . it all very campy now , but back then it was great stuff ... morality plays set in the future
great movie . its my personal favorite and was my sons until the new version with andrew garfield . i 'd definitely recommend it .
was n't great . not really a fan . could n't tell if it was a spoof or if it was for real .
the special effects and the concept of dreams within dreams make this a visual delight . it 's a movie you could watch again and again .
i was glad to find this dvd -- it is quite the same as the books , and very enjoyable . i will watch it many times with pleasure .
... the writers of lost throw in more turns and twists that keep you hooked ! love this show and will be sorry when i 've watched all episodes from all seasons .
pretty good movie . as good as the book in my opinion . at least it wasnt as scary as i was afraid it might be .
it took me some time to figure the plot out on this movie . it has it 's moments . some of my kids liked it some did not .
ever seen blair witch ? or , how about the office ? like that , but more gross
i wish they 'd get red john and continue on with other storylines . simon baker is very interesting to watch . he 's like one of the guys with a gift .
this is a movie trying to be scarey and it just quite does n't make it , but watchable for an old movie .
i 've been a fan since they first aired and i 'm thrilled to have found them here for a very good price .
this is one of the best movies from the early 80 's regarding disney studios . funny and dramatic . it 's a little corny but worth purchasing . everyone 's performance is great .
this isnt one of her best , but its still filled with great lines . get im no angel first , then watch this one .
i have yet to view this movie , but based on the quality of the stars , i am sure i will enjoy it .
i enjoyed this movie a lot . its funny and its just a great fun movie to watch . this movie definately have me wanting to watch more of jack black movies .

i grew up with andy griffith show ! ! i enjoyed each show for the morals they share ! ! a must see , for each season ! !
saw the movie in the theater , loved it and the music is awesome ... ... knew i wanted to own it for myself .
the acting was less than stellar to say the least . very stiff all the way around . the plot was average . i would n't waste your money on this one .
didnt think i was going to like this but as soon as her mom turned into a bear i couldnt stop laughing
my husband likes old war movies , so i purchased this for him . neither one of us had ever heard of it . he really liked this movie .
i just love this series . for some reason i did n't discover the show until this year so i went back to season 1 .
all this movie is a feel good movie for all ! ! ! i liked big brother looking after little brother in the movie !
what can i say : this is one of the best films , ever . it 's a must in everyone 's dvd collection ! rock on , wayne !
gary cooper ; one of my favorite all time actors who i watch every chance i get . such a good historical movie ; get it .
i gave it five stars because it was an interesting movie of survival . overall a good movie to watch on a rainy night .
what a terrible movie . academy award ? what ? ! this was so boring i could n't finish it and i sold it right away .
i first watched the `` toy story '' about four months ago . i enjoyed it so much i went out and bought all them of the `` toy story movies '' .
like most ghost movies but some scenes are a bit different . this made the movie stand out more from the rest of the movies .
great , great comedy loved every minute of the season . we are looking forward to seeing the rest of the shows .
this is a british film an intriguing plot i saw it many years ago and finally found and bought it . it is is as good if not better then before .
not only acting and directing this movie was great , but the story was very captivating as well . it haunted me for a week .
this one michael myers returns , we purchased because we love the movies and wanted to have the whole collection recommend highly
if love the series you will love this . got what i paid for in great time from a great place .
good movie more of these kinds of movies should be made , true life stories i enjoy . so informative of the situations of many children around the world
it does n't live up to the stunts that were performed in 1 & 2 . yet all that battle came to a satisfying end in an unlikely manner which made the movie ... '' still good ''
great show , every interesting episodes , great for the entire family . exciting episodes , wo n't be disappointed . order now . excellent cast ; ;

a good finished to the series laugh my head off wish it did n't have to end but enjoy all of them
my 9 and 4 year olds both love scooby doo . it is hard to find something they both like ! some scenes are a bit scary for the 4 year old
clint eastwood is always fun to watch and always has some great lines , but this was just a weak and pathetic movie .
best one put out by disney since beauty and the beast . i find it superior animation and great for family viewing .
this is one of the most awesome movies i 've seen in a long , long time !
wesley snipes is like a super hero in this film , different kind of hero with a whole of action , and martial arts fighting ! !
awesome older movie that never gets old no matter how many times you watch it . hard to find in stores but you can order and receive in just a few days from amazon .
i could not wait to watch the next show . this series is good clean entertainment . i really wished it had not ended .
dvd in excellent condition , as advertised . movie is kind of weak , but it is michael moore 's first effort ! worth owning .
i enjoyed this movie and would recommend it . if you liked the trailer , you will like the movie . better than i expected .

purchased viewing rights to this movie as it 's a favorite with my grandsons from ages 8 to ? ? ? ? humor throughout .
tom hanks can do anything , and he made a great movie here . actors do a good job of singing the soundtrack .

i have seasons 1 thru 4. i have to buy 5. the picture is beautiful on my sony blu-ray player . its a great investment .
this is a great old movie far ahead of its time . would recommend it to any sci-fi fan .
i 'd never seen this movie from start to finish . now that i 've seen it in context it 's funny , classic robert downey , jr. where in the world is val kilmer these days ?

this has to be the best movie i 've seen in a long time ! why ca n't they come out with more movies this good ?
i 've seen this a couple times and laugh alot . john m is just great . ca n't wait to see red 2
this is one of my favorites . it 's packed with action but does n't take itself too seriously ! seriously great movie if you 're into action and ridiculous humor : d
i just wan na say that all films in this set looks great on blu-ray , but i really wish all of these were the director 's cuts .
this was the funniest movie i have watched in quite some time ... . this was such an amazing movie this is a movie you can watch over and over again .
this is a pretty good story movie , most of the stories in it are pretty scary and not boring , i always enjoy watching it .
great movie on of the best of all times , great acting and a great story all combine for a great movie .
like all of elizabeth taylor 's movies , this is a great movie . it 's hard to think someone so beautiful can act so ugly . i loved it !

i have been a fan of this show since forever . my daughter and i love watching these reruns ! ca n't wait to order the rest of the available seasons !
such a sweet story . i have never cried so much over a movie in my life . i am not sure how children would get through this one .
i have season one to season four of fresh prince . now i just bought season 5 and continued watching will smith comedy of fresh prince .
i never had the chance to see this movie when it came out , but now i 'm sure glad i did get it . it was worth the buy .
i like good old movies . had always heard about it but this if the first time i have ever seen it .
for these two actors , i thought this was very boring , but then maybe i just was n't in the mood that day . will give it another chance at a later date .
nice move will watch it more this year as never tire of watching christmas movies all year round just love christmas
i think my husband and i watched about 10 minutes of this before turning it off . terrible movie would not recommend for anyone .
one of my favorite tom cruise movies . my son is 15 and at some point i want him to see this movie .
i love this show . i wish it lasted longer . its funny , sad , awkward , emotional , happy and suspensful all at once !
i could n't get some of the audio settings to work on the bluray on my player which was disappointing . the music was ok , but i 'm afraid to say it 's nothing special .
very funny video . good character interplay . hillarious songs . moral values shines through all the silliness . good for any time of the year . highly recommended for children of any age .
well so much for everything i loved as a kid being as good today . this `` documentary '' is very funny now and the stories it tells are beyond belief . worth a look for the laughs .
great movie if you 're a horse person - fair acting and it does tell the story of a great horse .
a cheap production with worse sets and worse still the dialogue . i watched at the most 10 minutes before i gave up . ugh ! !
personally , i thought it was very dry . it is a cartoon and funny in parts , but it is not a johnny depp film . i did not even finish it all the way through .
this movie was not exactly what i had expected . while it was ok i would not pay to see it again .
my dad loves this movie . i have n't watched it yet , but my dad keeps giving me good reviews from it .
it does n't get any better . the best spiderman movie yet . great script . great cast . excellent direction . good music . good job by all involved .
i have not watched this movie yet , but i have watched the movie before , thus my reason for purchase . with luck i will not have issue when i fire it up on the blu-ray player .
this was a very entertaining movie for both my grandchildren , my children and myself . it works for numerous generations . it can easily be enjoyed when watching it more than once .
this is one of my favorite movies and to have both in one box is so great ! i am so glad it was available that way .
if you like the oldies then this is a good collection for you ! she does some great performances in these 4 movies and you will enjoy them .
this one held our interest from start to finish . very nice story line , with lots of human interest and action .
it was ok as a movie goes but not what i would want to watch again . the ending kind of left you wondering about how they ended it .
i love this series it is one of my favorite shows of all time ! i am glad to see that this is now on dvd ! great picture quality !
i have loved this movie since i was a kid so will you and your kids .

this is one of the best movies i have ever seen . everyone should see this movie . this movie will change the minds of many people
very pleased with the quality of this dvd . used products are generally not in very good condition . will continue to buy from this seller in the future .
loved the characters , loved the stories , hated to see this end . i would encourage everyone to watch this series soon .
this was funny . i found it very entertaining and the perfect , no thinking , escape from reality . i recommend it for laughs .
i was n't even born yet when this was filmed ... but my heart is in the older movies . they are so wonderful .
do n't waste your time & $ . this movie was a boring drama . there 's no exciting scenes or good dancing . the plot is way stupid .
me and my grandson liked this move very well . we went to the movies to see it and then watched it on amazon prime .
this is just too weird for words ... . i did n't care for it . more wasted money . i hate movie theaters , but wish i had rented this one from the library .
most of the episodes were fine - but a few were lacking in real content . the characters were well cast .
this movie was great . the action , the suspense , that acting all came together in a great way to make a great movie .
this movie was alright . it just was n't very funny or interesting . i might have laughed once throughout the movie .
a good family entertainment adventure . not quite as good as the original movie , but still an enjoyable evenings entertainment . worth the purchase price .
this blu-ray version of the movie is exactly like the dvd version . just at a lower price . buy for fans . rent for others .
wonderful , funny and touching all at the same time . great job by kevin kline and sally field .
it will stay in my collection as a prequel to the lord f the rings series but wo n't revisit it often .
the story line was not what we expected and was highly entertaining . we found ourselves laughing out loud more than once .
modern classic with a blu-ray loaded down with tons of bonus content . not to mention incredible sound and picture . and at this price ? amazing bargain .
all the actors in this movie are wonderful , but i love mama and the little girls take the show ! ! ! love this one ! ! !
my husband and i watch this show everyday . this dvd series stays in our dvd player . you will fall in love with the characters .
hilarious ! this movie is th usual from will farrell ... it is a family favorite to watch on movie night ... great flick ! !
so much love between a man and his dogs . the story is well described . the dogs should have won an award for their performance . great movie .
the dvds came very quickly . i absolutely love this show and always will . it has all of the episodes for the second half of season two .
was n't sure how good this would be but i thought this movie was pretty good . i liked how it ended too .
i absolutely loved the story . the only thing i think it needs is to have spanish subtitles . great set anyway .
good movie.. the acting was decent and the story was good .. i recommend seeing this
was a wonderful series in the 80 's . i enjoyed the series today as much as i enjoyed it then . everything arrived on time and was packaged well . the dvd 's ran well .
this is such a wonderful movie . it can be enjoyed by the whole family and teaches a valuable lesson about respect for nature . i highly recommend it ! ! !
both movies were as i remembered them but almost as if they were made yesterday . the buying experience was great .
im trying to buy ever single season they have it takes awhile and i will keep buying them they are funny
i bought this movie because i wanted to see what friend talk about it and i loved it and i loved it
great show , great writing and great stories . love the characters and really enjoying all episodes . so wonderful and refreshing . thanks .
i had no idea what to expect from this movie and i have to say that i was pleasantly surprised . i had tried reading some of the books but i found them quite dry .
sandra bullock is so great in this movie and we love football . we bought this as one of our first blu-rays because it is going to be a classic .
the movie had a lot of twists and turns , however , the overall storyline was pretty predictable . i did not expect the cursing and explicit language and think it would have been a better movie without it .
i am a true romantic and enjoy comedies as well . this is a great movie with two great actors in it . julia roberts and richard gere do an excellent job in this movie
we love this series . great acting and great script . ca n't wait for the next season to start . only reason i have showtime .
this movie was funny and lighthearted . it gave a great message on what family means and what is important . this is a must see film .
i liked this movie , had some very touching scenes acting was good , as in most movies it had its moments . yet another end of the world dvd i can add to my collection

this is an enjoyable classic . while not for everyone , if you enjoy the comedy of eddie murphy , this is worth your time .
i love the female lead from her days on seinfeld . one would n't think she could top that role but she has ! you will laugh , laugh , and laugh some more .
helps complete my james bond series , some i enjoy more than others . this bond i do n't particular like but i love the series .

this movie is enjoyable to watch . it is n't very scary , but you can still sit down and enjoy watching it every now and then .
it did n't make me laugh ; it made me sick to my stomach . i ca n't understand how this movie rates all those stars .
its always fun to see another godzilla movie , and this one delivered like the others so it was fun to add to our collection .
i love period dramas and this one is a keeper for sure . it is well acted in every way and i have added it to my dvd collection .
this country has seen a lot of bad things happen to it over the last 4 years . now you know why . obama .
i had heard this was not a very good movie , but i thought it was well done . gerard butler was not the best phantom they could have chosen , but the rest of the cast were fine .
great alien movie with lots of action while trying to get rid of the bad alien as there are two of them and the good guys picked the good alien to help .
i chose this rating because this movie is awesome . i like the quality of the movie . i would recommend this to anyone who likes this movie .

excellent movie and great acting . it keep you interested all throughout the movie . harrison ford and michelle are really good in this movie
believe it or not this version is tons better than the one with humphrey bogart , audrey hepburn , and william holden . bogart and holden were too old for their parts .
it has all the elements you should expect from this kind of movie . one of the early fight scenes in the snow clearly inspired kill bill vol . 1. very creative .
it is all about guns and shooting - at people . i thought it was going to be about a basketball player .
awesome , inspiring , funny movie . goldie hawn is great here ! ! ! it 's an old one but one of her best films ! i love it .
first introduction to the iron horse , it is a must have for any sports fan

not like the original at all to me was a lot of nothing but music was good and 3d ok
lots of good songs and special effects . steve martin is worth the price of admission or , in this case , purchase .
modern theme action show . watching season 2 now . like the actors and story line . reminds me of some clint eastwood type movies .
this is a great series ! fun and very like the book ! they should have continued it . . . great gift for someone you like .

i love the actors in this and i love the story line . if you want a heartfelt movie , try watching this one .
i have n't watched this movie since the 70 's when i was a kid . the songs and the scenes brought back a lot of memories . it was wonderful viewing this .
awsome movie great actors . and of course this is the greatest story ever told . they do n't make good bible story 's like this anymore .
just a silly movie but then i like movies that make me smile and does n't take life so seriously . it 's fun .
i watched this show on usa and loved every minute of it . anthony michael hall is so good in it .
this movie is so like mark harmon . he is a good guy and all bad things seems to happen to good guys .

funny movie . some scenes are kind of raunchy but it still was a funny movie . though i would n't let young children watch it .
hugh fan of the series . i am so in to it that i watch the entire series in one day .
i think each movie has gotten better . not that that was hard . my teenage daughter loves them . we have to complete the series .
this show is as good now ( or even better ) than i remembered . the characters and the story lines are all wonderful . truly , this is a tv classic .
it was not what i was looking for , i would have to say i would not recommend this film to anyone .
it 's not the best but its an ok movie , some dumb parts but its good for a zombie movie collection .
bad content i did not want to watch this film . it is not a good film to watch at all . i thought it was going a comedy . its not !

i think this remake was very well done and well cast . it was a little disappointing that they changes the location ( no mars ) but otherwise i thought it was well worth the time .
this movie was to slow for me i got very bored even the music was boring i wo n't get another silent movie .
this movie has an edge and it 's cool . i could watch it twenty times and grow more obsessed with each viewing . watch it in a dark room .
this is a movie that is bound to become a classic . having not lived in germany during wwii , i imagine that the times were very much as portrayed .
this movie falls into my top 20 worst movies of all time . i ca n't believe i sat through the entire movie . please , please please consider almost any other movie before you watch this one .
i really enjoyed this series , it is so different from other shows . holds my interest through out the show and makes me look forward to the next one .
i just saw this for the first time . another typical chevy chase vacation movie . it is entertaining and will give you a few laughs .
this one of my daughters favorite movies . she loves to dance and sing along . this has a cute story line
wow ! this is a wonderful series full of drama and intrigue . you 're constantly left thinking and become almost as obsessed as the main character with finding out the truth . ca n't wait for more !
basically the anime version of the terminator with alot of violence , blood , and somewhat nudity . nice late 80s early 90 's cheese .
i loved this cartoon . it is both different from the ordinary cartoon and it is soooo funny . really enjoyed it !
have not gotten around to watching the whole thing yet but started it . i remember watching it when it first came out , wanted my son to get a chance to see it .
ok ... this is the last one for today . great . one word says it all . you should not be required to use and waste words to rate anything .
a wonderful movie and the best on jesus ! next to the gospel of john of course . the tape was in good condition and i loved the movie !
i love this series and will always give it five stars . it has everything , action , aliens and great story plots .
sharon still looks great , but the film is not worth the purchase . enjoy the classic original , but pass on this one !
it was a very good movie and the whole family enjoyed watching the movie , while we watched the movie we were all laughing
it was a great movies that deserve ten rates and there nothing dislike about it i like it very alot .
everytime i watch one of these episodes , i learn something new . i only wish there was something as good on tv now .
high action movie . i liked the movie but it is very bloody with a lot of close up scenes . my wife did not like these scenes .
i loved both these movies and enjoyed that they were both offered together for a great price . great movie pack .
we thought it was hilarious although our son thought it was a little scary . loved both main characters in the movie . tragic loss ... .
i have all these books and even though the movies can live up to my imagination , i still liked them very much .
really didnt see much of it . i cut it off was bored to death . it may have been better at the end i do n't really know .
i love this series ! ! ! the characters , the costumes , the life style ... a time where so many people had just nothing compared to these folks ! ! !
this was a very well acted production . i thought the makeup to age the actors could have been better , but this was a good investment .
the movie is weird . and it 's a bit drawn out . but the story is unusual , and the characters are very well done . it was instantly one of my favorites .
excellent tv series from the early 70 's . columbo is still a joy to watch 4 decades later .
if there going to come out with more one piece collection like this than it better be english dubbed because only having english subtitles is just lame and not very enjoyable in my opinion .
i was n't sure if i was going to get this one but i 'm very glad that i did . thank you !
i got this movie as a christmas gift for my dad . i definitely recommend it to any adventure movie lover . it is both clever and exciting !
not sure of this one need to show it more times only seen it once will be watching more time soon as christmas is on it way
i thought this would be an interesting movie , and it was . i did n't expect shakespeare , and i was correct . al in all , it was an enjoyable movie .
dvd 's were clear and crisp . the program 's were interesting . i 'm really enjoying the series .
i bought this for my husband 's birthday gift and he loves it . now he wants the other seasons . it came on time and in good condition .
i would like to see another season cause it was n't long enough for me so excited about this show yay
dark , spooky , a little humor and great performances make this film a keeper . boris karloff wants to rise from the dead and has his butler try to help him . enough said . 8 )

its an incredible movie that never allowed me to see ahead of the movie even when i knew the ending because of the title

excellent movie , great plot , and story , must have for any dead space fan and action movies fan . will help you enjoy the dead space story if you 're into it
this one completed our collection so i 'm very happy ... that my daughter 's happy .. plus , it 's a good quality disc .
an age old story line with the usual circumstances , but the acting is very good , which makes it an interesting . i 'd recommend it for anyone , but especially for couples .

great movie ! i am glad to have it as part of my collection .

i think it will become more interesting with each season , it needs work . a little basic but hopefully will mature in future seasons .
despicable me is a great movie . my kids love it , and so do i. comedy , action , and drama . everything a good story should have .
good sequel , good second group of actors . plenty of military action with a little science fiction throw in for good measure
i find this show fascinating , and at times depressing . i just got around to watching season 5 , and there have been changes in the lives of the characters . looking forward to finishing it !
all i can say is this is a must see - a hilarious film you can truly watch over and over again . : )

this movie has a plot and good acting . russell crowe play robin hood to the `` t '' . i would recommend this movie and think you will enjoy it .

a great asian action thriller . acting was very good . nice story line . enjoyed the costumes and scenery . i was not disappointed .

my sister loves any movie with colin firth in it . i am going to give it to her for mothers day . i was so glad to be able to find it and such a great price .
liked this movie much more than i thought i would . the story is original , the ending unexpected , and holds up to repeated viewing .
the dvd that you sent was bad , that did not make my day very good , so i did not like the dvd . roberts
i really liked this new show and enjoyed watching it again on dvd . it turns out i did n't even realize i missed some episodes . i plan on purchasing season two as well .

my son was so interested in seeing this movie after seeing the book at a doctor 's office . he has been thrilled with the quality and the story !
movie is for the grand daughter , she 's just over 2 and it 's her favorite character and it teaches the young one to get along with others

the movie was visually awesome and a great story plot that somehow seemed to flow with the beatles music ! you wo n't regret it !
i have used it once . it is very easy to use , and it seemed to make my tv pictures much clearer .
first movie better think jennifer acting getting to her head she is good in this one the plot / location was lacking more woody next movie -- lots more woody less jennifer

my grandchildren and i love this movie , we have watched it several times on family movie nights . we love disney movies .
a great show that watch more then once a year and still keeps me laughing my head off ! very nice !
i love this movie , the actors and actress 's are some of my favorite . i am glad i purchased this movie .
i 'm not much of a sport guy but this was an interesting and true story . it 's also nice to see that there are people out in the world that still care about others .
how can anyone not like these three ladies in their prime ? the story is top notch - something we could watch once in a while for the rest of our lives .
thought this was just plain fun . it was light , true and pretty realistic . nice to watch a movie that was light , not depressing , with no violence , sex or darkness .
the coen brothers make some of the best movies , and this is one of their best . a definite buy .
i watch this movie very often , like once a month . great family movie , great story , and morals in the movie . watch with your family .
i had the pleasure of reading the book first ... the movie was good , but i still think the book was better .
usually , when i watch this kind of movie it 's because i 'm lazy and do n't want to have to think . it helped me pass the time , but it was highly predictable .
this movie was bought as a gift for someone else who i had told about the movie . as far as the quality of the movie it was in great shape .
i love these episodes . spongebob is a great cartoon character that i can watch over and over all day long .
this is a really bad remake of the original . while the first one is a classic with a great story line and good acting , this one is cheesy .
not one of the better animated computer generated movies . however i received the blu-ray disc very quickly .
this was a cute movie and it had issues as a childhood brothers would have . one grew up and the other still not .
i am a huge matthew mcconaughey fan but lets fact a fact , this movie was disappointing . he is so much better than this !
this is a great movie ! i am glad to have it as part of my collection .
i loved it but i can not save it . and it was not very clear . i do n't know if it is my computer or not ?
i enjoyed the movie but it was a little slow . it was a bunch of good actors in a movie . seemed a little thrown together .
sweet but boring little story . good actors but they did n't have much to work with on this script . too bad because it could have been a nice family film
the 60s brought great movies , suitable for all ages . and they did n't come out every other day , either . tony curtis - hero , good guy , and ladies man .
omg ! he now loves lighting mcqueen . even had to get him a race car bed . fun movie , even as an adult i enjoyed watching .
there is nothing like a classic black & white movie with stars and a story ! ! do n't miss it -- a real feel-good movie !
really enjoyed this movie , to me it was better than the first movie . if you saw the first one you need to see this one also .
you can never go wrong with audie murphy . what a fantastic actor . we are busy trying to complete our audie murphy collection and are glad we found this film . excellent .
i actually bought this season for my grandson . he loved one particular episode and would n't be happy until he could watch it with his friends . spongebob is great for kids .
the disc came with no scratches . also it looks like the picture . kinda surprised that a movie with no plot would be entertaining .
i have seen this story several times and enjoyed this one as well as the others . good job on aging the actors .
i saw this with my dad and i wanted to share with my son . i recommend amazon for most all my movie purchases . i get them usually within a week , that is awesome !
love the garfield holiday specials ! ! they are fun and unique to each holiday ! ! love the songs ! ! garfield and the gang are sure to bring a smile to your holiday : - )
a wonderful blend of actors and animation . the story of heroes is always enjoyable , especially those of heroes overlooked in their time .
i liked this . i laughed out loud many times . it 's more of a silly slower moving , witty humor . if you like that this movie is fun
this movie was kind of disappointing for me i really expected alot , and maybe that was my problem . despite all this matthew perry and bruce willis provide enough laughs to make it worth renting .
really enjoyed this dvd . it is action packed and full of great acting . this is a classic movie . i would recommend the purchase of this movie .
my wife loves this series and has gotten me into it also . we are buying the rest of the series as it becomes available .
definitely recommend this upbeat spy drama , love that has enough humor to make it fun too watch , not too dark
i really enjoyed the story line and the laughs that went along with this movie . great for the kids as well ! good , clean fun !
nice movie , will watch it again , enjoyed watching it , funny witty lines and interesting plot , all i all a great sunday afternoon movie
i could sit here and watch this show all day long ! i was happy to be able to find the whole collection of episodes in one place
classic henry fonda movie set back in the depression and what families went through , must see for entire family .
if you like action movies , this one is for you . effects are out of this world . cast performance and story are very good .
my wife and i love this show ! ! the later seasons have a lot more death and poor language which we could do without . well written , always funny , and incredibly entertaining .
this is a movie that my family loved . kids will enjoy watching this again and again . very entertaining and funny . loved it .
this movie did measure up to the original movie . i liked the original much better . but it was worth watching once .
excellent movie and acting . you get in the movie and this a movie you dont want to end . worth buying and watching over and over
there is no sign of madea here . a very good movie . well done . great storyline , well written . i loved everything about this movie .
i love this movie . highly recommend this movie to everyone . one of the greatest movies ever .
i seem to forget about this movie during the holidays but this year i did n't . fun movie that people of all ages can enjoy .
the hero is portrayed by one of our favorite actors . we watched all of the available season and wish there were more
one of the worst movies that i have ever seen . the film quality was very poor , and it did not make since .
it 's not the original but i still liked it and i will watch it again . would rather have digital download then ultraviolet though
an interesting movie about life on board a submarine during wwii . all in all it 's a fairly typical submarine movie with a typical plot . acting was well done and scenes were realistic .
i own almost all of his movies and i was a little upset that this was not a movie but it was good ... i 'll keep it , it was interesting .
bought it for the kids i enjoyed it too great 3d would add it to your 3d collection good pop in and out
not the best acting ... somewhat predictable . i wanted to see this dvd after another review but , hey , it just was n't what i thought it would be .
thought these were so cute and funny . bought when amazon running two for one . they do n't seem to have those anymore .
it was cute and fun to watch . the quality was very good and the animation was good . everyone will like it .
i purchased this mainly for the movie the night they saved christmas , but we also enjoyed the other holiday movies in the collection .
any time a movie becomes a franchise it will wear out its welcome , but the first hangover was definitely a great comedy .
i got the box set and i love it . i like the artwork and dvd is the best . but i love all of the csi shows .
jamie fox was so good playing ray . the entire story and the music were very good for the entire family .
i enjoyed the movie very much . if you liked the harry potter series at all , you 'll like this movie . filled with action and lots of magical fighting , how can you go wrong ?
i really enjoyed this series . the actors were so real doing their parts . story line was great . looking forward to next season .
three great actors loved everything about this movie one we will enjoy time and time again bob australia
this series is so engaging , well written and well acted that it should have gone on for years longer . how about a reunion show ?
cute movie watched it on tv now i ordered it love the cast . mom and dad watch first to see if it is good for your kids
season three is great , action packed . i just ca n't watch one episode . i end up watching 3 or 4 at a time . i ca n't wait to see what happens next .
a classic film that stands the test of time . these actors knew how to tell a story and hold one 's attention .
i love all movies with sam elliott . i also love the solid content of the older western movies . it was an easy movie to watch .
this show surprised me , not having any interest in politics , i find the storyline keeps my interest . i think the casting for this program was excellent .
this was an ok movie , not a keeper in my way of thinking , but a nice , pleasant movie . if you like a pleasant movie to watch , this is it .
one of the better made for tv movies ... sad , but happy at the same time . i think i liked the story-line better than the actual movie itself .
my family loves this film , fun and well paced . steve martin is great , as usual , and the story line has kept my kids interested from a very young age .
i 'm not quite as captivated as i was with seasons 1 and 2 , but it 's beautifully portrayed as a costume drama . i like it .
this is one i had n't seen in years and wanted to buy for my children to watch . it is n't as terrible as today 's movies .
first episode of first season was ok but i know they got funnier as the show went along . it was neat to be able to watch it free on the kindle fire .
great movie and reminder that we complain way to much and not thankful for what we do have . need to thankful for what you do have first .
i do n't know about you but killing a bunch of people makes this movie more realistic do n't know why people said it was bad i think it was one of the best transformers movies yet ...
this would have been a good family movie if it was n't for the one curse word in it . not sure why they could n't have left it out .
while this movie is filled with awesome visual effects that will leave most happy , it seemed to lose something that made the original movies so memorable . still , true star wars fans will be pleased .
i love watching movies that are based on true stories . i know they have to add some extra drama that did n't really happen , but it adds excitement . this was a great movie for race fans !
the best real life drama i have seen in years it is one of my favorite movies it took some time to find it on dvd have worn out the vhs tape i had of this movie .
one of kurt russell 's favorite movies , mine to , really gritty and dark , for today 's standards they could do more , but back in the day it was ground breaking .
this is a classic of a movie and will be one to remember in the future of a family with the catholic church and what is right and wrong .
it works great and i 'm glad they got back on track with the story . you will not be let down .
while the ship model was trash the rest of the movie was good . what do you expect for a man directing this with hardly any budget
absolutely great family movie . what a gem . they do n't make these kinds of movies enough anymore . watched it twice with the kids
many many subtle plots . a great movie for teenagers to watch and learn about honesty and integrity . good beats evil .
he plays both a scary heavy , then went to a great comedian . he 's great on snl . i recieved it fast and in great shape .
totally awesome show ! i highly recommend it to any and everyone who enjoys science fiction with a story line included .
good action movie . lots of good actors . not the best movie i have ever watched but definitely entertaining . worth watching once .
i have always been used to tyler perry making plays and stuff . he really played his part wonderfully . this movie was full of action and had a great story behind it .
this is a great movie , we enjoyed as much as original movie . highly recommended for any age group to watch
this season is where it starts to get good because brenda left . she was terrible ...
this sequel is even better than the first one . very intense and the directors style is most unique . watch it over and over .
magic mike ( channing tatum ) was a hit , all the way ! hope to see much more of this sexy man ! so , yeah , great movie , good buy !
i only watched a few minutes of this video . when someone was killed that soon in the movie , i just did n't want to watch the rest .
the dvd arrived promptly and in good condition ; it 's a great movie for us old guys with some of our favorite folks playing their best parts .
this is a really great family movie , it has got a great message in it . five stars all the way ! ! ! !
it 's funny , but i ca n't watch it , because my dog watches tv too , and jumps at the tv trying to attack the animals on the show .
these appear to have been remastered , i own the dvd 's of this and this is such and improvement in video quality ! ! !
saw this movie at the theater , and it was really good , so i had to buy it when it came out on dvd .
i love the movie , so for me is great to have in my library . got it at a great price in exact condition as described .
overall it was a decent enough movie . it really needed to be about 10 minutes longer and wrap a few things up . the original was better .
so awesome ! ! ! worth every penny and i keep watching it over and over again ! ! i hope there will be many more movies like this ! ! !
i enjoyed the dog who saved christmas it is a good family movie anytime of the year i recommend it to everyone
one of our grandsons favorite movies . love to watch him view it and see how excited he gets . recommend to others . .
this movie was not what i was expecting and i do not recommend it to anyone unless you like this kind of humor .
this movie was a gift for my daughter . she now has the complete set for the mummy series . we all enjoy watching these movies .
this is an awesome series . my husband loved it . a bit much for foul language but humorous all the same . lol : )
this is a fun take on an old story . you will enjoy the tale and the excitement throughout . this is a great twist on an old tale .
the blu ray version is just stunning and worth watching . makes watching things at home in high def great and enjoyable .
this is a fun movie and it 's great for being mindless . the first one is way better but this was a fun follow up .
i loved this movie since the first time i watched it and it was a great price for my money . : o )
he thinks this is a classic movie and watches regularly . for him it is pure entertainment and the actors are great .
i watched only the first episode and that was enough . the main story lines were vampires are cool and i ca n't wait to have sex with one .
read the book , wanted to see the book . this book written so many years ago is true to todays world .
this has to be one of keanu reeves 's best movies since the matrix . this movie is a really good drama . this is a must see film .
this movie is a great movie a christmas classic to me me and my family have always enjoyed watching it and glad to have it on dvd i still have on vhs
this is well written and the acting is superb ! i highly recommend this series . it 's interesting to live through the war with these characters . all the story lines pull you in from the very beginning .
she loves this movie and i 've lost track how many times she 's watched it and sings to it every single time .
this must be the funniest dvd on the planet , but is this complete ? i read somewhere that it should be over 90 minutes , is this correct ?
you can believe that this man really lived and had some of the adventures this movie portrays . the photography is great .
we have loved this movie since it came out , so we were very happy to find a dvd in very good shape at a reasonable price . we will be shopping here more often .
the story is good , the action was great , you must buy this movie , it will not let you down love to have his power .
not as good as expected but still entertaining . tommy lee jones excellent . sensitive subjects but handled very nicely . enjoy it .
diane keaton is great as always and the movie has some great twists in it , funny , sweet & a tad sad .
i am the biggest batman fan ever , seeing him show emotions is a rare sight and that episode did just that .
what more can i say . this is simply a great christmas movie for the whole family .
nice to see the big stars putting together a show for the kids , well done for the kids and adults will find some humor along the way .
be sure to have the time to sit down , a little long but well worth the time spent to watch .
i 've been wanting this series on dvd , and finally got them at a price i could afford . the shipping and quality were excellent ! !
the movie was very good and the actors and plot was good . they could put in a better ending . i would highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes action .
do n't waste your time on this one , terrible story line lousy acting kind of looks like it was done by a group of teenagers putting together a movie ... ...
it was a great movie . i loved it . i saw it years ago and decided i wanted it in my home movie collection . i would recommend it to all .
i loved this series its the only one i did like . we just started watching it tonight . its funny and relaxing . a great show
loved this show when it was on the air in the 80s and love to watch this series over and over . very funny and a different version of bruce that you will enjoy
this movie was different than i thought and in a good way had me wondering what was going on until the very end . it was very good and recommend it for a family to watch .
i thought it was a really good movie . there were good actors , lots of action , and the story actually made sense even if it was a little bit unrealistic .
i have all of the star wars dvd 's now and i 'm very happy , thank you so much . do n't ask me again
these old classic disney movies are the greatest . my family really enjoyed this movie and my husband & i got to relive our time of watching it when we were kids . great movie !
i never did buy this when it first came out so i bought it to add to my collection . i like the actors in it and i like the storyline . the shipping was also very fast .
i could watch this movie over and over ! i cried for almost the entire last hour of this movie . . . will be watching this again and again !
i love this show . i wish it will run longer though . good cast and good twist . i love watching it through amazon prime , free of commercials .
this is the best version of king kong i have seen . the upgrade in advanced photography is excellent .
this was not tim burton 's or johnny depp 's best . i found it way too campy and hard to watch . sorry .
this was a must have for our dvd collection . great movies that brought back lots of memories from me younger years .
you have to watch this through once and do n't let anyone tell you about it first .
i like anything bruce willis is in , lots of action , do not like the r rated parts , takes away from the movie art of it . makes any movie lower class .
good family movie ! as a fan of the old japanese scifi movies ( godzilla , etc . ) this was a fun movie to watch .
my family likes this movie . i gave it 4 out of 5 only because there are some movies that are funnier to our family . it 's a cute movie that has its funny moments .
for those of you who have read the book save your money . you will be greatly disappointed , most of the good parts were left out . i wish i could get my money back
i ca n't wait to watch this classic movie with our daughter . it is a nice addition to our movie library .
this is the movie that brought back the die hard series as relevant action series . one for the collection of dvds
with these three stars how can a movie miss . we loved it . the writing could have been better , but the great acting made up for it .
i am sure the movie is good , however i have yet to see the entire movie . purchase the movie today .
was an ok movie . i really would n't go to the movies to see it though .
i saw many of my favorite stars in a comical light this movie was funny and i will enjoy watching it again and again .
i bought this movie because i like patrick stewart . the movie was just awful . i would bet that stewart is not proud of this one .
i also reviewed season 1. enjoyed this season as much as the first . well written plots , interesting twists , more character development . ca n't wait to start season 3
very interesting movie with good stars . had a lot of twists and turns and did n't turn out the way that you thought it should .
touching story of a disjointed father and his daughter , played beautifully by both fonda 's . kate hepburn , too , was excellent , as always .
it came on time . it is a good watch and i dont have any complaints about it . it is in excellent condition . i am very pleased .
i ordered this for myself and a family member and we all loved the movie ( it was very well made ) but the message was outstanding !
i had a difficult time getting into it and i gave it as long as i could before i just could not take it any more and turned it off about 10 minutes in .
very fast shipping and item was in great condition and just as described by the seller .
this is a good movie ! ! i love liam neeson and he did n't let me down in this movie . a great watch ! !
this film was a let down , the story line was not there . i would not recommend this film to anyone .
borrowed back and enjoyed it myself . lots of noise and action so the kids liked it and watched it twice
it is a series like no other , it takes time to get used to but once you do it is a very good series , i have all 4 seasons now . : o )
this is one of the 90 's best ! this collection is awesome , and having all seven seasons to watch anytime is just great . i highly recommend this to any boy meets world fan !
the movie trailer was the best part of the movie . the movie was slow , boring and a waste of time to watch . the ending was the only good part .
what a great romance . i watched it when i was younger and i think i enjoy it even more now . it was such a moving story that your heart just goes out to the characters .
love watching this movie and now i have it for my own . drew barrymore and the rest of the cast are wonderful . the story is great . i love .
this was a good deal for the price ... i love all these movies and there were no scratches or skipping , yay !
my husband and i watched this movie and really enjoyed it . it was a wonderful story line and so well acted .
really enjoyed the movie lots of action and comedy can be enjoyed by all the family i would recommend this
there is so much going on in todays politics that we do not know . this book brings out some of the mystery about this man . i hope that more people read it and believe what is said .
it was okay but with all the hype put out about this movie it was a bit of a let down when i actually saw it . i would have hoped for a lot more .
suspenseful , but not well done . no build up to a thrilling end . i do not recommend this movie at all .
this was well written and well played with twists , turns and then an unforgettable center that was not what i had anticipated .
this is probably the best series ever . the acting is excellent , the scenery realistic , and the action breathtaking .
i love mel 's humor . this set captures many of his best . the special gold box price i paid made me purchase this set after considering it a while .
great characters and appropriate family story lines , love the humor and morals ... enjoy watching what i grew up watching with my daughter .
i used to love this show . the episodes are still funny to me and it has been a great blast from the past to watch .
my husband and i watched this movie together and enjoyed it tremendously . you will not be disappointed ... watch it with your family ... they will love it too .
really if you have to read this you never watched this movie . it 's a classic . and it 's dirty dancing . : d
this movie was movie was moving about a real thing that happened loved it would like to see more like it
this series brings back memories of my childhood when we used to watch wholesome programs . this one is so cute and once again i am able to enjoy it .
enjoyed watching it . everyone is so young . a keeper . well done . i hate this having to have so many words .
great bargain and shipping was fast . the grand kids love the movies and so do i. the colors in this movie are so lively and colorful .
this anime is fun but you need to watch the first season before you watch it . i hope you enjoy it . : )
the price of the dvd was good and the delivery time was excellent . the dvd is in really good condition and i 'm happy with my purchase . would certainly use this seller again .
you should get this movie . one of the greatest movies of the series .
i rate this the second greatest series after lost . so much happens it keeps you on the edge of your seat at all times . never a dull moment .
just what the doctor ordered . packaging , quality all as expected . if i get into buying dvd collections again and jump at the chance , but i am all digital now .
this is a good comedy . it is for an adult audience due to sexual situations . it is nothing like the original dark shadows .
interesting pairing of a young mark harmon with film legend , elizabeth taylor . while the story line was unusual , the acting was superb !
this is a movie which i missed when it first came out , and always wanted to see it . i love the story and the acting , even if it is clearly no longer a contemporary movie .
i love werewolves and vampires . this was a little different than the usual and i enjoyed it .
great movie ! it was awesome to see a part of history that i knew little about . very well directed and acted ! it will keep you on the edge of your seat ! i highly recommend it !
an absolute classic ! what more can i say ! you have to look to the past to find some of the best movies ever made .
the absolute best planet of the apes collection , it is that much better in blu ray . if you like the planet of the apes then this collection is a must have .
it 's a funny movie with great animation . the minions are awesome and kind of steal the show . adults seem to like it as much as kids .
this is something i have been looking for for over a year . husband extremely happy to get this long wished for movie .
i have been trying to find this in the stores for a while , but no luck . got this for my mom and she loved it .
never received movie from the seller . but , i have seen the movie before and it is a great movie . worth the price and worth the watch . hope to own it myself soon .
this looked like it would be an enjoyable movie . it was on last week on tcm but i missed most of it . what i did see , i enjoyed .
dissapointed ... i return it but no answer yet ... .the problem was that another movie played instead of the one i order ... .but the case was title correct ... and no phone to call and complaint
we really enjoyed it . very entertaining for all of our family , mostly adults now . it has action , interesting story line , some humor , and clean language .
this show has been the greatest on tv . watched it when it was on tv years ago . glad to see it on dvd . watching the whole episode all over again after so many years .
just love the story behind this movie . glad that i have it as part of my collection that i have with my other favorite movies .
bones is an all around great show ! the character dynamics have changed for this season , and it is just as lovely as always !
some episodes are better than others , but each one leaves you wanting more . well developed characters and multiple , but equally interesting , story lines . a very entertaining and thought provoking .
i really did n't know what to expect from this film , but i really enjoyed it , another winner from ken russell
with the high customer rating and a good trailer , i had high expectations for this movie but i was greatly disappointed . the movie is quite slow . at best it is an average movie ,
i loved the action , not too much , and the characters were entertaining . i would watch the movie again in the future .
i feel pretty much the same as i felt about the first season . good show for those who like mystery & murder mystery .
purchased all of these for my granddaughter 's birthday . she loved them . the dvd 's arrived in great shape with fast service .
i 'd watch this again soon . great action , thrills , and a good story to boot . i 'd keep an eye on the new guy .
after waiting for so long at last we have a masterpiece with good sound and a very good picture . a dvd you must own .
fantastic , that 's all i can say . 5 star tv . swedish version of the usa & # 34 ; the killing & # 34 ; . gritty crime drama , you wo n't see anywhere else .
i was sorry to hear of his passing . there are very few shows like this any more , interesting , make u think some , and have a little humor .
lots of actions not too bad for a bunch of old guys , do n't know what happened to steven segal , he 's not in it .
i love music and dance . it does n't matter what type as long as it is good dancing . one day i 'll be the star .
i bought this for my grandchildren at their request , and it held their attention , which is really hard to do these days . cute story .
what can i say , amazon always comes threw when it comes to the prices . the product was in its original packaging and in great condition when arrived . not to mention this is a great film .
one of their best episodes . it is an episode that even people who never saw the series find very funny . a thanksgiving day tradition !
this is a great movie . i love denzel washington and this movie has a lot of action scenes . i would recommend it to anyone .
awesome story line good acting with the 2 main characters , very funny have to see it with friends and such
excellent all around . good story with good morals and values . good color and picture quality . i loved it and would recommend it for all audiences .
not what i had expected but in a good way , really funny . i would buy this on dvd for sure .
unbelievable but a true story . my wife and i have watched it many time . it is a sad story but hard to believable that it could be true .
i would recommend this series to anyone who loves a good mystery ... ... have watched them several times ... ... ... good actors and good plots ... ...
i would recommend this movies to all my friend . this movie has suspense , drama and some comedy . an outstanding movie classic .
love any movie that diane keaton is , and it was fun seeing her so young . the movie was a little wacky at times , but still entertaining .
much better than i expected . stallone and arnold are still a great team . great for a movie night when you ca n't decide on something , this will do nicely .
the alfred hitchcock collection is great it has 5 of his best movies in it all the movies in this collection are all classics . and they are all in bluray .
one of the greatest movies of all time ... buy it ! it just might save your life !
would have been better if step by step how to dance in bonus features , still good movie , good story line , great songs .
this was a very creepy , well-done movie . the characters were very convincing and the concept was quite clever . thoroughly entertaining .
in my top three ( 3 ) shows ever on television . every show is new with a great storyline . i love this show !
it has keanu reeves in it ... so gave it a shot : ) it 's entertaining all the way : ) on time delivery and well packaged !

i am a huge fan of clark gable and wanted this movie for my collection .
this was and is still a great show with a great cast . with all the other old tv shows making it to dvd , they need to start releasing season sets of this spectacular show .

what can i say other than this is an anime classic . i loved this anime and am excited that a movie 's on the way . the ending made me cry .
my girlfriend suggested we watch this . i think she enjoyed it or at least understood it . as for me ? i 'm still lost ...
i purchased this since i love south park . normal south park not a big deal but still funny to watch .
did not watch it because we were not expecting a cartoon but a movie with real people . not in the mood for a cartoon .
pretty good . has some really funny moments but i did n't enjoy it as much as his previous films .
the quality of the dvd and the movie itself are both great . it 's one of the best in my hammer horror collection .
love all 3 stars in this movie , damon does a great job in the movie , had been searching for a while for this , at a reasonable price
this is probably my favorite season in the franchise . paris and nicole are amazingly hilarious and the jobs they are forced to do are even more so !
i have loved this since i was a kid and now my kids love it ! enjoyable , suspenseful , and full of action . it 's a must have !
great series plus it was sold at a fair price . it will give me the opportunity to watch those programs which i missed during its time on tv .

i have this set of disks that do n't work why do i have to have bad disks do you stand behind this
the wwe is very fun , but making the time to follow it can be challenging . this looks like ( have n't watched it yet ) a good compilation of wwe video .
i saw , this movie 2 times one , in theatres the other on video , good movie and sad ... read , the book you 'll like , it even if your not a stephen king fan .
it was a good price for what i got and also it came in on time and it was not a bad movie .
memories of child hood just did n't do me justice . still a good series to watch
really long , but really worth it . if you have n't seen the extended versions of these movies , you missed a lot .
was a young child during this time so it was interesting and informative insight on how we dealt with the cold war times .
this movie is so good and so necessary ! we do n't all have to be the same to be very special !
this was bought as a gift for my kid who loved it . they do n't make shows like this anymore ! great packaging and quality . a very happy purchase .
this movie was n't bad for a remake . they do get a little out of hand with the language . all in all good

this is a very good movie . a simple story that comes alive because of a great cast . two thumbs up !
i 'm really glad i stumbled upon this dvd . it 's hard to find a dvd with more than one old school cartoon . they need to have more of these .
i highly recommend this video . it is well done . you have to see it and judge for yourself . sad ending .
you have to see to believe this collection by william castle , its awesome . he has his own style . i really was impressed with his stories , direction and characters . great fun .
great movie with an unexpected ending . although there are some parts of the plot which seems to be missing to complete the whole idea of it .
it was still quite entertaining . jeff bridges and ryan reynolds make a good team and work well together as far as their roles in this film . interesting that they even made this movie but it was entertaining .

as usual , all of the older walt disney films are special and this is no exception . i bought it for my 2 young grandchildren , but sit and watch it with them .
this is an awesome sequel to the first . the kids love it just as much and gives me a break from watching the first one over and over .
i have watched this movie over and over especially when i needed inspiration or thought i needed a better perspective on things .
acting is wonderful , and the sets and costumes are awesome . just a delight of a movie .
this was a christmas gift for my girlfriend and she loved it watches it all the time with her husband
this man is always funny and is a good comedy . very good comedy and he always keeps you laughing . watch it .
i bought this movie for one of my sisters and she loves it , she watches it with her grandchildren and says it is a good family movie
the movie was alright , but i think it was more on the level of a teenagers movie rather than an adult movie .
i loved this movie and the theme and the actors . wonderful entertainment . watched it very closely right to the end .
it 's comic book pictures with very little animation . wish i never purchased it ! i do not recommend this to anyone !
i just love watching touched by an angel series ! i wish they would release the other five seasons ! !
i gave this as a birthday gift for a die hard fan of the series . he is very satisfied with the image quality and the special features . highly recommended .
you have to get season 2 but not sure if you have to have season 3. the new spartacus tries to be like the original actor but barely .
what a great series this is ! i love it ! it arrived on time and in perfect condition ! i am addicted to this show !
this movie has no real plot , no action , and terrible acting . i kept waiting for something , anything to happen , but it never did . i want my time back .
really enjoyed this one ... an old one with great values that really stands the test of time . sad the actors are n't with us any longer .
once you see it you are hooked . this is so funny and original . plus the singing is great and catchy .
i 've loved the show from day 1. season 6 disappointed me a bit , but season 7 helped get it back on track !
just could not get into the movie . guess some folks will like it , me ? i did not think that much about it .
my husband & i loved this series ! it 's easy to get all wrapped up in the characters .
loved the movie . i always enjoy watching it . i can never get tired of watching the movie .
this movie is very funny but also very touching . would recommend this movie to everyone who loves a good movie .
what 's not to love about downton abbey ? the costumes are stunning and historically accurate . the actors are masterful . and the writing is compelling and heartbreaking .
some people understand this movie and some people do n't . either you like it do or do n't , i like this movie and that is just my opinion .
strange story line , but totally predictable ... when i 'm in the mood for a good chick flick i love predictable ! love the interactions between characters . very true to life .
i grew up watching this show and enjoy it very much . i like clint walker as an actor and think he could have been the character in real life from his performance .
this entire series is super great for the entire family to watch together . we get many laughs with this one .
just not my sense of humor ! felt it was n't very funny at all , and thought the story line sort of dragged .
the language was n't as bad as i expected it to be . not for young people to watch . my husband and his guy friends thought this was the funniest movie they had seen in years .
i do n't know how i missed this really great old film ! i 'm glad it is back out and i can have it in my collection !
i wish i had starting watching the day it came out . no commercials is a bonus . do n't wait . start watching .
seriously . do you have to say anything else ? that 's really what sold me on the series in the first place .

a good , though not very deep thriller . worth a watch , but do n't buy it .
great action . i love the pure good and evil of the story . a repeat watch will be necessary because i might have missed something .
at some point , you would have thought someone would have realized that none of this was going to come together ...
this movies is too funny , sandra bullock , betty white , ryan reynolds mad a good team is this movie , when sandra dance its too funny .

24 is one of the best tv shows ever made . it sucks you in from the beginning and does n't let go . i ca n't wait for this summer to see season 9 .

i love this tv show i use to watch it when i was little and i am happy it came out on dvd
bought a copy for myself and one for a gift . nice to have it around to enjoy when we want to watch a movie with good eye candy , but no plot !
after viewing season 1 , could n't wait to see this one . the dress and history are great to relive that period .
i liked it very much . i have been trying to find concert footage of this band for quit a while . it was not a disappointment .
i liked it . but i am in to the whole zombie thing so i guess i would . i was pleasantly surprised though . it was actually well done .

can not rate the movie , i didnt watch it and i bought it as a gift for someone that i worked with
this was a great movie about a great man . well acted , it might have been a bit long but still worth watching .
it was an okay movie . however i gave it three stars due to the ending of the story . plus it was too long before they got to the real action . also too gory .
i expected the movie to be in color rather than black and white when i reviewed the movie before purchasing it stated that it was in color so that is why i purchased it .
the music man is a wonderful movie , good story , good music , good acting . it is a movie that can be seen more than once and greatly enjoyed very time .
a movie with a story , crisp and witty . i enjoyed the characters and would see it again . two thumbs up
watched five minutes and turned it off . i 'm not found of foul language throughout a movie . total waste of my money . .
just not for everyone subject matter not what i expected . was hoping for a funny movie . would be for adults only since it deal with sex
this was a very interesting , thought provoking movie ! good cast , good story . i wish hollywood would make more like it !
ok movie . nothing really special but has some good moments and not bad .
i love all of the harry potter books and have not seen all of the movies but this one was very good and close to the book

this is a scary but great movie & # 62 ; it is awesome . then you think there really are people in the world that are like this , then it 's scary .
i appreciate the first three and do n't care much for the fourth but they all beat predator sequels and those awful alien vs predator movies !
this is a very entertaining movie . i enjoyed every minute of it . a must see movie . thank you so much .
this is a hysterical movie . it is even better on dvd . everyone should see this movie . it makes you realize just what can happen when you have too much time on your hands ! lol !
it 's a cute family film . it teaches that sometimes it 's good to be different , even if people are n't that nice about it . very entertaining .

bought this for my son and he is trying to get all seasons . came in a timely fashion and at a good price .

great overall movie christina can sing great and her moves are great . everything work together great . cher is at her best like always
i 've always like this first animated tarzan movie . the kids like it too . disney knows how to entertain kids of all ages .
i love the anime . i am 19 and study anime and film , but when i watch fairy tail i always feel like a little child again : )
this added to her set and now she is very happy , thanks . look forward to using this site in the future to order more stuff .
seasons 3 thru 7 of this were fantastic and amazon prime allows me to relive these episodes anytime i want .
i actually watch the first one love it and yeah so i was wondering how many movie were there so i check out on amazon to get it because it not at the store because the movie is old !
looking forward to watch this movie all over again . it is so funny how little they were before series time ... i love old fashioned lifestyle ! thanks .
my kids love every shrek movie . this is no exception . they were able to keep it funny and entertaining , just like the first one . we actually like this one better than the 3rd .
great movie , kept me laughing ! ca n't wait to see the new movie with mccarthy and bullock . very different from comedies nowadays . reminded me of old school comedy .
excellent family series . i bought them all ! love the bbc family stories . i love the acting in this movie . excellent cast .
gave as a christmas gift to my son . good value ca n't really speak to the quality of the videos though .
kids today just do n't know what real cartoons are or about . they have no idea just how fun it is to watch are real cartoon .
love the movie . love anything patrick swayze played in . demi moore was excellent in this movie . i cried all the way thru .
i found this movie disturbing so i did n't watch it the whole way . maybe it got better but would not try to watch it the whole way through again .
this was even more like the books than the originals . the characters and the background information were very well done .
a nice movie and i also liked the extras that were added . it really was cute and interesting . love the digital copy
for some reason i did n't finish watching the story . do n't know if it was me or the movie . others may enjoy it .
this brings back a lot of childhood memories ! i loved this series of cartoons , bought and it was the best thing ever . now i need to grab the rest of the seasons to complete my collection .
even if i could try to explain this film , it wo n't be enough . it ca n't be explained . it 's beautiful art .
i was n't really expecting much out of this movie but quickly found out it was funny and entertaining . great comedy action flick . saw it on instant amazon and quality came in perfectly .
interesting characters , a good storyline , and funny at times too ; this was more of a drama than a comedy , and had a good moral to the story .
horrible dvd ! what a waste of money ! no one that has watched it has ever watched the complete movie ! absolute garbage !
my daughter and son both love this dora movie . animals and dora , could it get any better ? they do n't think so ! : )
the price was a little high but i ca n't really except less since i bought a christmas movie 2 weeks before christmas but otherwise i have had no problems with it
this is one of the most underrated horror movies of all time . there is n't much to be said besides watch this movie if you have n't seen it yet .
i really enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to anyone . well worth the money spent . it 's an all round feel good movie
it was an interesting movie . very sad but different . surprise after surprise . good photography . too much time smoking as many directors think is necessary for some unknown reason .
my favorite halloween movie just the best of everything . fun historical facts , dark humor , creepy characters and just the right amount of blood and violence .
the movie was comical with some romance thrown in for good measure . i liked it . quirky , but cool . worth the rental price .
good price and bought it for the digital copy . i 've seen it a few times now when traveling and never disappoints .
it 's a typical barbie movie so mom and dad are not thrilled but if you are a 6 year old girl it 's the best movie ever . : )
my boyfriend loves richard pryor and he was not dissapointed when i gave him this . we watched it and had a good laugh . he really enjoyed it !
love this movie , one of the best of early bruce willis . could watch over and over again . highly recommend viewing .
good and complete ending , from beginning to end i have watched with anticipation the story unfold as to what will happen , and how this will all end .
great ! the only thing that i still have n't got use to the menu at the front instead of playing the movie without having to make choice first .
this movie was very enjoyable . was very entertaining to watch , and i ca n't say that about too many movies anymore . would recommend for a light , entertaining movie night .
okay i find tom and cameron annoying as a people , yes that is right , but this film rocked it big ! fun fun fun ... what a ride . a must see ! !
it was a good addition to the bourne trilogy . the movie followed the book pretty good . i would recommend this to add to your movie collection .
thank you for helping to complete my collection of & # 34 ; bones ' seasons . my granddaughters and i like to watch them together .
as a big fan if the books i was excited to see this played out on screen . disappointed that many important aspects were changed from the book , but overall it was entertaining .
all three were good movies , but of course my reason for buying it was color of night ! the price was very reasonable and the quality was new !
great idea to put both movies on 1 dvd . both are excellent movies .
the special effects are fantastic . the grandchildren love to watch the movie . we have watched it about 5 times already
i was n't sure how good this movie was going to be , but it turned out to be a great story . i really enjoy this movie .
awesome movie . great acting , action and story line . hard to believe it 's all a true story . funny how reality can be so crazy . i would highly recommend this movie .
yeah nothing but good things to say about this movie love it watch it over and over , was a great find on here for a great price
this movie was great , my children watched this when they were younger and now our grandchildren like it as well . great movie .
this move is my most favorite , it is a true story and i just wonderful . i watch it all the time , ca n't get enough
here are two great shows for the family that will become classics in your household at christmas . disney out did themselves with these two shows .
great movie or mini series and it should be a classic for sure . would recommend this western to anyone . robert duvall and tommy lee jones were great together .
this movie although written as fiction is probably the most realistic picture of the times that we live in . i will definitely be buying part 2. it was well worth the money .
this is an excellent series . very good actors , good costumes and the story takes you back to the period . it is very interesting and i can hardly wait for each new episode
what 's better than julia roberts and richard gere ? ? this is one of my favorite movies . this was a good buy too . ca n't beat that ! !
i like the original sharon stone and michael douglas acted good together . the new story is exciting or interesting like the original .
i bought this movie just because i did not have the opportunity to watch it at the cinema . i was really impressed how good it its . great story , great picture , great sound .
my sister asked me to buy this . she is 9 years old and loves disney films ... i remember watching this when i was a kid too .
the mission impossible movies are great action movies and tom cruise is one of the best action actors of all-time .
loved the movie and russell crowe . lots of action and great cinematography . well worth owning on blu ray which made the action sequences much better than ordinary dvd .
great movie , love tom hanks & julie roberts . very fitting story for the times , a must see flick . tom hanks does a great job of acting once again ... .
good to view but the young set do not appreciate it like we did in our younger days .
wasted some time watching this . i skipped most of it after 15 minutes of watching . dumb , please do n't waste your time .
bad movie all the way through , poor acting not scary did not enjoy at all would never rent are watch again .
another great classic movie . i remember when this first came out and i liked it then and i still like it .
although the animation is great as always , this story is not my favorite of all the tinker bell movies . but young children will enjoy it anyway .
they did a good job of acting like they always do and the storyline is very good . very suspenseful and keep you on the edge of you seat .
i love the idea of & # 34 ; what if & # 34 ; that 's what this movie is all about and bonus it 's a musical too .
was very disappointed in this movie did not do harrison ford justice and it did not explain enough about why things were being done like they are
this a great movies and being in 3d was even better . i love the action in this movies too . highly recommend this movies to everyone who love the superman series .
this film is great if you are looking for a thriller film to watch . otherwise , you may be disappointed .
the movie is a different take on what a & # 34 ; zombie & # 34 ; is and i loved it . it is full of suspense and mystery .
i really enjoy watching this movie , i laugh a lot and i ca n't wait for the second movie to come out .
even as i enjoyed it 30 years ago , my kids are enjoying it today . also , a lot of good morals taught in this version , unlike many cartoons today .
had forgotten how entertaining this animation is . one liners flying all around and the small scary stuff really mix well for great viewing .
loved the movies , needed to update my collection with dvds ( in place of vhs ) . nice set . fun series of movies .
my boys and i really enjoyed this movie . it did not disappointment me like some sequels do . i look forward to hunger games 3
this was really a deal . this was a short lived series and this is the 2 seasons for a great price . i enjoyed it a lot .
what more can you say ... it is the batman . you ca n't go too far wrong if you have a good story and good animation to back it up . that 's what you will find here .
i really like the premise and the stories and the genre of the series . i never watched it until now . it 's really a terrific show ... ... ... ..
you will want to watch it over and over . holds close to the bible so , you can feel you are learning while being entertained ! ! !
been waiting to get a copy of this for a long time now . it 's all good ! ! ca n't say enough . thanks ! !
would recommend this movie if you are a john travolta fan . it is a tear jerker and he dances in this one too .
great film with bob hope and james cagney . dvd quality is pretty good in this selection from the bob hope film collection . however , it is only presented in a full screen version .
they said it was redford in the film , but who was that man in this film . i 've seen redford in many films before . this was not him . horrible movie .
i loved reading the book , and these stories are just as great , if not better ... what fun ! i highly recommend this series .
i love deniro and i think he 's a fantastic actor . his movies are all very very good !
beautiful romantic movie . good karate action , good entertaining storyline . another movie i can look at over and over again and not get tired of it .
i like the film . it was entertaining to watch . it made me laugh . i recommend this film to all who like to laugh .
john wayne acting like he does any other movie . a great western . has a little love story in it as well .
the 3 stories was good not the scariest but entertaining . i recommend this movie to those who do n't like horror movies .
johnny depp was worth the rental . found his role amusing but not enough `` camp '' to save this movie . watch the original to enjoy the drama and humor .
i have been watching this collection for a while and finally found it at the right price . i am waiting for my mash viewing marathon to begin !
this was better than i expected , tied in to the others quite well . f f f f f f f f
i saw this movie when i was younger . not the best martial arts movie but still fun to watch . found it at a good price so i purchased it .
a childhood favorite and i got a little nostalgic that 's why i purchased this . it is a cute movie .
the program appeared unrealistic . the plot appeared to be very poorly written . a lot of the scenes were contrived and implausible .
this is the greatest movie ever . the standard dvd does n't come with commentary , so this version is worth the extra money .
saw this as a little girl . loved the film them , love it now . so glad to have it . the dvd is in perfect condition . thank you so much . got here in record time .
it is an happy and exciting , funny movie but has a terrible ending that is dark and confusing . not worth the watch , because i am sure there are much better movies of marilyn monroe .
had no idea - must not have read the description that close . but it is quite cute ! showing it in my class since i can not find a french version hope the students like it .
we already had this movie in blu-ray and thought it would be a good one in 3d . it is and worth the difference in price .
i was bored one night and decided to watch the movie , not great but a good way to pass an evening .
best season with so much action . great attention to details . storyline was well thought out and great to follow as well .
the writers really thought a lot of themselves , they were trying to make another `` 10 '' or something . i could n't even get through the first 20 minutes .
really like this show , is refreshing to see that in todays tv shows . watch this show i 'm sure you 'll love it !
i have always enjoyed watching cher movies -- this one was a really good show and i enjoyed watching it again after all this time
this movie is for all people if you have faith or not , it 's a good father hood movie and family movie as will .
great movie . good plot ; costuming very much in keeping with the era . takes you back in time . great for those interested in world war ii events .
i like this movie . you either like it or you do n't , patrick stewart and cast take us on a ride . it was fun !
this is a great movie , i own the first on , so of course i wanted the second one . the buyer is someone i would make a purchase from in the future .
this is one of my favorite anime series of all time . i 'm glad that it was reasonably priced and that i was able to order them all at the same time . : )
this story is so amazing ! everyone has a second chance . we need to believe in others ! love this movie and would recommend it for everyone !
got this for my niece , she is a huge fan of the show . i sat and watched it with her and now i must say i am a fan .
i 've watched both the death bell movies and i favor the first one over this one . this one disappointed me .
love this genre , scream is great . funny and scary at the same time , watch regularly .
this is a good western movie to watch . this is a family movie no sex and understanding of how life of three women from the east were treated and one woman 's life changed .
i bought this for my girlfriend because it brought back childhood memories . the movie is a great watch and comical . definitely worth it .
one of my all-time favorites . i love all of harrison ford 's movies . the price was great , fast shipping , love it , thank you .
my husband and i enjoyed the movie very much , the movie arrived on time just as they said it would .
i and the family really enjoyed the movie . very touching and good to find something not filled with foul words .
this has always been my favorite of the pink panther movies . there was no one like peter sellers , he was the best ! !
the best yet ; sad to see one of the main characters killed in a car accident any chance he will come out of this alive remains to be seen
loved it , a great mix of humor and heartwarming scenes . i wish i had watched this one before despicable me 2 , but they were both great .
this movie is different for sure but lots of action , , , i do n't know about you but i am into this kind of movies
i purchased this for my nephews birthday . he loves old cartoons just like me and my brother watched when we were little . this is a great example of old cartoons my nephew loves it .
i love watching audie murphy . the westerns that audie murphy made are the ones that i like the best from his collection .
so amazingly funny - great pair up and chemistry with bullock and mccarthy and i really , really , really , hope they do more stuff together - one of the best movies i 've seen in a long time
i wore the tapes of these movies out . i was so glad to see that the dvd collection was available . i would recommend this collection to anyone who enjoys the classic horror movies from the 50s .
first time i watched this movie i did n't realize where this movie was going until the very end . good movie .
why did i buy this ? neither me , my daughter or girlfriend liked this . after the only one scene my grandaughter liked `` where is mickey ? ''
see the original marilyn ! this is a great old show ! very silly . black & white ! i love these older shows . this is great to watch with the whole family ! another must have !
season 2 gets even more in depth & involved in king henry 's life . you start to understand how the king thinks .
saw it when i was a teenager and enjoyed it then ; now i have the dvd and can enjoy it and introduced it to my grandchildren who are teens .
very touching heartfelt movie about love of family when facing the most horrible situation that any of us could ever imagine . this movie is a gem and a must see for anyone
sometimes these episodes seem to last longer than an hour , but they definitely draw you in . several twists in this season that i did n't see coming , so you 've been warned !
i was really surprised just how good this movie was . action , and a little bit of comedy . it is worth watching .
`` when theres no more room in hell , the dead will walk the earth '' that gets 5 stars alone , this will make a great gift or even an addition to a collection .
i love robert redford . he has so much charm . this is a fun movie to be enjoyed over and over .
the first time i watched this movie i thought it was hilarious , so when i saw it i had to get it .
very good movie lots of good acting and great horror at its best . you will want to see this movie
i have always enjoyed this movie and i finally added it to my collection ! great cast and performance ! creepy and scary ! ! : )
this was a fun film and i really enjoyed it . thank you for making it available for purchase . enjoy watching it .
i got this dvd for my children for halloween . 5 yrs old and 7 yrs old and they both love it . we have watched it a lot during october . i am glad i purchased it .
not as good as the orginal , but plenty of action . the romantic story got in the way of the plot in this one but not so much that you could n't enjoy it .
lets get the rest of the series out there for us to enjoy before we get too old to enjoy . and what happened with the rest of happy days ?
watched it was n't that impressed . i have seen better but it was good for an afternoon with popcorn and company .
loved this movie a long time ago . it is a bit dated now , but still worth watching . glad i got it .
not really a good movie for young children . the makeup was great but , i think , too scary for youngsters . the story was where you want to cheer on the young main character ... yay !
each cartoon just gets better and better i love everyone of these movies and i hope they never stop making these classics .
this dvd is in great condition when i received it and the picture and sound quality is excellent for an old charlie chan movie .
excellent scifi movie for the whole family ! absolutely fun to watch with kids . the story on the human side is a little weak but everything else is good .
cheesy . bad graphics which is fine if your story is good enough . but ... it 's not . nor are the actors really great . have it an honest chance but just could n't get into it .
this was a movie for our 12 year old . it was a great film which we viewed together and she requested having her own copy for christmas . she loves it .
not very funny . long . would n't recommend it . fun cast of actors but the movie was n't very funny . not one i would rewatch
love brad pitt and love westerns . great movie showing how it really was . it 's a piece of history that shows the real side of the cowboy heroes
i love kathy . i love her tv show and i have seen her live . this dvd delivers and does she . that is all you need to know .
dvd itself was brand new . i 'd just forgotten the movie was n't as good as i thought . was more interesting 40 years ago !
a western with sam elliott , it ca n't possible be bad . actually , my husband and i both enjoyed this movie and it had some surprises in it .
she a special person who i look up to she make me laugh with they way she acts i like the way she take action madea is one cool woman
this is well worth buying for a mash fan ! ! we have all the seasons on dvd and love them .
definitely worth the money ! a quality dvd classic ! one of my favourite movies . gregory peck was always great ! i would recommend it .
what can i say about this movie ? absolutely a good movie . i would recommend this movie . a must see movie .
why bother making a sequal movie like this . disney should never made a update movie after wizard of oz .
awesome movie . i have the saga and i will treasure this edition as all of my other ones ! thank you so very much .
the movie arrived in awesome shape and very fast ! very pleased with the product and the timing ! the movie is funny and plays perfectly clear !
acting was better than a lot of movies i have seen recently . story was good . i felt involved in the story and its got lincoln killing vampires . what more can u want from a movie
my daughters first real movie - she loved it . i do n't really need to write another great review - there are a ton already .
the blu-ray version is awesome , combined with the one of the greatest dancing musicals of all time makes it more awesome .
this is a great newer movie . the old guys win again ! great actors . good plot . bruce gets the girl again !
i watched 3 shows but was bored . the lead actress was annoying and while the writing was good , this show did nothing for me . i may need to watch it again .
i have enjoyed what i have seen of it , but my husband has really enjoyed the lone ranger series . a great product for lone ranger fans .
the performances were wonderful it was like you were in the audience and they kept you entertained through the whole disc
football fighting good storyline got ta see this one , well worth it . a violent ballet of great acting well made fighting scenes
bought this for my son for christmas . he really loves the friends season . and it is a good gift to share with the whole family too
i love all these thrillers , these are classics and must see . the acting and the story line is top quality .
i ca n't wait for the next episode of the show each time that i watch one . very high quality and i love it !
watching this a 2nd time around does n't make it any less wonderful . this is and always will be a classic .
love this movie . it 's been so long since i seen it . so i enjoy it so much . would recommend it to anyone who love lifetime movies . would order from this seller again .
it my favorite movie watch it more than 100 times when i was little i really love it ! i got it on time !
just bought a blue ray dvd player . loved the movie `` cars '' and wanted to see it in its best quality . was well worth the purchase . color and intensity of graphics are so much better
this is a cute , funny , clean movie with a nice message . the acting is great . it gives a little insight into the college scene . relax , and enjoy this one !
we usually love just about anything with steve martin in it , and we were n't disappointed with this movie either . it 's both funny and sentimental . we love it !
this is essential to the rest of the series . you need to watch it to learn what happened to the characters later in their lives .
it was okay . i thought it was going to have more action but it was quite slow in places . acting was good and had a good story line .
i really enjoyed this film . it is n't the best film ever made , but was great for a friday night in .
it was a great movie . the acting was great and the story was exciting . i would recommend this action movie .
people , i 'm sure i speak for everyone when i say this is an all time classic . the people who made this on dvd should know that !
well , l we have all the previous seasons on dvd . we just love the show and this season is as good as the previous six .
this is a masterpiece . it 's as simple as that . it 's albert brooks ' very best film . no film fan should miss it .
this movie is just fun . lopez is great . i never was a fonda fan but she was good too . liked this movie a lot .
it 's a pretty good film -- mainly because of johnny depp . a few holes in the plot , a few predictable moments , but overall entertaining .
just made you feel good in the christmas spirit . the product was in great shape and the service was awesome .
i am giving this movie three stars . i thought it was a great movie and had a good story line !
rarely a remake of a previous movie is worth watching . this was creative and entertaining . a good rainy day movie .
i saw on the internet , i enjoyed it . so i look for this dvd and i brought it . the story is good and enjoyed it .
the second series is also good and worth watching the development of the characters . the main leads are growing and it is not as expected .
i , myself did not like the movie . looked at it once , and put it away . i know more people will find it to their liking , but not i .
i finally got the out of print godzilla dvd took forever for it to drop down on the damn price range !
no matter what dean martin does his great . wish i could get all of his shows and movies and his music .
a relatively light hearted movie that was an enjoyable view without having to struggle with the plot . old but good .
this movie to me does n't have the action of the original king kong but if u like the original film then this is good to have for your collection
i wanted to add this movie to my dvd library and of course , i love the movie . i always enjoyed the tv series and this is just plain fun to watch .
as usual , when ever a critic says that something is bad , it usually turns out not to be that way .
i chose this because it looked interesting and it was , i liked the story , the way the animals talked and worked together . i would recommend it to anyone .
it was received timely , and in new condition as advertised , however , i did n't care for the movie - i found it to be very depressing .
great product exactly as described ! ! gave as a gift he loved the movie and excellent quality as well ! he said the movie was awesome
john wayne is my all time favorite actor . this series is some of his best work . i would be happy to recommend this to anyone .
ok storyline . not suspenseful . i kept waiting for the suspense but none happened . almost could be funny but was n't . if you have nothing else to watch .
this copy played beautifully and i like stargate and i wanted a better playing copy than the dvd i had . so , i gave that copy to my son . recommend this if you like science fiction .
i liked the story and the special effects like realistic dinosaurs . i like the idea of time travel on earth .
it was very good . kind of slow paced and lots of good jokes but do n't expect a lot of action . not that kind of movie
this is an amazing true story , beautifully told , good acting . i have it on vhs tape , and was so grateful to now have it on dvd so i can watch it .
i enjoyed every episode and hated when it was over . aaron paul is adorable . i would like to see more series like that one .
omg this movie will keep your attention through the entire movie i mean all the way up until the credits roll .
great story line , easy to follow . sandra bullock is one of the best actresses , and i watch all of her movies .
we love watching this show on tv and had to get the first two seasons for our house to watch whenever we want too ! : )
we 've ordered several tv series , and this is one of the best , we have really enjoyed it and only hate it ended without there being more series . was worth it . thank you
this is a movie that makes you almost laugh all the time . there is no profanity or bad pictures . go buy it today .
hey there all . just want to let you all know that this is a great deal . go for it . later .
looked for this at an affordable price for a few years - great classic movie . i ca n't stay interested enough to read the books , so this works very well for me .
very well done . seen it before . dicaprio does a great job as a soldier in africa . four more words ok .
my daughter absolutely loved this movie ! she would probably watch it every day if i 'd let her . definitely worth the purchase !
it was another kinda cheesy movies but i did enjoy it very much it at least had a plot to it
i watched this movie before going to see the movie with the same actress in it . i decided not to see it even though i really like sandra bullock . just too much .
i love this movie ! the look of the movie is what should be expected for an older movie , just a little more vibrant . no extras , just the movie .
awesome dvd ! arrived in excellent condition and was very fast and so worth it ! i am very pleased and would give you ten stars if i could ! thank you ! : )
my daughter & i started watching grey 's from the beginning - still loving it ! now ... looking forward to season 10 dvd set : ) !
i love this movie . it takes me back to more innocent years as a teenager . sometimes it nice to let the present go .
she loves the series . i could take it or leave it , but if it makes the wife happy . as the saying goes & # 34 ; happy wife , happy life & # 34 ; .
i absolutely loved this show , and i am so glad i can watch dvd 's since the show was cancelled . i have the first 3 seasons , and love all of them ! !
give it a chance and watch it please i dont give good reviews but give it a chance ok please
one of my new favorite shows i like to watch with my husband so buying it on dvd was definitely a must .
though i did n't love this final season i do love the show . four stars , three if their would have been following seasons .
pbs stopped right after the baby was born . went back to season one . i was really happy to be able to see the rest rather than wait to see if pbs would finally get to it .
this is one of my favorite tom hanks movies . it is very funny . a very good movie .
this was one of my favorite series and i am now able to rewatch it as many times as i wish to .
i love the office ! if you have n't watched the series , i highly recommend that you do ! one of the funniest tv shows that i have ever watched !
fun for all ages . this movie brings christmas up to modern day technology . it is heart warming and has a great ending . great family flick .
this is the third time i have told you that i was unable to watch this video . region free dvd player did not work .
my kids love the super hero movies and this did not disappoint . it was a christmas day hit . i got it for a great price too .
still a very good movie , but it 's better on the actual stage . but save your money and see this version instead . it 's still pretty good .
i bought this movie for my sister and have n't watched it myself yet . i do n't know if i would recommend this movie or not .
wonderfull dvd . raymond burr is wonderfull as perry mason . a must have for that perry mason person in you . enjoy .
you have to write too much . i did not personally watch this dvd but my daughter did and she loves it .
i thought this had the potential to be a great movie but i found it to be just ok .
this was a wonderful movie and very well done i must said i love this kinda movie with all my heart . you better watch it soon
this is as good as the rest . as with all the x men movies this is a good one . lots of action with humor mixed in . the whole family enjoyed it . great to watch .
again , i 'd watch anything elvis did . a decent actor and absolutely a gorgeous young man . gone but not forgotten . sad .
a very fun movie . this is the kind of movie you can not think to much about , you just have to set back and enjoy it .
if you are a billy crystal fan , you will love this movie . i think it is one of his best .
excellent movie , and i now see why it has lasted over so many years . i enjoyed the movie and it had a good story line and plot to it .
i truly enjoyed this movie and it was money well spent . this movie shows what is going to happen in the end times which i believe we are here !
this series is action packed . it tries to bring to life what it was really like , but like i stated before 4 guys could never beat 100 guys .
i really liked the origin , so when trying to bring back memories of the past it kind of seemed lacking . i wish it would have been more of a remake of the original .
i 've always enjoyed 24 and sutherland . this one is especially good . i would recommend it to anyone that likes action .
neil diamond at his best , captured for my personal enjoyment . i may have to buy more for my family and friends .
i 'm not a big hugh jackman fan but this is a great story . well written , well acted , nicely balanced , and has a positive ending - sort of ...
i did n't even finish watching this . it could not hold my interest at all . would not recommend it to anyone .
only put 4 stars just because my son did n't seem as into it as i though he would . very good learning dvd for kids . great price ! fast delivery
we had seen this movie in the theatre , and when we shared it with friends whom had n't seen it before , we all enjoyed it as a group .
another good movie from steven seagal . i 've watched this one several times , too , and am still liking it very much .
this is just a really good watch . not the best , but fun around christmas time . definitely a keeper you 'll enjoy for a long time .
suspend your sense of reality . good action and i liked the actors . i would recommend it to anyone who enjoys fantasy and a happy ending .
top 10 sports movies all-time . there are several messages in the film ... wrapped around a baseball theme . it 's a must watch .
this was a good family movie that we rented from amazon . it was n't extraordinary , but i was happy to not worry about curse words .
i am so pleased with the purchase of the 4th season of father knows best . this is what i consider quality television viewing . ca n't wait to own the entire series .
a fun and unique movie . seems to want to be like the princess bride . not as good as that , with more adult themes . still a good movie though
another 1 off the list . trying to get all the disney movies as soon as they are released on blu ray
i have always liked veggie tales from when they first came out . i love that they have all of the different stories for kids to learn things in an easy to understand way .
this movie is a cult classic . if you you like brutal fight oriented animation this is the movie that set the bar .
i rated it this high because the description of the product was right on the money . i appeared to be band new .
i love the old spongebob . i have this vhs tape . it is good one , has lots of the classic episodes . better than the spongebob today , the new one stinks .
fascinating story based on true events over several decades and how their lives connect . excellent acting by the 4 main stars .
i will be honest i like this because the nudity . this is not for kids . this movie is about a boy about 18 and his friends .
saw this movie on tv in the 70s and remembered today how much i enjoyed it back then . the dvd did not let me down . was delivered in a timely manner and in great shape .
this was the beginning of all that is wonderful in the ncis world . love to be able to watch it from the start .
fast action . was as good as the first taken movie . sometimes second movie is not as good as first . this one was
i wanted it to be longer of course , but this gave a person with a limited knowledge of the series a good idea of some of the action and suspense involved .
i enjoyed this as a child and was excited to get it for my daughter . she enjoys the movie as well and loves to dance and sing along .
this film is absolutely hilarious for reasons too numerous to list . i ca n't remember a time when i laughed so hard ! don knotts rocks ! ! !
i got this and love it . now getting them all for my halloween collection . nice having a family series for the holidays . this fits the bill .
excellent movie so much going on you have to watch it several times to see everything . i have the set and it is fun to watch them all in a day
the classic films included in this collection are wholesome and worthwhile for every member of the family . we have thoroughly enjoyed watching and re-watching each of them ...
this has been beautifully restored and the blu ray version is so clear . this is a must have for christmas .
a great classic ! it could not be better ! this is something you should have in your dvd collection ! excellent !
i ca n't say enough great things about this show ! this is acting and writing at its very best . this season is a knock out and reminded me why i love this show .
you ca n't go wrong with this flick , just sit back and enjoy . there are just a lot of talented people here doing everything right ,
its funny . i think all of these comedians was on the old comic view shows .
great movies , my grandkids love them and all are good story lines . i have enjoyed watching them as well . the movies are old ones but the message is good .
excellent movie ! very moving and powerful . i have n't read the book but after watching the movie i definitely want to .
i like this show . it was entertaining and a bit different than most lawyer shows i have watched . so far so good .
this is a touching movie that shows what teaching is all about ! there will be all types of emotions from sadness to laughter ! excellent movie !
one of my favorites . just what i needed . arrived right on time . a must have . a great buy at a great price . 2 thumbs up .
i always enjoyed any movie about outer space . this one was very interesting & had beautiful scene 's . even the very beginning with the apes .
this movie was a disappointment really . i thought it would be alot better but it was okay .
not what i expected . was very disappointed . thought this was a cute cartoon about the peanuts gang . would not recommend to anyone !
ugh . great stars but how wrong they turned ... with a poor director . acting is weird and stiff and i just did n't get the `` plot '' ... very confusing .
great actors , acting , and writing . not like your everyday , ordinary cop shows . nothing like usual cop shows shows that are on tv .
i enjoyed watching perry mason when i was little , and on reruns when i got older . always a good show .
yeah , i really like this film . definitely a must see if you are a fan of science fiction . bruce willis is also one of my favorite actors . buy it now ! ! !
scary in it 's own way because it 's happening right now ! great movie ! we are being watched , get used to it .
given that the movie is based on real life events , it was enjoyable . it was suspenseful when it needed to be , and a good mix of drama and comedy ( ok , dry comedy ) .
i loved all the characters in this movie and chose this rating because no matter what , i love christmas movies . some more than others . those i loved more than others i bought !
while not following the comics much at all , this take on the first group of x-men was very good . i 'm really looking forward to the next installment in the series .
it was worth waiting for . the blu-ray is the definitive edition of this beloved family classic that many of us first saw when we were children .
i love tyler and this sitcom is one of his best especially mr. brown . this is hilarious and also with a great storylines
did not get to see it , i had to buy it for the library for a replacement of 1 that was stolen !
under rated band except by those who followed them back in the day . this is said to be their best live concert dvd . i got this as a gift .
loved this movie as a kid and enjoyed it just as much watching with my god daughter ! def . a classic !
this movie was amazing ! the fear of space is brought to life as we follow sandra bullock on her journey to get back home .
we love watching these movies . alice is one of our favorite characters . we own them all . very good movies , if you like that sort .
i would definetly consider watching frozen . its a cute stories with lots of lovable characters and a great soundtrack . its a feel good family movie .
this thing is in search of more than a director ; it needs a story line . an ending would help too .
this is an excellent series . we thoroughly enjoy watching each episode . we ca n't wait for each new season to become available .
this was not my kind of movie . you would have to see for yourself . i can or ca n't recommend it right now . maybe l have to view it again .
i did n't really care for the movie would not watch again . [ bought because of the reviews . i like true stories . maybe it was n't my taste
we were unable to see this when it originally showed at the theatre , but we are glad we bought the dvd . we really enjoyed the whole movie , and were pleased with the service we received .
this is nothing like the board game i grew up with but it was still good sci fi action movie
that the movie was sexy and weird . the make up jobs are great . the acting and special effects could be better
my daughter read the book she said it was alot better . brought this for christmas she saw the movie was alittle dissapointed
i always enjoy a good thriller that gives us an option to those awful comedy shows on tv these days !
we love harry potter here . this is another great movie in the series . as almost always the case , the book is better , but the movie is still well worth watching .
this is a great science fiction movie that you will love to watch with your friends . will keep you in your seat .
this is just act ii of the play . it is ok because of the stars but is is not as good as the first
john cusack is so adorable and sweet and i love kate 's accent . very cute story and good romance movie . chick flick , of course , but you still got ta love it .
the actors are top notch and the story was great . lots of action and thrills . a great movie for movie night .
i grew up watching the old batman tv series and reading the comic books , so i love batman . this movie is actually pretty good .
one of the best zombie movies i have seen in a while . good story line , good acting and lots of suspense to keep your attention to the screen .
the book arrived in the time frame given and was a great read . i love comedies and this movie was hilarious . i read the book and think the movie was worth the buy .
i just love this movie . it 's sweet , a little sad and has all the drama needed to make it a good movie .
do n't remember getting it -- must have been a gift - sorry i did n't let you know something sooner - thanks
being a lover of old films & stars i collect them on dvd when the price is right to add to my collection .
i absolutely loved this movie . bought a copy of it too . the cgi is breath taking and the story powerful . ca n't wait for the follow-up .
one of his best shows it is funny and series and very interesting to see how it will end then you are ready to watch it again ...
this collections gets you into the holiday spirit . we watch them every year and it never seems to get old .
surprisingly , a pretty good flick . low budget , but filmed very well - and the story line is pretty creative ! definately worth a watch .
good science fiction , but not really an original enough story ... visual effects are worth seeing , more originality and depth please .
fun movie . terrible premise , but if you are into movies with decent action and great visuals it is worth checking out . in hd .
i am so happy to have this on dvd . our family would sit together and watch this movie when we wanted to laugh . great cast .
i actually purchased this to give a friend . so i can not tell you anything about it . but i do n't think they would have requested without hearing good things about it ! ! !
i was skeptical about renting this , i am not a huge dwayne johnson fan . but i was pleasantly surprised ! i actually ended up buying it on blu-ray
the doctor is back , and he 's saving the world again ! well worth watching over and over again ! great sci-fi adventure !
this is the one of the best madea movies i 've seen . tyler perry makes this character funny , outrageous , but still holds her character together .
a movie i will watch again and again . it is a love story that is very sad yet probably with a lot of truth .
i did not like this movie at all . sorry for the writer ( s ) . not worth your money . no no
my child watched these at school sometimes and was in love with them . so we got it for home so everyone could watch it . it 's a decent kids ' movie .
takes me back to when things were simpler and my kids were little ! great fun , beautiful costumes , cute story lines .
i would n't say that this is the best sequel to a movie but it was still really good . great action scenes and glad to see that most of the original cast is back for the second movie .
my children wanted this for christmas so i ordered out a few and made everyone happy .
a movie you will want to share with your kids over and over , this movie is a must have for any family .
i ordered for a friend -- she wanted it for her grandson . her grandson is very happy with it and has watched it more then once ! !
the dvd was clear . i enjoyed this movie because of the historical view point of view . also the movie was very entertaining .
of course the original was a great movie ! this one is ok. not great , not horrible . it was worth watching once . i can watch original several times .
the dvd arrived promptly and was just what i expected ! it is a classic christmas movie and a must for my collection !
the movie was great . there was scenes in the movie i never seen on any of the movie channels or on tv . i enjoy the major league movies .
we watched this movie because the 2nd one is being released soon and wanted to see this first . overall , the movie is pretty good .
liked the first season of this show so watched the second season on at a time . this third season is more of the same good characters and interesting plot lines .
i enjoyed the audio only version of this performance better . still funny but it 's not a dvd i would own .
i can recall watching this film on tv . it was entertains and well made .
was an ok tv movie i guess could have been much more a little predictable too ...
for me this is like a new classic film . i was skeptical about the cast but i left the theater impressed and wanting to watch it again and again .
shows you alot about walmart , some things you could never imagine , and what happens to keep the prices so low ...
it is one of the best action movie of this era . i would recommend . matt is a superb actor , who gave the movie class .
my best george clooney movie , warm , funny , a subject that many of us unfortunately can relate to . would recommend this film to friends and family .
brings me back to the 70 's watching this series . some of the acting was a little hokey but overall i enjoyed it thoroughly .
this was one of my favorite movies of last year and the kids could not wait for it to come out on blue ray .
i like having a copy of this to go back to and watch every now and then . it 's such a great movie .
my wife love 's this series and this one is no exception . quality , clean , and a great message . highly recommended for family viewing .
lots of violence as you would expect from a 007 movie . good thriller . not for the faint of heart or easily upset by all the violence .
this a wonderful dvd to add to any dvd collection . if you like heart warming movies , this is one i would highly recommend you buy .
the best scary movie i 've seen in a long time . great story line , great actors , great ending . will definitely watch again
excellent wrap up of the earlier star wars movies . while the ending will surprise no one , it is well done . could there be more ? ? ? ?
we really enjoyed watching this movie . it was a lot of fun . my husband did n't like the first one , but he had fun at this one .
rather ordinary , a bit long and drawn out ... found it did not hold my interest . would n't rave about it to others at all .
loved this movie ! they are both really funny in different ways but she is a riot ! the previews do n't do it justice . hilarious
i love this movie . i can watch this one over and over again . this will always be in my collection !
brad pitt . need i say more ? i do n't remember the whole movie by heart because i 've only seen it once .
loved the music , dancing , so many stars ! highly recommend for those who love classic film musicals featuring so much talent .
one of those rare movies with great acting and a great script ! i do n't buy many movies but will buy this one . note , this movies is n't for everyone and some will say it sucked !
i enjoy this company and the dvds they produce . i have several and i have yet to be disappointed . worth the price too !
shipping was quick ! i received this days before i thought i would . these are my favorite movies and i am thrilled to now own them and can watch whenever i want .
disappointing , but i did n't know the story before seeing this , not my thing as it is too sad for me , too dark
good story , very predictable but i like that . good acting . i prefer these old movies to the things they make these days . black and white does n't bother me
this is one of my favorite series . it is well written and all of the actors give an excellent performance .
i 'm amazed how this is still powerful today , as in the beginning . hope they would make this full screen also , like when it first came out .
i liked the fact that the horse tells the story . the cinematography was stunning . this movie would be suitable for young children .
great movie , good message . it 's got a great cast too . perfect for your kids . i really enjoyed it . you will too .
a documentary mixed in with the concert footage . i would have rated this concert dvd higher if the documentary footage was n't mixed in with the concert footage .
we just recently bought this movie and like all of the barney shows and movies we were n't disappointed . its all just good clean fun
love this movie . got tired of waiting for it to be available at the library . had to have my own copy .
good piece of history . wish there were more than 60 minutes to the video . very educational and poignant . everyone interested in music should watch it .
i loved this show when it ran on tv and was thrilled to find it at such a great price . was very pleased with delivery time and condition . would order from again .
love the characters and the story . those old movies are the best . sherlock and watson , those actors really know their stuff
not a good movie to watch , and it gets old quick and i think the rewatch value is low . the storyline is n't believable either .
this was an incredible performance by matthew mcconaughey ! he certainly earned the best actor oscar ! the subject is tough and the movie is tough to watch sometimes , but definitely worth seeing .
it was a good wholesome movie to watch . both me and my husband like it . would recommend seeing it if you get the chance .
the movie has a lot of violence but so does our history . the cast was good , the story was easy to follow but beware it is very graphic . classic movie for younger generation .
though a few are older , their message and meaning are still powerful and will help bring the christmas spirit into your home .
love this movie . audrey hepburn is just fantastic . they just do n't make great films like this anymore ! ! would highly recommend .
this is a wonderful dvd . the story is very interesting and compelling . and it is filmed in such beautiful areas . it a great film .
this is a very dramatic movie , and the acting is great . i shows the dark side of our human race and what it is like to lose your freedom .
i enjoyed this fresh way of looking at holmes in an action packed film . the turns and twists keeps your mind trying to figure out the who done it !
great cast , is something to watch for me on a rainy day . if you love westerns this one of the classic 's .
dancing and family issues , i thought it could have been much better did n't seem to give good movement through out the movie , jumped around a lot .
great movie . can watch it again and again and still cry at the end .
its good 3 disk to watch . i found the scenes to be alright . i found the acting is good but the way the scenes are needed help .
not what u think it will be it is a surprise movie i was really impressed when it turned out like it did
i loved this show and the main character . so happy to be able to watch it whenever i wish .
an interesting story , and well done , but i do n't like the morals portrayed . i suppose it could be considered a lesson in the way not to live .
i was very pleased with the speed at which i received my movie . it was in perfect condition when i received it . i would definitely order from them again . thank you .
this movie is fun for the family . it 's one of my favorites , it came to me quickly and in perfect condition . i have watched it several times with my children since .
i enjoyed this movie because i 'm a history buff . it more than met my expectations and i have watched it several times .
you know some of these low budget movies are alot better than the high budget movies this one was pretty good i 'd see it again . not a bad movie at all .
this movie was awesome . constant nonstop action . very good ! ! rented it , loved it and had to have it for my collection . could watch it over and over again .
i really wanted to like this movie , but i could n't . the premise was interesting , but that 's about where it ended . do n't waste your time or money on this dud .
i thought it was an excellent story . there were a few times that i could n't follow what was going on . hard to hear .
we both love this series . the episodes are all good and we love the characters . we do n't want it to end .
this set was a gift for my wife who has always loves the story . she seems satisfied with this box set .
i had such hopes for this movie . it wasnt horrible , but they took a lot of the charm that made the animated series so much fun to watch . it also seemed rushed .
great movie and a great cheap price too . buy this blu-ray cause i really cant see the difference from this one and the latest release , fast delivery
so much fun jason statham always plays a great action roll keeps you on the the edge of your seat
again i love this series and would recommend it to anyone & everyone . it 's worth it 's weight in gold . ca n't wait for season 4 to come out .
foyle 's war is well written . there are always more than one thing going on in the story . the characters develop with each episode .
this is a great series and i 'm glad to be able to add this to the rest of my seasons collection . great acting , story lines , and surprises . excellent ! ! !
awesome series that now can get all seven years and revisit and rewatch when nothing else on . great to see it on dvd .
awesome movie ! one of my all time favorites . i watch it a few times a year just because it makes me laugh .
it was a surprise for my son 's birthday and he loved it ! we watched this as soon as it came .
bought this for my wife , and she is a big tom fan , so she just had to have this movie . a great hit
great film the song title will have you in tears as for the film well great story and another one for your collection .a must brian
i should have rented it first and then decide to buy later but i really did not care the story behind the title . great condition and fast service . if you buy this rent it first .
each episode keeps you coming back for more . full of everything from suspense to disaster on daily basis . whats next ?
pretty poor movie . not sure what the point of the movie really was . i kept thinking that it would get better but it sure did n't .
if you want a show that has bad acting , decent plot , and not a lot of sex , this is it . worth watching one time maybe .
got to say this is great ! makes ya wonder if it could actually happen ! another one ya can see more than once !
i saw some of those matches on different dvds and but i was glad to get this one because you do n't see these any more on tv .
great movie ! lots of unexpected twists and turns ! will definitely keep you on the edge of your seat ! excellent plot !
would love to see more documentaries like this one . can you suggest any ? how about wives and families struggles during world war ii
for a movie that was done in 1950 it is wonderful . the story line seems a little trite . but the dancing is superb .
my wife and i watched it . i thought it was going to be more funny . overall , i do n't recommend watching it .
arrived quickly and in great condition . mountain played their hits and some newer stuff as well but it was all good . i would recommend this concert .
great movie ! fun , funny and sad but enjoyed so much had to watch again . really funny movie ! you 'll enjoy it
this is a first for me , i did n't like this movie and i think i only had it on for about 20 minutes . acting just was n't there .
i really look forward to watching this series . plenty of mystery , action , and adventure along with great personalities in the series characters .
it was really in good condition . the only thing i would have to say is that it was a little worn on the side . other than that it was in good condition .
my son loved some of these movies that we watched on sunday night when i was growing up . good collection
still one of the best ! i ca n't tell you how many people were surprised by the ending . watching it again , it 's still as good as the first time i saw it with my wife .
arrived very fast and in good condition . ca n't ask for more . during the xmas rush some things get lost but i was happy to see this in my mail box .
not one dull moment in this film , douglas is a master actor , the story is both funny and tragic and you will never be able to stop watching it until it 's over .
top notch martial arts with more than perfect special effects . great film to watch . bad guys lose good guys win in the end . perfect western world copy cat .
i love this series and enjoy watching it over and over . i would highly recommend it to anyone that is looking for a good wholesome show .
i absolutely love these movies . the best part is that you get new movies cheaper on here than anywhere else .
so happy this is on prime . loving this series for years and this is one of the really great seasons .

truly wonderful writing and acting as well as sets - fun for all ages - my husband and i sit and watch with our 13 year old and we all ca n't wait to see veronica every week .
these movies are a great addition to my dvd collection . if you 're a fan of chuck norris , then i do n't have to tell you anymore about these . get 'em .
this is a very cute movie , mainly for kids . i did like it and recommend it if you have children .
the message of this movie is a+ . the acting however leaves a lot to be desired . i have not watched it very often .
we have watched all of the death race movies and none of them have let us down ! most sequels get pretty lame after the first two but not death race !
i loved this movie . non stop action . got it in blu-ray because i wanted better picture and sound and it does n't disappoint .
great movie with a very good plot and life lesson . worth renting , or owning for that matter . a movie you can even watch in front of the kids , which is harder to find these days .
what fun memories to see these shows again ! i was surprised at how many details i remember . future stars guest appear in many episodes . there 's even a young brad pitt . i recommend this item .
i love this movie and think it is a very nice family movie . i am not sorry i purchased it ... ... ... .very happy i added this movie to my collection .
the story is still fresh and romantic , the music very beautiful . it 's just incredible how one can see and experience musicals that are some 60 years old and still be touched by them .

when i was young i saw ed robinson movies i liked much better . i did n't like it all that much .
i loved this movie so much i bought several others from the same producer and found them great as well . i highly recommend this movie .
it the biggest waste of money only a couple movies the rest i do n't know what they were called at time time
not a great story or movie , but a lot of pleasing visuals and scenery i would not recommend if you are tired , you will fall asleep . .
thank you very much for a great movie at a great price . i am very happy with my purchase . i have rated this at a definite 5 star .
i 'm loving these dvds . i waited a long time to be able to afford them but it was well worth the wait and cost .
john wayne always means an excellent movie . do enjoy watching the john wayne movies thru amazon prime , as they are clear and easy to hear .
these movies are unrealistic but interesting . the story line was okay , actors for their time were good and kept in suspense . i recommend these movies .
this 'll scare you ( maybe ) -- anyway , the story will make you think ... richard gere is good and the acting is super ... loved it ! ... worth the $
i 've never read the books , and had no expectations going into this movie . all in all , it was pretty good . i thought it was intriguing and entertaining . i 'd watch it again .
this is a great movie , saw it at the theater and could not wait to get it on dvd . this is my go to movie when i had a bad day .
i 'm happy that they came out with volume 3 this show was a classic in the early 90 's for kids .
this movie is n't worth watching and the only reason i purchased it was because i was an extra in it .
great dvd and info about survival . i recommend people to get & # 34 ; a boy and his dog & # 34 ; . worth what i paid

this dvd set is just like season one great , i recommend it also . the story lines are so funny , buy it and enjoy a blast from the past
this is a very english mystery show . mostly set in college life . can be a bit slow but lots of twists and turns .
this is a real bargain . any one of the movies would be worth the price . i have gotten several different sets of this tcm series and they are worth checking out .
this is a great series as i brought vol 2 as wall and loved them both i remember them as a kid .
just a really good old standard movie . it is good for children to learn a little bit about history when they watch a movie or read a book and this does that .
i love this movie it is one of my all time favorite movies . the first time i watched i loved it
this is a classic film that my kids watch almost daily . this hd version give a nice crisp , rich colorful version that adds to the viewing pleasure . worth the price
what can you say about this series its retro and wonderful and everything i remembered a must have for collectors
the plot was a little weak , but the ending was outstanding . i liked the cast . dvd picture is good but sound could be better .
this was a birthday present for my mother and she loved it . she needed this to complete her walker collection .
very good cop drama , enjoyed the first season more . the second season seems to drag on and on about the shipping industry
i find the show very unique for anime . this makes it interesting to watch . i like it very much and can not wait to finish the series .
want to see the best series made about the 2nd world war ? want to know how a documentary series should be made ? and the narration ! essential viewing for all generations . brilliantly made .
for 2 hours , absolutely nothing happens , nothing . then the movie ends . this is absolutely one of the most boring movies i have ever seen , and i 've seen some boring movies .
easy to watch . not annoying . sweet stories of friendship and helping and fun . too many words needed needed needed needed .
enemy of the state is very suspenseful . my husband & i really enjoyed watching it . we also like the actors in the movie .
great movie , johnny depp is outstanding as always in this movie , these movies were definitely written for him , i now have all four again , they were among the ones stolen from my collection .
doris day is one of my favorites . i have almost everything she 's done . this is truly a comical movie . has some music with singing as well . very family appropriate .
i so enjoyed season 1 and was looking forward to season 2. i still like all the characters but there is too much sex being shown . i am old fashioned and i will not follow this any longer
quality ensemble acting meets engaging script in this gritty story of crime on the streets . plot twists at a quick pace keeps you glued to the seat .
as with all tyler perry movies this did not disappoint . you will laugh from beginning to end . just buy it because you will watch it again .
the series start is decent . do n't expect it to follow old story lines and you wo n't be disappointed . a pretty good buy for any marvel or just x-men fan .
this was such a wonderful series . i hated to come to the end of these dvd 's and will never understand why the show was cancelled after such a short time .
it 's so wonderful to share such inspiring movies with my grandchildren ! no worry about content , language , or dress . just enjoyment !
its great for all ages it 's funny watching the kids try to get their parents back together & they are so bad at it . sometimes , nature needs a hand .
i love this movie . it 's a great family movie . it 's cute and entertaining . you must watch this movie . you will love it ! ! ! : )
great movie great acting must see i recommend it to everyone it was one the best movies of that year
watched this as a kid . loved it then so wanted to see it again and could n't find in the stores .
i never get enough jane austen and this movie was a must purchase for me . i love the book club idea and should be in one .
we are loving it we watch several time a week , and never get tired of watching it , we will never get tired of watching jimmy stewart movies .
i liked this movie except not for the kids due to sex scene in the beginning . good acting . a feel good movie .
i love christmas movies and this one has a god story that you should always believe and take care of family
i really enjoyed this series , i am waiting for the last two seasons to go prime . great comedic performances and it just gets better as time goes on ... .
i watched this anime expecting a few different things , especially the outcome , however it was really good . i 'm a guy and i still found this to be very enjoyable . worth looking into .
it was watchable , but not sure i 'd recommend it to a friend . the wife thought it was dumb , but a good time suck for me .
a lot better then i expected . i 'm not a big zombie person but this movie kept me on the edge of my seat
it is a great movie and every one family should watch it . you will enjoy it and so will the family
good movie . good actors . i was not really sure what to expect but it was okay and us adults enjoyed it .
ca n't say much except i am a big hunger games fan and the movie followed the book quite well . now i have both one and 2. ca n't wait for 3 .
this movie was interesting enough , and a good watch if you like a twist on vampire stories , especially on a lazy sunday afternoon .
i watch and read anything jane austen and thought anne hathaway and the rest of the cast did an excellent job with this very enjoyable movie .
being a james bond fan , i like this movie , but the ending is not one of the best . still it does have a set of interesting villains !
the characters did n't have a chemistry . the plot was dry . i am sorry i paid for this . i enjoy kevin costner movies but very disappointed in this one .
which i truly liked . i took my youngest niece to see in our local movie theater . she liked it too .
great movie stands up to other disney classics . started out a little slow but by the end it was great .
i remembered it from when it was first shown in the 1950 's and it 's fantastic to now own it . a great deal .
i have been enjoying watching these starting at the beginning and having a great time . thanks for making this available for such a good price !
bought this as a gift for a friend he was excited n loved it hes a big clint eastwood fan he has a collection of his movies n he was missing this one
i love this movie . seen it so many times over the years and so going to enjoy having it in my library .
while some details were off the mark this show is the star trek of the next decade . watch and remember .
i bought this movie for my daughter . she loves it and watches it when she has friends sleep over . fun family movie .
liked this movie but its not really one i would watch over and over and over again . but the story is solid and interesting .
do n't miss this one ! ! much better than the first season . i can hardly wait for season three . the coolest series around ! i ca n't stop watching once i begin .
this movie is a great the action is fantastic and the story is great it brought a lot of actors together to make an all star cast action movie great
i can watch this movie over over and over again . thor is one of my most loved movies in the world , second to the hunger games .
i had to watch this out of loyalty and it was cute and it did last long in my mind .
one of the greatest if not greatest series on world war 2. well worth the upgrade even if you already own it on dvd .
it tries to be a comedy , needs to be edited , the script could have been better , and a bit of a weak ending definitely not the best iron man , but worth seeing
i did n't expect this movie to be all that ! but jeremy renner made it fantastic ! ! ! it was action packed and full of all different countries ! loved it ! ! !
this was a really cute movie but i did n't think it was as good as the previous ones . there was lots of adventure and hilarious moments and i did enjoy it very much .
my family and i love watching this series . the quality is excellent . we also like seeing all the shows we might have missed when it first aired .
this is a classic film . i 'm glad that i was able to find it for blu ray . must have film .
i buy a lot of space stuff , and this dvd is a great one . it gives a unique perspective and i highly recommend it .
cute quirky show , i missed this when it originally aired and am catching episodes in my free time . fun , like the narrative .
gave this as a gift . the one who got it , enjoys it and watches one every weekend .
if you believe that in another world aliens can control us then this movie is for you . it is very intense and believable .
psycho is a wonderful horror movie of its time . a classic that should be viewed by all and appreciated for the piece of art that it is .
a good copy for a dvd . i rated it only 2 stars because i found it to be rather dull .
the story line keeps going on year after year but it is down so well that i do n't mind , because it is do n't so very well .
fond memories from childhood . probably wo n't work on today 's generation of youngsters , but that 's the way it goes i guess .
it tries too hard . it does n't promise much , but it surely delivers even less .
with all new types of special effects this one was pretty good . it had a decent story line and watched it through without being bored .
good actors doing a good job . my old time favorites that are ending their acting days . a plot that is a little plausible . no surprises .
my favorite is benny hills one night video stand . that 's on golden classics . this one is hit and miss for me
like watching ncis pick up more when watching again . catch things missed when again . you also get to know the cast better .
i am in anticipation each time for each new set . just cant wait for the next one . this is a great gift for anyone .
have always wanted to see him grow into superman ... and it was finally done . just wish he 'd learned to fly a little sooner in the series .
these are hard to find on tv . they took the show off netflix for some reason . i am trying to own the entire series because it is good watch again and again ,
grandkids loved it so much that i purchased it ! it will be a favorite in our family for a long time !
if you like old westerns then you will love this one . randolph at his finest . good plot and superb acting .
love the big bang theory , wanted to learn more about them ? the actor himself is pretty funny , especially when you get to know how much they act and not acting when playing the show .
this is one of those great fight movies from the roman days ... we do n't have enough of them as far as i 'm concerned . this is one of the better ones . i loved it .
jim carey at his best are you kidding me ! this is an all time classic if comedy , a must have in your collection !
this a great movie with excellant actors , a great story , and wonderful special effects . i am very happy they made this into a blu-ray .
this is a fantastic movie . this was a very funny movie and the animation was perfect . this movie is sure to become a classic .
transformers : a great way to spend an afternoon . it is amazing with the special effects .
it had a disturbing and unexpected ending . this movie makes one think about what or who we put our trust in .
this movie as a family we all liked it , was n't sure if everyone in the family would like it but they did .
i liked the original movies but this was more true to the original story and spider man 's wit is more like how i remember the comics . a lot of fun to watch .
well it is series ... . it is what i expected . sexy female lead with many interesting character with far out ideas ... .it is entertainment .
this is a movie . it was made to entertain . just relax and watch it . its not great but its not bad .
our family enjoyed this movie two or three times at the drive in theater before it came out on dvd . we still love it . thank you !
reminds me of books i read high school . i watched all 3 season back to back in a few weeks . i wish their was a few more seasons .
product was great , condition was better than stated . arrived in a timely fashion . would absolutely use this seller again and would recommend them to anyone .
this one was my favorite . of course , it was the first one cruise did . they are always the best . great movie to add to collection .
i love this movie , it is full of action . very impressed and i watch this all the time . buy it .
not as funny . camera work was terrible at the end . no subtitles . fans would only watch this one once .
classic disney movie . love it . the kids always enjoy watching toy story over and over again . adults can enjoy as well
i love this story ! i wish it had another sequel but that would n't make sense . tarantino rocks ! i love all if his work !
the production value on this was great and the acting was good . but the story line was so campy ... .i loved it ! !
good , wholesome family horse movie for all audiences . i enjoyed it and think most would . you could feel free to show it anyone .
i ca n't praise this collection enough . the movies are truly over the top ! i will keep this collection as one of my favorites !
i love this show . so glad they have this one . i have enjoyed seeing these again . if you like british humor you will enjoy this .
i really like matthew mcconaughey who did a great job with this movie but i especially like the two boys who were featured in the movie , reese witherspoon not so much .
i have been a huge fan of the show since its start and could n't wait to order this season as soon as it was available .
another very good movie . all 3 stars do an excellent job of acting and the story line is both interesting and entertaining . i would definitely recommend this video for a rental .
i had seen the original movie before and knew i like it , and while the sequel was ok , i would have been just as well off to just buy the original .
must be a good movie for me to try for the whole series , right ? i only buy movies i know are great !
it is a pretty good movie . most kids will enjoy it ; it is very colorful and creative . buy it now !
not as good as i thought it would be , but i was still laughing out loud for sure ! love it .
season 3 is everything i expected it to be . it was exciting , humorous , witty and made me cry . i ca n't wait for season 4
this is a nice series . it 's well worth it , compared to what 's on tv today . i still wonder if the series continues . quite entertaining
this is a very good tv series it has every thing that you want in a movie excellent special effects good actors the bluray is great .
could not truly understand what they were saying . not well laid out and very little commentary . there were too many cuts !
got ta love this old classic . just wanted to replace my old tape version . always leaves me with a smile ... very enjoyable
i usually love the resident evil series but this is time i will never get back after having watched this movie . now i can say i see why they should stop making movies after 3 .
good plot but i felt rushed through the movie was this a zombie , action family what kind of movie was this ? not really good
complicated plot , took a long time to figure it out . tom cruise did a good acting job along with the other cast .
i do n't really know what exactly i liked about this movie but , it kept my attention . kind of strange , about the dead father , though ...
i am a sucker for these british cop series and this is another good one . the main character seems to struggle with relationships and life but pull it together in time to solve the crimes .
i bought this season for my teenage son . he has enjoyed it as much as i did when i was a child
i enjoy these kind of movies . simple , entertaining , clean , good acting . a good family show which i would highly recommend .
this is a movie we enjoy . it arrived quickly after being ordered and was in good shape . we were pleased with the purchase .
very quick delivery on all products ! dvds in perfect condition ! ! i am definitely a huge fan now ! ! great series that we enjoyed ! we ordered every season that is available ! !
made this movie even more sentimental ! i got it for my step dad because he has all the fast and furious movies . it was really good . lots of twists and turns !
this is great to watch and geared toward adults in the language . buy it now . this would make a great beer drinking game .
my mom loves this movie so i got it for her for mothers day . she totally loved it . thanks for helping make it a special day .
i hate this show . it has some funny parts in it but overall , it 's stupid .
if you grew up anywhere in the & # 34 ; woods & # 34 ; this story will find a place in your heart . jodie foster is at her best .
this was a delight to watch ! i enjoyed this with several of my friends ! we laughed and cried and it got us to talk about our early days of mother hood ! chick flick for sure !
what 's not to like ? marilyn , looking great , a funny story and great acting from all involved . if you 're only going to own one marilyn movie , this is the one to have .
one of the all-time great tv series , it 's too bad that this season ended up being the last one of them .
we did not like this movie . too much violence and full of zombie junk ! prefer movies of real live things not fantasy horror .
this is a good movie . hope all players will watch this movie and learn that there are girls out there who wont let you mess with them ... . lol
i bought every installment of this franchise it is great family fun . we enjoy watching them over and over again .
this movie was so cool . the whole family enjoyed it . i would recomend everyone to get this movie . it was also funny .
i enjoyed the avengers but did n't understand all the underlying character issues . i decided to watch all the individual movies . thor was very good and i look forward to thor 2 .
i have loved this movie every since it came out . it all comes together in the end an inspiring friendship , love and hope for all . you will love it too .
beautiful picture and great detail . colors pop and is candy for the eyes . great movies for kids . glad i purchased this blu ray .
one of my all-time favorites . all actors were excellent . story was original . scenery gorgeous . magical and romantic . touching and funny . i re-watch it ever few years .

having never watched 24 we started from season one . we are addicted . season three has turned out to be the best season yet !
i love still standing . it is both disappointing and frustrating that it is not yet available on dvd ! very funny series . i would love to own it !

have the prince and me movie - so this was a great addition to my collection .
well made video of ' a christmas carol ' -- i did n't think i would like it as much as the other versions , but i do . i shall keep in in our holiday viewing library .
i love this show ! ! great dvd 's ! in great condition and great picture and sound . nothing was wrong ! i love it ! ! !
i buy movies that i have viewed at one time or another . also i usually buy movies based on the reviews i read .
i give it 4 stars for the visual effects only . you need to buy all 3 disks of the set to enjoy the story plot .
watch out this version is in italian with no english subtitles . but it is a great movie worth watching again and again .
this is a great zombie movie that you ll enjoy . has plenty of suspense and keeps you wanting more . great plot and ending .
this film has drama , great plot and intense action . if you want a film that will keep in suspense than this film is for you .
one hoped there would be a happy ending for someone that had such a hard life which was not the case .
this west wing episode is so poignant and moving that i always cry . if you 're looking for intelligent television , this is a must see .
my children and i watch it every halloween ! a family holiday tradition ~ sit back and enjoy some of tim burton 's classic animation ... no one does it quite like mr. burton !
its very well done very interesting . i was not at all familiar with the different aspects of the ocean and this brought that world to life .
i did n't like it very much , because there is a lot of violence and it has a sad ending and i do n't like sad endings .
there is really no reason why i purchased these movies , but the movies are fun to watch the trouble everyone gets into .
the acting was superb , but that was the only reason i gave this two stars . this was a boring , disjointed , dark movie . it really had no point and was hard to follow .
entertaining , pleasant , feel good movie . i love anything cary grant and this was an excellent romance movie . i highly recommend this movie . a+
this has long been one of my favorite movies and i have wanted to replace my vhs version for quite some time and i finally did it . it is even better on blu-ray .
finally i have the whole series and it 's a hoot . always liked seinfeld .
back to the future is seriously the best movie of all time . the other two are just as worthy , but part 1 is amazing ... ! ! ! !
it should have been a great flick if i 'd received all of it ! i only got part 2 thanks for nothing !
alfred hitchcock movies are timeless and the stars in these are what make them classics ... i like hitchcock and i have not been disappointed at all
i bought the first season and fell in love watching this show . i have bought all of the seasons . the shows are funny and makes me laugh a lot .
ok , so not a very close adaptation to the book , but in itself a great story .
a go to movie when i need a laugh . love the chemistry between hugh grant and sarah jessica parker . good
i really liked it . it was great acting by everybody . lot of action and adventure with good scenes . thank you
entertaining show i like it , to bad it ended on the first season . i 'd like to see more . it was fun

great movie , i love the quick humor . it was fast paced with a good storyline . i am glad i bought it .
i am not a fan of glee but my granddaughter is and watches these over and over if she likes it that is all that matters
i did n't remember really what it was about but i know i did n't like it but its was not good at all .
these guys can still rock and gary still sounds great live . the dvd has almost all of there hits . there new stuff is also good as well .
grimm is quite different it is a fairy tale for grown ups . very imaginative ! ! you never know what character is going to pop out each week .
saw this on t.v . and being a big bruce lee fan and growing up during the 70 's , i had to buy it for my collection ! !
i can always count on the sellers on amazon to have exactly what i need . i bought this movie for a cousin , who had been wanting it for some time .
one of the few movies that you can watch over and over again without it ever getting played out . throughly entertaining from beginning to end .
clean and fun sci-fi . not as dark and mature as stargate universe . most of this felt like a clear good vs evil . excellent effects budget and decent acting for a tv sci-fi .
i got this for my parents to watch and they watch it a lot . they love to spend a day just watching different movies .
this was a very entertaining story for adults as well as children . i was surprised at how much i enjoyed it . main character has a cute attitude . great 3d movie .
this was my favorite movie when i was a kid and now , decades later its my kids favorite movie also .
very entertaining , great show with an excellent cast . i found the stories to be absolutely hilarious . four more word required ... .
great series , very true to life . one of the best series i have seen , funny , well done , sorry it ended . the actors were great .
i really expected more from the cast and the director . was disappointed . wish i had my hour and a half back .
bought this for my husband who loves these old movies . i 'm not sure if he 's watched it yet , but i know he will enjoy it when he does !
robert downey n jude law were both excellent in fact the whole cast the scenes were all so believable
my family and i really enjoyed watching this movie . we are fans of mythology and this movie was right on !
i love this movie . the action is great ! the comedy is fall of your seat laughing . definitely the best sherlock holmes !
this movie is fairly true to the book - as true as hollywood can get that is . it is enjoyable and worth watching .
it was a good dvd because big show and mark henry broke the ring . very entertaining and fun to watch .
throughly enjoyed this film . 20th century fox made some wonderful musicals . what fun they are to watch . i look forward to purchasing more .
this is one of the few times that a sequel was about as good as the original . big name cast that must have had a ball making it .
i really loved this big time rush season 1 volume 2 dvd set . the episodes are awesome . the bonus features are wonderful . i would recommend this dvd set to anyone .
well , it has not been released yet and i can not say anything about the quality of blu-ray yet , but the show itself is 5 stars . it is well worth watching .
i am not a fan of this movie in the least bit . it was horrible and i am sad i wasted money and time watching it
the 5 star is for the content and the speed in which it was delivered . recommend for any and all who love police drama .
great love story and proves you do n't need to have all th garbage to make it great ! my whole family enjoyed it !
i love mysteries and was recommended to try this show . i love it ! the characters are well acted and crafted , the scripts are clever and the action is filmed well .

i loved this , because i love these kind of films , of by gone days . there was something so charming and nice about life back than .
if you like will smith movies this is a good one . funny and full of action .
i found all the characters in this story to be really entertaining . glenn close - what can i say but - wonderful .
for an 80 's flick , it has held up well . thoroughly enjoyed the extras and movie again . good enough to watch over and over again .
this is type of movie that keeps you interested . it has the suspense , action , and more . i would recommend this movie to those who enjoy a really good action movie .
wow what a wonderful movie it was very well played and made me feel good for start to finish wow
this would not play on my blu-ray player but works fine on dvd so make sure you have a dvd player before ordering this .
this about a young boy who write to our soldier over sea and the soldier fall in love with his mom which is a great story to watch with the family and friends
one more great performance for pierce brosnan . pierce is at his best when he plays complicated characters . well worth an addition to your movie collection .
i love this movie . i share it with my students every year . it arrived just in time for my unit .
though this show has been around for a long time , it is worth watching again . not all of it is spectacular , but perry makes up for the sometimes corny plot lines .
cute for younger kids . my grand daughter is 3 1/2 and she sat and watched all of it . cute family video .
this is a great movie for adults as well as kids , i 've watched it now several times and enjoyed every time . : o )
even though this movie is based on a book , i think that the actresses do a wonderful job of creating a story worth watching .
out for justice is one of steven seagal 's best movie . it looked even better on blue ray . the fight scenes were epic . steven seagal was amazing in this movie .
too much cussing but paul is totally cool and it keeps me constantly laughing , while being a warm movie too .
orginal bought for her but end up kept for myself ... good movie . i like it ... amazing movie . she enjoyed it as well .
had mixed emotions at the end it just let you hanging without a resolution to say the least . maybe i missed it . like the movie plot but it needed a better ending for the hero .
first of all this movie should be on dvd . i loved this movie and if you have not seen it , you should ! ! ! ! !
jack frost was wonderful . the santa need some work . but over all it was a good movie . thank you for your time .
i believe this was one of the best bond movies pierce brosnan made . the tech was a thrill and in true bond style . i enjoyed it from the first chase to the last .
great fun movie and sean connery , what could be better . donald sutherland is great also . great product and service . love it .
i do not know what it is about that cold little island that makes such interesting people . a real fun comedy !
simply amazing as always ! : ) i loved the story and that it came to me in one piece . thank you !
i have been wanting to see this great movie again for a long time . thanks amazon for having it available .
this is one of the best series on tv . very enjoyable , well written , good acting - good everything ! i do n't have much time for writing but will say that i highly recommend this series .
ever part of the move is good . if you can get past the subtitles you will love it.. definately worth buying
this is a beautiful movie . just try to not cry at the ending - i doubt you 'll be able to stop the tears . this is pixar at its best ! !
it held my 2 year old 's attention for about 15 minutes and that was the end of it . so i turned it off , .
this movie was mediocre at best . very dull at certain points . three stars and no more . you be the judge
my kids were so excited . it is too repetitive . however , i like having a classic entertainment around . my youngest watched one disc with me .
i enjoyed the all 3 of the spider man movies and this one is a good one to get if you like the 2nd one .
i cried so hard at the end . i just loved this movie . dustin hoffman rules .
a must see movie . you will rarely stop laughing . the characters are great . really a classic movie . safe for kids to watch !
i loved her show and am happy to have added this set to my library . i have another set of her show .
this volume has all of the greatness of the first volume but taken to another level . the acting is superb and the action is top notch . these two movies should be part of any film fans collection .
i was very impressed when i saw these shows on the discovery channel . i have been absolutely amazed to see them in hd . i recommend this to anyone who enjoyed these shows . awesome !
this is the funniest movie i have ever seen . i ordered it because of my mother ... ..i have never seen her laugh so hard at any movie .
missed seeing it , and finally saw it and have no regrets . i am glad i finished the series . loved them all .
whatever the hype against this movie is all about ... it was fantastic . nicole kidman and john cusack deliver stellar performances . watch it .
i enjoy watching late at night when there is nothing else on tv to watch . i just would like them to bring out new dvd series sooner . great series .
get it ! ... blu-ray lives up to it name and standard and if you really like this film you 'll appreciate even more , worth the purchase ! !
i enjoy this blu-ray . it was delivered as advertised and is a good value for the money . i am glad i purchased it .
i followed twilight and the build up to this move was great but after i watched this movie it was kinda a let down . it just was n't as good as the others .
this was is a classic movie my daughter was surprised to get this dvd . she wanted it for some time now she own this movie .
would watch again , very good and scary movie . would recommend to all my friends , do n't watch in the dark alone .
this classic movie is a favorite of mine . replacing old vhs movies for dvd format . waiting to see new version .
good for a classic movie , but not great like some of the other vincent price classics . you will enjoy it , but not be dying to see it again .
this was a really great feel good movie , i have watched it several times . i found out the two actors are actually married in real like and that made it even better .
i really loved this movie have not seen it since i was a kid i really enjoyed seeing it again
amazing twisted series . have n't enjoyed a series like this in years . very addictive so beware , you will want to know the ending .
it was fun to watch . i have always liked charlton heston . i just wish that more of his movies were on prime .
for a used item , plays really well and brings back great sitcom memories . will have to purchase the entire series because this was a great show ! ! !
i saw this movie as a teen i loved it bought for my teen and she loves this movie it was delivered quickly and plays perfect

was so excited when i got this , i love this show it showed up before they said it would and in perfect condition
i have always enjoyed andy griffith in movies and all his tv shows . i 'm sure you will enjoy this show as well .
i think that next to the lion king , this is an excellent cartoon movie . very entertaining for parents and kids .
loved the story line . really great actors . had a twist that none of us expected . most definitely recommend it ! will be watching it again .
the final chapter or is it ? great fight scenes and the visual scenes are tremendous . the actors are grand and the hero is superb . i recommend this dvd !

i seen this movie on tv but in only in small bits and not the whole movie . i am so glad that i bought the movie . it was very good .
most of the original crew of `` are you being served '' so if you are a fan this is ok. they are a lot older and out of the store .
this was a very good and entertaining movie . my wife and i enjoyed it since it was a family friendly film . it was a good story with an interesting plot twist at the end .
i liked it even though it was not exactly what i had been waiting for all these years . i will enjoy it for years to come .
true to the times with the costumes and cultures this movie is an amazing example of how things were and how they changed . beautifully written and acted .
i do not like being required to write a specific number of words to tell some one i got what i wanted
it was completely predictable and extremely slow moving . i was surprised that these 2 great stars were in this movie .
we have been watching this show since it began and it was fun to begin the series over again . if you want a truly great tv escape with interesting characters ... check this show out ! ! !
great j. stewart western , one of his best . kind of `` dark '' , but still great movie .
this is for men , not for women . i walked out of the room and my husband stayed until the end .
i enjoyed this movie as it reflects my generation during the 1960 's vietnam era where a bunch of guys go through military training and are sent to vietnam . i can truly identify .
every dad should watch this movie ! it has some great insight and messages ! they did a good job and with each movie they get better and better .
while not exactly true to history , i very much enjoyed the film . i first saw the film in the late 1950 's . thank you for making it available .
you get what you get when you sign on for a chick flick , they did a good job . it was a cute movie .
a very unexpected purchase . was not for sure how i would like this but it was a excellent sit on the edge of your seat
one of the best comedy shows of all time . wish they 'd do an updated version .
just love glee wish there were more show like that i do n't think there been a bad show the whole time its been on the air
awesome the acting was really good and the story man it had some issues , but this does happen in real life . loved it ! !
i love movies ! this one is so cute . i love katherine heigl , she is a pleasure to watch . plus , many other good actors to enjoy .
very enjoyable . had not seen this one before and was n't sure what to expect . it was very good and i would watch again .
i wanted the extra behind the scenes and the commentary the comes along with the blu-ray . if you are buying this movie then you most likely already know what to expect and it worked great .
thanks and god bless for providing this much appreciated product for our family . thank you thank you thank you
anyone who has a child ( girl or boy ) should watch this documentary with them ! never say it could n't happen to you .
fantastic series for my christmas movie collection . action , drama and comedy that children and adults can watch together . famous actors and entertaining plot line .
love these movies . bought the trilogy and am looking forward to sharing them with others . can not say enough good stuff about it .
this movie is so interesting . the little girl that is the star of this movie is a wonderful actress . the movie has so many interesting parts .
this is a fun movie that you can watch time and again . great performances by everyone . the story is fun and funny .
we love this movie , than again we have enjoyed the series . johnny deep is a great actor and does n't disappoint in this movie for us . great to have on the go .
excellent tv series for people who enjoy mysteries , alfred hitchcock or sherlock holmes . always twists and turns towards a surprise ending .
if you can get past an aging mel gibson playing a young man , you will probably like this film as much as most people have .
for a nicolas cage movie i was not that impressed it was not a good roll for him but it was also an older film so i guess you have to start some where .
two great actors come together for a exciting and funny movie with all the action one needs . do n't miss it .
such a sweet movie with a great twist at the end that i never saw coming . i love romantic suspense stories .
good film , good acting and a good story line . it will keep your attention from beginning to end . mark wahlberg makes the movie work , he plays this role well and is very believable .
one word says it all . horrible ! i 'm shocked that john goodman would lower himself to be in this film . times must be tough .
i was very surprised how good this version is . glad to add it to my collection . we have 3 versions and watch one each night christmas eve eve to christmas eve to christmas night . great !
this is a cute story and everyone in our family enjoyed it . we parents did and so did our 21 month old and our 8 year old . we had lots of laughs !
this is a fun and funny tv show . the six friends on this show are like & # 34 ; friends , & # 34 ; but they are british , and very , very funny .
this show is too funny and just a good straight out funny comedy show to watch . well worth the money .
running out of things to say . have always loved shows that require a brain to get the job done . excellent .
i did n't understand this movie , and i will give it another shot , but i 'd watch patrick swayze read the phone book for 2 hours . he 's another gifted actor gone too soon .
he is a very talented young man . a very good comedian . very much worth the money to purchase the dvd
it 's really sweet simple and cute . my 2 year old loves it and we can stand it too . i have seen it 5 times now . it was worth the price .
we love all these movies and unfortunately i had to return it because i did not realize they were already in our dvd library .
that is all i can say . after that the blood and gore became a little too much to handle . i know it is a true story , but really .
this series has a good cast and reasonable writing , good entertainment and easy to like characters , a better than average sitcom .
i love everything about like band of brothers , the pacific tell you about the war with japan once more time how was the war
love the movie . dvd was good quality . if you like clint eastwood then i would recommend this movie to you .
love this movie . i watch it quite a bit . never gets old . i 'm an old sci fi movie fan and the thing , them , and war of the worlds are my favorites .
funny and dramatic i enjoy the back and forth between the leads . nice female lead series . not a boring show .
i like kevin costner and have been collecting his movies for some time , , , kind of expensive to cross over from vhs to dvd but they last longer ...
ok. i did like the movie more so for the action sequences than anything else . i never thought harrison ford would play a part in a movie like this . i did enjoy it though .
was n't as bad as i thought it would be . figured out the plot by mid movie . if you are a arnold or sly fan then give it a view .
there is n't much i can say here . the movie was great on the big screen and is great still on my 60 & # 34 ; tv .
it was a good movie , but not quite what i was expecting . good cast and the acting was not bad . would recommend but read up more about what it is about
it arrived very quickly . i have not had the time to view it yet but i am hoping that is it in good condition .
i love this movie very funny i think the 1st one was the best i hope people order this movie
we are fans of matlock - the closed captions are new ( i think ) and are helpful .
fast service . excellent condition . i like old movies and the old stars that play in them . thank you .
the movie is timeless and fun . it would have been great to have a commentary track and some other extras .
this movie is amazing . blu ray makes all the difference though . you should see the difference and judge for yourself
i saw this movie years ago and loved it . i still love it and enjoy all the actors in it . i recommend this to everyone .
love most things bbc . sherlock is great . a bit dark at times but entertaining none the less . ca n't wait to see season 4
i was surprised by the storyline . was n't what i was expecting from the dark knight . good actors as usual . i think it 's worth buying a copy and watching again .
this season was consistent with the high quality i grew to expect from the production crew of this show . we need shows like this today .
this is a much better version of the classic movie . it is more realistic and the story is better told with this added material .
once again , channing tatum is the bomb . he is one great actor as well as the other actors in this action pack adventure . i would recommend it to anyone who likes action movies .
brad pitt is one of our favorite actors . he is just great in this movie . what a thriller right up to the end . it will have you on the edge of your seat ...
has to be one of the top 100 of all time . this blu-ray is perfect ! ! !
saw this film recently while taking time out to relax and simply view films missed in the late evening . this film `` caught '' my attention for the acting `` and '' clever plot !
i want to have the entire collection for my library so i can enjoy watching these great characters over and over again . these 2 completed made my collection complete .
this movie was made after the series firefly aired . the dvd was in perfect condition - just as described by the seller . it arrived very quickly . i would definitely buy from this seller in the future .

the movie was cute . i enjoyed to see a movie where someone works hard to get what they wanted . i absolutely loved the movie
i liked this movie but actually purchased the dvd for my grandson who wanted it . but you just ca n't beat bob hope and bing cosby as a comedy team .
story was ok , graphics , special effects were good but not great . as i said worth a rent and not a buy .
good plot , good acting . dennis quaid delivers his usual good performance and the story is edge of your chair action .

fun , entertaining , and pretty good . i enjoyed it . like adding it to my library . like i needed another dvd . oh well . worth watching
i read the book a few times and hoped that the movie would be just a good . i absolutely loved it and will enjoy watching it many times on blu ray .
denzel and mark have good chemistry as actors and seem to work together well . a touch of humor between the characters and lots of action makes for an enjoyable movie .
the books were wonderful and the movie does not disappoint . my husband had not read the books , and he really liked the movie . it made him want to read the books .
i thought the first season was excellent and this second season continues in excellence . very entertaining and the characters are quite engaging . i highly recommend it .
i like that this series grabs you right from the beginning . when an episode ends i ca n't stop . i keep moving onto the next one .
it was a very action packed season with both good ( happy ) points and bad ( sad ) points . you wont want to miss it !
i love this series and have watched it from the beginning i would recommend this to anyone who loves csi miami the storylines are great
i was so very glad to get this movie , i had never seen it but heard about it ... thanks for a great movie and a great price ... i love amazon ... ..
i 'm pretty sure i saw this on tv , but did n't know the title , it 's an interesting premise , but lacks the climax .

this movie surprised me . i thought it was just a love story but it is very interesting and has a mysterious plot and is not boring at all ! !
it so bad i could n't watch the whole movie the acting , the script , it not well develop it one of those movies if you have nothing better to do really pass
i really enjoyed it . the plot did n't have many surprises but with great acting , it became a great movie .
it was an unusual movie that attempts to keep the watcher confused and is successful at that throughout the movie . a movie to see once , but not twice
this is one of the best movies made . great stars and great action . must buy for all .
loved this movie when it came on tv . so nice to be able to buy it . it is a very sweet movie .

there is plenty of action in this one . interesting plot with twists and turns that were unexpected . a good action flick .
good movie ! just not a lot of depth about the man ! it tells the story about what happened to the man , but not much about the man himself .
birthday gift for my husband who is learning to play guitar . he loves it and says it is very helpful
it is the x-men 2 movie , i love it some prefer more along the comics . i like wolverine played by jackman , have all the movies now .
this is a little slow to get to the action compared to what i remember and today 's standards . my 17 year old daughter kept falling asleep and never did get to the exciting parts .
before i knew it , the movie was over . it went by so fast . keeps you stuck to the screen . ca n't wait for the next one
emotions so strong that you dont know to cry of cheer , so you end up doing both at the same time . what an incredibly powerful feeling to have .

i actually owned this movie years ago . i love the indian culture and the film is romantic , sexy in a nice way and beautifully filmed . enjoyed it .
an excellent review , though the god issue should have been left out as it has nothing to do with life .
do not usually like this kind of a movie , but hugh laurie made it all worth while .
the first movie to put a comedy team together with universal 's monsters . the funniest movie of this genre hands down .
the best modern american writer of fiction was robert parker his tone , dialog and detail is flawless . in stone cold tom selleck does an amazing job and the cast is first class .
wonderful show . i ca n't get enough of it . so glad there are 4 seasons of this show and they are on prime . i 'll be sad to finish the series .
very fun movie just goes to show you that when it is not your child it is that much harder
i can relate a lot to this move , thats why i had to have it . i would definitely recommend it to others .
if you like house , then this series will be no exception . if nothing else , he keeps us entertained even in his worst moments .

ever since the james bond flicks went to blu-ray , this is the one i wanted to get . one of the great bond flicks .
this show is wonderful ... ... drama , action and a story that really makes you ask questions . perfect ! !
this movie was full of action and suspence . had a great time watching it . was a bit better than expected because it had some interesting twists to the plot .
some of the episodes of season 2 were good , others were not . some of the episodes left me disappointed at the end . i sort of liked it , but not as much as season 1 .
i was pretty upset with the dvd version of this film . but the blu-ray really comes through . the picture is great and so is the sound .
there is always something special about the blu-ray form that makes the movie even better .
i recommend this series for every age . great life lessons and wonderful views . i miss this kind of tv show and i they had more today .
this is my favorite out of the two . wish there was more sequels . one of those movies that i can watch over and over again .
absolutely adorable . the entire family gets a kick out of this movie . i especially love the clothes ... it 's a hoot !
this movie is just great . if you love a good underdog story with some bits of humor mixed in you 'll love this . apparently it 's very accurate to real life events .
this is one of my all time favorite movies . tom cruise and brad pitt are at their best in this one .
good , but very , very creepy . sorry i watched it ; not really a fan of creepy movies . definitely a different type of role for kevin costner .
i thought there was a lot of improvement over the original , but the original is still very powerful . so if you liked the original , then you should like this .
terrific movie . i like this actor and unique movies . it is amazing what people think up to get children 's attention . i would recommend this movie to anyone .
showed up fast and in excellent condition ! very pleased ! well worth the order ! thanks for such good service !
very entertaining and fast moving . i enjoyed it a lot . i am a super hero and syfy nut and it was right down my alley .
almost the last one to complete the series in my collection - being a sci-fi fanatic - i love this one
it was ok to watch , but the story line was thin . the special effects were good . had to be the same team from the first one .
received in a very timely manner and in great condition . i would definitely order from this vendor again !
anyone that loves toby keith will love this , all his best video clips are on this and he is at his best
kind of a confusing movie . my husband liked it more than me . i would have preferred to rent this from the red box instead .
the story & plot of this movie kept you drawn to it it is not to action packed or fast paced though
bought for my special needs daughter . she loves dogs and this is one of her favorite movies . a good movie .
of course the little guy that got this for christmas loved it . probably still watching it . sorry for the late thank you

danny devito was amazing in this movie . the entire cast was outstanding . it covers many life situations that bring different people together . highly recommend this movie .

all of these biblical stories that i recently bought , are so i can watch them any time that i please .
film quality is fine but 3d player wo n't recognize the 3d version . so i guess it is luck as to what players will or wo n't read the disc .

typical 70 's british horror . i like movies like this as i grew up watching them on saturday nights . not scary but quite entertaining .
i enjoy the suspense and the drama of finding the answer by traveling to international sites . johnny depp is great in this role .
these shows are done in a very scientific way its just a good show and everyone should watch this with a open mind .
i remember watching this movie with my father . now , as a grandfather , i try to show my grandkids , what tv was like , when i was a child . very good family movie .
michael douglas & glen close , are two of my favorite actors ! i could watch this movie , over & over again ! !
good movie , with some funny parts . the storyline is far fetched and would never happen but overall was a good rental .
i really liked this movie . i thought everyone did a really good job portraying the characters . it was heart warming and enjoyable to watch .

this a good classic . just wanted to see it again ; its been a while . six more words are required : there .
very good movie very enjoyable for the whole family , little slow at times but on the whole i liked it
after we watched the home version we went to the theater for the 3d experience . an absolutely amazing story which took us by surprise .
well this movie took a long time getting here and it was not spoken in the right language but may not order again sorry not happy
i loved the movie and really excited to see a tv series based on it . i was a little sad that it did not last past season one - volume one , was hoping it would come back .
wonderful , humorous , and heartfelt stories with that incredible british humor . the characters and story lines are so great i keep going back to watch them again .
despicable me is a cute movie with a good message about being good or bad . it is n't just for kids . very enjoyable .

this is a great story for our little girls . it tells the story of being the best you that you are . i am sure this is a new classic .
forget the `` hokey '' title , this is a great movie . it 's incredibly funny in parts and has almost non-stop action . oh yes , and the animation is good too .
i got interested in this show by only a few minutes into the first episode ! what an awesome show ! def recommend ! !
this was fun to go back and see this old show again . we used to watch it every sunday when i was a kid and this was well put together and just like i remembered the show .
love watching these with my kids . they seem to love it as much today as i did yesterday . recommend if you want to remember yesterday with your kids .
we have it on vhs and wanted it on dvd . this is a really funny movie and we love how it ends . dean jones was perfect for the roll
two great actors , a great supporting cast , a great director , and a wonderful script . it all works in this movie . classic buddy movie . a must for a complete dvd collection .
i bought this film to show to my film class . it did not fail to satisfy : educational and entertaining . go gore !
the bar room scene alone is worth the price of admission . great acting , directing , and fun , fun , fun . how about an overlooked gem like this ?
i am so happy to have something under the tree for my baby to open up . she will be surprised .
i been waiting on this movie for a long time and now i have it i can watch when i want to without asking someone else to let me use there
not one of my favorites would have like it better if the killer had been caught , and her body had been found
what can i say ? i love this show . but let 's face it , we need more sex , blood and yes ... more sex : )
i love the old fred and ginger movies ! i could watch them again and again ! this is a good collection .
got it for my wife . what she sees in this junk , i do n't know but she loves it . not my style
i liked the film and especially in blu ray . it really makes you wonder what really goes on behind the scenes of the catholic empire .
not a bad movie ; decent plot , good roles by the leads and an okay move to watch if you 're looking for action with a little story .
fun family friendly retelling of a classic . my daughter loves the film . this is the second time we have rented it .
lots of action . great actors . 3d is awesome for this movie . will not disappoint . even if super hero movies is not your thing . this one still grabs your attention .
this movie is extremely funny and worth buying it . i have no doubt if you buy this movie you wont regret it .
honestly , this movie is the funniest movie i have seen in ages . i 'm glad to see some movies have still got it .
meet me in st. louis is a wonderful movie , especially during the holiday season , purchased one for myself and one as a gift , and it just came out on blu-ray .
gave this five stars as this is an excellent christmas movie to add to your christmas collection ! it wo n't disappoint and i recommend this movie to anyone looking for a different yet classic christmas movie .
this is a great example of how children 's movies are becoming great for everyone . terrific animation , and good humor throughout .
how can you not enjoy this movie and now that they finally put it on dvd makes it even better great movie to watch ... .
if you are a vincent price fan , this is a must for your collection . i love most of 50s horror and sci-fi and this movie ranks . it 's entertaining with great acting .
why would anyone think this guy is funny ? he is funny looking , but still ca n't tell a joke to ... 20 .
the christmas special added characters and events featured in season 3 and was enjoyable to watch . recommended for any viewers who missed it when originally shown .
here is a character that can have a few more stories written ... even though , so far it is a similar story line ... it had to start somewhere !
this movie follows the book very closely . it really makes you feel this characters hunger not only for food , but for freedom of the human spirit and mind .
such a good show . i remember watching these back in the 90s . tv is n't like that anymore . it 's wonderful that i was able to find these shows on amazon .
this movie was very predictable and the acting was only so-so . the subject matter was good but i would not highly recommend it . it could have been much better .
fun movie to waste a rainy afternoon . this is the best one of the rush hour series . chris tucker keeps you laughing .
jag was such a great program and was sad to see it go but glad i am able to get the second season . have the first as well .
one of our favorite series ever . not only good acting but good stories . looking forward to the next season already .
i have not watched the movie yet have heard good reviews on it so i will try and watch it this weekend
this is the best sitcom ever . i love every minute of big band theory . its humor unlike any humor on tv right now
i do n't think there 's really a reason to rate the movies ( you either like them or you do n't ) , but as far as the purchase goes , i feel it was a great deal .
such fake you have never seen and no action worth watching . do n't waste your money one this one . the acting it even good . short and very bad .
classic black and white tv with perfect picture quality and excellent sound , better than when it originally was on air .
great movie . great effects . do n't listen to the negative comments . this was great sci-fi . extras were ok but since i do n't watch them they did n't matter . lol
great movie . i have 3d and love all the 3d movies any way . this was a fun ride . but nothing like number 1 mib
great movie for whole family including adult humor . 2nd time watching and saw things that we missed the first time looking forward to sequel
i was happy to be able to get the entire series as it is packaged . the price was good and it arrived promptly after i ordered it .
i 'm so glad that i bought this ! i really enjoy this show , and these dvds are pretty good quality . this definitely beats having to load each episode on the internet .
this is one of my favorite movies ever . it is so funny and well done . i have watched it lots .
was a great movie and we have added this to our collection . i recommend this to others , and it received a five star because the packaging , movie and quality was excellent .
kick ass ! ! ! better than the first season , better locations for survival ... . i like this season because it is never boring
with smith , channing , and sutherland how could it be bad ? great story line , if you have never seen it you are missing out on great entertainment !
so fun , fast moving , lots of laughs , not sure what will happen next , and the ending just fine and spectacular
it was good but not a great movie . i enjoyed the message . it was a colorful movie . the acting was good as well but not great .
this was a great cast with a good mix of smart dialogue and action . a few plot twists kept it interesting through the end .
this movie was okay , not one of the best western i 've saw . but still okay . if you like westerns then you 'll like this movie .
this movie is a classic ! everyone needs to see it . and yes , it is definitely better than the johnny depp remake ...
it was great seeing these retro cartoons . i wish that they still made them like this . i give it 5 stars easily !
i purchased this movie to replace a vhs copy i had in my collection ... it is just an & # 34 ; ok & # 34 ; movie in my opinion ...
i do n't buy any movie unless it was worth it and great flick and a good price and it works well all in all great buy
good british mystery . not the one i thought it would be but i was n't disappointed at all .
i was very surprised with the story line , i thought it would be better than it was . it did n't keep my interest .
there have been other movie 's about this but not on this scale , well worth watch history . a little more true history could have been used , but well worth the money .
one star better than sylvester stallone and the expendables , i 'll say that . but , it 's close . seriously , just do n't watch this movie .
loved this movie when i was growing up and i just had to own it and amazon had it for a great deal .
i can not wait until the next season to come out . i watched them all so far and the last season leaves you wanting more .
if you havent gotten on board yet you need too . this is one great show . based on a comic book . the characters are great and the show has always had a good feel .
i very much enjoyed this excellent version of emma . the actors , the setting and the music were outstanding .
this movie has giant monsters fighting giant robots . if you 're not into cool things like that , you wo n't like this . otherwise , this movie is super fun .
if you are a star trek original series fan , there is no better way to enjoy it than on blu-ray .
i have this one at home on dvd , but was in need of entertainment and as i love this flick , i had to rent it .
a must have dvd for movie viewers and collectors . i purchased this movie for two family members and they were very happy to get this one .
i gave a review about this excellent purchase many weeks ago - what 's up ? i repeat - excellent dvd , quick service .
sidney poitier never disappoints ! this was a very enjoyable performance and well acted by everyone . it is always fun to see the underdog come out on top !
i 'd highly recommend this movie . the writers did a great job and kept to the original graphic novel . if your a fan of the comic book , you will enjoy this movie .
i just love old classics . these are the movies of all movies . just love old classics . i love the actors and actresses back then .
this movie is really good . you do n't have to like meryl streep to watch this . alec baldwin is terrific and the movie is very well made .
collecting entire series from season 1 on . this purchase was excellent . i would definitely recommend this to anyone . love this show .
i am so happy that i have fantasy island i have the first season now i have this i always like fantasy island .
i enjoy this movie . i watch it all the time . i like the actors and the music is great ! nice !
i had high hopes . it took a good while before we laughed , and the laughter never lasted too long . predictable and mildly entertaining is about as good as it gets .
once more another one that is not uncut but it is edited even though it makes up for it with extra scenes then the tv broadcast it would have been better uncut .
i bought this for a friend who grew up with this film . he said its a really good movie . that 's all i 've got for this review .
while i 'm a huge fan of sean connery bond movies this ranks right up there . lots of drama with classic bond humor as well
what can you say about madea ... another great hit for tyler . it always turns out madea 's way . great cast !
ok who here ca n't love the old top gun , awesome . . . . . . . . . . .
we have not viewed this item , yet . we watch lonesome dove and loved it . it came before it was due .
this is a great performance by bill cosby . there are only a few rare words of profanity . i have enjoyed this performance for years . i highly recommend this hilarious show to everyone .

plays perfectly fine . i watch it all the time . i hope to buy movies from you in the future . thanks
this is another excellent action packed movie . the whole family watch it not once but three times because of it ` s action packed adventure .
this was on the list of a 13 year old for christmas . he was happy to receive it . good deal .
brought me back to my childhood ! i couldnt wait to watch it with my older brother who i used to watch it with when we were little . good times .
this is a very good movie ! well worth you while to check it out ! ! it 's & # 34 ; happy & # 34 ; and & # 34 ; sad ' . well done !
was so happy that this item is now available on dvd . what a great show . i especially enjoyed the commentary provided on the disc .
the continuing story lines , and acting in this series is great . does n't seem so & # 34 ; put on & # 34 ; as a lot of cop shows on tv in recent years
i loved it when i was a kid and still do as an adult . always funny and a joy to watch .
this is an awesome movie , i would like to thank the seller for a speedy delivery and the dvd is in great shape and thank you amazon for bringing this product as well as many others to the public
we enjoyed watching the show when it aired on television so we were excited to find out we could buy the dvds . we really enjoyed watching and keep watching the series .
my two adult daughters asked me to buy this for them for christmas . they love this performance better than the movie and have watched it several times already .
we are currently living in st. thomas and know one of the & # 34 ; extras & # 34 ; in the film so wanted to watch and see familiar faces and places !
a must have addition to those great classic movies for the whole family you will enjoy for generations to come !
we purchased this a few months ago for our young kids and have enjoyed every episode . definitely a keeper in our house .
this show was one of my favorite all time shows . i really enjoyed every episode . and i highly recommend them to anyone .
classic walken . my wife and i both enjoyed this movie ... more than i thought i would . it is worth the rental .
i love this show . the characters are so well developed . i love the twists and turns of this show it is like real life .
this is an amazing movie . i had watched previously , but i could n't resist watch it again . beautiful , well-made , great performance , for me is perfect .
interesting series the actors are intense and involved in their characters , directing and development not as serious as the actors
i like a movie with a great storyline , that also has such good actors to bring it to life . this one is that kind of movie .
these two movies together is a great idea . i love both of these movies & all the stars . get these movies if you do n't already have them .
very good . a bit long towards the end . i liked the other hannibal movies more . very interesting look at his childhood .
we were looking for the new version of this movie and ran across this one . it 's a well produced movie without the singing , pretty good .
the fast and the furious was better , but this was the best of the sequels .
i love this show . it brings back so many good memories for me . thank you
i watched the movie with my daughters an i liked it because we visited ford theatre last year in dc . my daughters are talking about the civil war in school .
great movie ! loved the dogs and story line . received the movie in just a few day . anyone who loves dogs will love this movie
these are two nice old john wayne movies . they definitely are way better than his old `` b '' movie days . they are very enjoyable movies , and definitely worth seeing !
this movie , since i was 14 , has been in my top 10 favorite movies of all time . i love this movie and watch it whenever im sad . & # 60 ; 3
the movie was enjoyable , but the characters to me were emotionally rather flat as portrayed by the actors . not as exciting as i expected , but it was still entertaining .
well , i want to keep on , my wife and i watch it together . she has me hooked , i guess . enjoy .
i love the lord of the rings trilogy , this first movie was a bit of a disappointment . i did n't feel they developed the characters well enough .
we love old movies and of course the hepburn movies are wonderful . having four of them in one order is wonderful .
a musical with excellent actors a great story a classic all people world wide would love this dvd classic ! ! !
wow not what i thought it was going to be . bad watch not worth your time or money do n't bother
christopher lee a great actor as a vampire known as dracula . all 8 films he did are great .
based on earlier reviews i watched the movie but for some reason it bored me . maybe its the kind of film that needs an audience .
the movie is a classic , and the box set is beautiful . a must own for fans ...
another great dvd by the celtic thunder . truly a fun group to see and know you would have a great time singing along .
my toddler had zero interest in this it very fast paced there was no way i could do this with her and was not even relaxing to me
this is a great movie to watch and have fun with the actors and watch when ever you want to watch
put a big smile on my grandaughter face , arrived in condition as stated , i was very pleased .
was funny put a smile on my face but the acting was terrible . i like the actors just not a good storyline .
great first season i like this show i would not get it on dvd if i did not like it .
so glad we went with this series . for a show that is 20 years old , this rocks . thanks for offering .
always enjoyed gregory peck . i enjoy flying movies about ww ii . great movie . always wanted to own this movie and now i do .
a very exciting non-stop action film with wonderful acting . a real world thrill that is very entertaining . i highly recommend it .
this takes the most interesting topics for many babies and combines them ! it 's nothing short of fabulous ! it has a baby section , a dog section and a farm section .
as stated before , good acting and story line . this is right up there with downton abby . wish there was more !
this was an ok movie . i do n't regret having watched it , but am not sure i could sit through it again .
i am a superman fan to my core . so i definitely had to have this movie and it did not disappoint .
my husband teenage sons love this son . i 've tried watching and could n't last more than a few minutes . to each his own .
for some reason i never owned a tape version , but i am glad to own a dvd , just as much fun as i remembered it to be .
this movie was surprisingly very good . i was n't expecting it to be good because i never heard much about it but it was emotional and the story line was very good .
there is quick humor here and i have quickly felt like a friend . great show and i will continue to watch !
the only escape here is the end of the movie . stupid story , cheesy music and no entertainment value at all . definitely skip it .
a very heart touching love story . the movie takes place at a newer time where the book takes place at an older time .
i really enjoyed every movie in this set . it 's a great selection of film noir and definitely has a little something for everyone .
dick van dyke is one of my favorite shows of all time ! i could watch it every night , literally forever .
so bad it was funny rather than scary . maybe its because i watched a 30 year old movie . i guess it was scary when it came out .
i love holiday movies , and this one is very sweet ! a little different than the original , but still a great movie with a different twist .
old classic movie i watched when i was younger so thought my girls would like it . funny cute at the same time
got this for $ 18 and for blu ray cant pass it up for that price , quality really good , hey its blu ray
i loved it . it was informative as well as entertaining . i gave one as a gift . i would recommend this to everyone .
i have n't seen this movie in years and i just watched it again and i can definitely say that this movie was still awesome after all this time !
the sequel to the greatest movie of all time ! was so happy to purchase it and was even happier when it came in ! love it !
this is one of the best videos i seen on the study from the bible . i have taught this many times and it was don really good in the movie . it went along with the bible very close
this dvd is great , i love burn notice ... this dvd came in the original case and came before it was due .
i liked this movie very much and was glad to finally see it . i missed it in theatres and now have the complete trilogy .
great classic movie for the whole family super sound and video what a change from the old vhs and the bonus dvd shows how they did it and the cast all grown up a lot of fun
i am very pleased with my purchase . this season of csi ny is another great season . i have to say this is one of my favorite shows .
i watched this movie as a child so i had to add it to my movie collection . it really is a creative story line . you wo n't be disappointed !
she is spectacular in all three movies . i recommend getting a great drink and even popcorn and watching them all back to back .
certainly worth watching but surprised after seeing it that it won the academy award for best picture . obviously really tough subject matter and some scenes are tough to watch .
nice video ... .i really wanted to purchase the dvd and bought this by accident ... .it is nice but i wanted the dvd ... .
what an amazing show it grabs your attention and never lets it go from beginning to end . i will watch it again .
i love this movie . when i first saw it , i just had to buy it for myself .
this movie is just lame . how it won any awards is beyond me .
this is a great video , my wife and i love it . a great addition to our video library . recommend it to everyone .
it has always been one of my favorite movies since i was a kid and i finally bought it excellent movie .
superman was always my favorite superhero since i was five years old . seeing the those films on blu-ray just suprised me big time . and i love it !
i have collected the first five seasons of this show . i am a british mystery fan and this series is one of my favorites .
i am very pleased with my purchase and i will continue to use this vendor for purchases in the future . the dvd met all of my expectations . thank you !
i ordered this movie to add to my christmas movie collection and am sure i will watch it again and again .
this was a very different zombie movie , the zombies think talk and crush on girls . very different , it was cute i would watch it again .
who could not love this version of a christmas carol ? this movie is great and a must see during the holidays .
it was an ok movie but it wasnt as good as i thought it would be ... it came on time and the picture was in good shape
i like the story and the package that it came in . i would buy from seller again .
we like this movie so much we watch it all the time , it 's a nice change from the other one .
the entire movie was based on an individual obsessed with a movie . it was poorly acted and completely ridiculous . im glad that i was a prime member and didnt have to pay for this .
this is the best sitcom ever made ! ! ! laugh and cry . cry and laugh . so sweet , brilliant writing , and pure magic .
i like this show and have the first 2 seasons on dvd . i will also wait to purchase season 3 until it is n't cut .
brings back good memories of quality television programming . now add the six million dollar man to the available shows and we 'll have a perfect match .
i really liked the actor , the story lines . i generally do n't care for the southern good ole boy type plots , but this one really caught my attention . well worth the time .
i just love brad ! he did a very good job on this one . the movie was very entertaining and would recommend it to those who love fiction ... .
this was n't exactly what i thought it was going to be but got more and more into it as it progressed . i hope there is a follow up . recommended .
makes you care about each and every character . after watching a few episodes i was rooting for not only the football team but the people and their relationships .
i just love this series . it is well written and full of action . what is there not to like about this series .
i just loved this season and bought season 2 right away . the actors are great and the story line is exciting . i recommend this series .
this is a great movie . it is good for all ages . we have watched it over and over as a family .
snow white is he first disney movie i have ever watched and snow white is my favorite princess . this box set is awesome !
i bought this for my special needs daughter . she loves it . she works out to this almost everyday . easy for her to follow and keep up .
this movie is a joke . the only reason i did n't laugh was because i kept remembering the money i spent for watching it ... sad ...
air plane scene is the best . m m m m m m m m m m m m m m
i love this series i wish i would have caught it sooner i like the plot and the characters in this series . worth the watch !
i enjoyed this movie for the most part but have enjoyed reading the books more . very action packed and adventurous .
better i think then the first . but you must see the first before to keep up . loved the special effects .
the video was enjoyable when i saw it many years ago but this purchase was a birthday gift . i consider the dvd to be fluff and i purchased it for someone who enjoys lighthearted fluff .
sent this as a gift and the recipient states the product was exactly as advertised . will continue to purchase from you . thanks
very kid friendly movie , for those with kids not yet teens . this was a good family movie for all to enjoy .
loads of laughs and also violence ... i think it goes heavy on violence but lived provided much need know but the kids loved it
i think this movie is overrated . i thought it was ok but it was actually very boring at times . it is just ok for me .
very emotional and interesting especially for a story that has told sooo many times . excellent cast and performances as well !
i watched the hunger games and was pleasantly surprised with the concept of this movie . great acting and plot . excellent .
two superb performances . the dialogue is smooth and easy to get involved with . have n't seen this in years and forgot how much i liked it .
this was a happy ending love story . it was about finding true love in an unexpected time , place , situation , and person .
i liked this movie but my sister did n't . she has no children so those who understand the love of a mother probably relate to the movie better . the love of a mother ... .
i love everything about this dvd . it is exactly as i remember when i watched this as a kid , so good job guys : )
loved this show when it originally came out and now glad to share it with my kids . nice special effects with the dinosaurs and the story is interesting .
a movie that touches the heart . a must see for the entire family . there is a great need for more movies like this . keep them coming .
i found this movie to be fascinating for some reason and cruise fit right into the role . i 've watched it several times since i received it and will watch it again and again .
the first two movies were good but i was disapointed in the third movie .
i enjoyed this even more than the original movies . the casting was fantastic . i think any fan of x-men would love this movie .
you ca n't help singing along and really enjoying all the performances in this movie . after seeing it once , i had to buy it .
wonderful thriller with surprises . i also scream at certain scenes even though i 've seen this film at least 4 times .
two of the very best movies ever made in one package . belongs in every movie lover 's collection because you never know when these titles might not be available on streaming video .
it was n't a great movie , it did n't have the & # 34 ; it 's going to be a classic & # 34 ; feel to it , but it was entertaining .
i was so pleased to watch this movie . the acting was quite good and the story line was interesting . it is a very nice light-hearted film .
i love old movies and this one did not disappoint . it has a good storyline and is fast paced so not boring .
cute and funny . story line is a little weak , but the laughs gets you through the rough spots .
this was a good movie that i watched as a child . it 's good for kids , and the plot is smart and creative enough that adults wo n't be totally bored with it .
great movie . i stayed up late watching it because i was so hooked on it . definitely think you should buy one .
i buy a lot of movies that star robert de niro . i have not watched a movie that he play in that is not a good movie in my thinking .
love the show , brings back great memories and thoughts . i cant wait to order the other years . love it so
very refreshing to see something with real entertainment value . technology may have moved forward , but real entertainment goes on and on .
good old space classic to enjoy , a nice one to enjoy for something different .
a bit sappy , the family angle is good but way over done . but a better than average series if you like sci fi .
i expected the same plot and the same characters but it felt like they were trying way too hard to be funny . it was a bit much when it came to the comedy side and i was expecting funnier
this is one of my all time favorite shows . i love the way aging is presented . i really like that it is a chance to see such good acting done with such heart .
i did not enjoy the movie . my wife seems to enjoy the animation . i would not buy another similar movie .
my favorite tv show has been made into movies . what could be better than seeing the originals back again ? bravo !
walking dead season 1 was a great dvd ! i caught up on things i missed when i did not see season 1 on tv .
definitely not a show for chase fans , but rather fans who like to think . this is a really good thought provoking show .
a disney classic in every way . a movie for the whole family to enjoy , and a way for the young ones to know where a lot of the disney movies started .
this video is what my wife wanted . she has watched it once now . i gave it only 3 star because it was not my selection .
very weird no story what so ever just little girl on the run never came close to las vegas not good movie
if you are a fan of real rock music and it ' history you will love this book too . fascinating insight into three of the most important musicians in rock history .

i received the movies in good condition and on time all three movies are fabulous movies i thoroughly enjoy them i like a lot of the faith films .

it was a pleasure to see a movie about a teenager who is trying to live the right kind of life .
these movies are great sunday afternoon family viewing . throughly enjoyable , and oh so much better than anything at the movies these days . 40 times better the current remake of nancy drew .
love it , love it , love it ! ! ! this is the best written and well acted mini-series in the history of mini-series . i became obsessed with it and ca n't wait for season 4 .
this is a good story ; well written . i 've read the books and found that i like the tv series better . it can be very campy at times , but entertaining non the less .
i was looking for the new movies and did not care for the older shows . i just was not good affects very fake .
i love this movie ... in fact i believe it will always be a treasure in my home for years to come ! !
it was a good movie . a sad one but have to say did enjoy . and no doubt will watch it again .
i love this movie with its special effects , underlying moral of the story and the transition the guy makes throughout .
this is a good movie has it all violence , drama , family , life lessons on making decisions that will change your life . and it has that will make you laugh .
usually i love a lot of movies but this one not so much . i mean it is alright but it is just not the best . i honestly think disney could have done a little bit better .
i collect dvds with jennifer lawrence and this one is one of them . it is really good movie for any comic fans .
i enjoy this movie with it 's twists and turns . the movie came in a timely fashion and i have watched it . the disc is as good as advertised . thanks .
is there anyone who is n't addicted to this show . i hear there 's another season in the works . i hope it 's true !
every time i see this movie i find myself singing the songs and getting caught up with the dancing . the story line is fantastic and i catch something new everytime i watch .
i love the jesse stone series ! ! ! this is a great character and tom plays a great part ! i have all of this series and love each one !

great classic movie and many special features available for the whole family to enjoy and you got to love the blue-ray picture !
this is a great collection of episodes and even has a bonus episode in the extras . also has dvd commentary and some deleted scenes .
pretty good move , i just did n't think that it was enjoyable since i could n't relate to everything going on . the movie has great entertainment value and great music . overall a good movie .
wonderful movie . i enjoy it right along with the grandkids . cute story like and fantastic animation . i will watch it again and again .
reminds of the time when i was watching this with my mother as a kid . i just love it so much .
one of the ultimate steven seagal movies . not much shooting , more his fighting and attitude . cool fights , cars , and a few hot ladies .
this movie made no sense to me it was not what i expected because it did not have the original character that got away in it .and the story line was not very good
the first despicable movie was comical and i loved it . this second one was no disappointment . highly recommend watching this movie .
blast ! good times and fun to watch over and over again . i nice enjoyable family movie . took it to work at my office and they 've been playing it now for a week .
just when you think they will run out of material to keep the comedy fresh , they come up with something new and funny to play on . cast continues to impress with great performances ... .
great perry mason dvd . raymond burr is great as perry mason . a must have for that perry mason person in you .
we have the new version of this movie , we decided to get the first one , very interesting , and different from the new one
i was very young when then was on tv . it 's still good and i am enjoying it . i will watch john russell in anything he happens to appear .
this movie went from worst to just plain bad . even with named actors they could not carry this movie as it needed to be .
i liked it . it was mostly geared towards children , with an all animal animated cast ; but had a decent story line and a good flow .
the movie is excellent . i have n't watched it as some ... but it still very good . it arrived in excellent condition . rock hudson is terrific .
this is for my daughter 's birthday and she is going to be so surprised and excited to open this gift !
i could n't even finish this movie . it was sooo cheesy and definitely not what i expected from a movie with sean connery in it .
this is one harry potter movie i had never seen . i enjoyed it although it is not my favorite of the series .
good premise . the suspense kept building . it was recommended to me , and i in turn would recommend it as well .
i did n't like it at all . i did not like the plot . it was very confusing . it was too gory
interesting plots and great characters . the costuming and small historical references are fun . we call it a & # 34 ; murdoch night & # 34 ; when we 've had a tough day .
timothy olyphant never disappoints with his acting , and the movie was pretty entertaining as well . if you like the walking dead , you 'll probably like this movie .
i love this movie . its easy to watch and follow along , funny , and right balance between action and comedy . /
it was a little difficult to follow at first , but when it all comes together ( and it will come together for people at different times throughout the movie ) it is really fabulous .
i just recently bought this dvd ! i died laughing . fun for the whole family to enjoy !
all i can say is , it is about time that this classic was on dvd . my all time favorite !
what more movies should be like today , funny , heartwarming and uplifting as well as entertaining . i have seen it at least 10 times .
this dvd was worth the price i had to pay , because they never show it on tv . excellent movie .
i feel this is one of the most creative and moving stories i have ever seen , inside the trek series and outside ! done to perfection .
this movie is a must see . it 's almost tradition to watch this every christmas . rent it or buy it you wo n't regret it .
this movie is one of the best , i love the fight scenes . i also love the way he can drive a car .
one of our favorite movies . great cast with excellent acting abilities . would want the dvd to be in their own language with english subtitles . do so look forward to the day it is finally released !
we love the mib movies and this is going to be fun to watch with our children . excited about mib iii
this is easily the best star trek spoof ever ! ! the special effects are amazing . i cant wait for their next film .
it was good i just wish it had a lil bit more detail i guess i was expecting a lil better ending .
this is an old movie . no , it is not perfect , but it is one of the better ones . a must have for your home bible movie collection .
it was a very good movie & i enjoyed it & it was so funny that i watched it several times .

this is a really cool movie . we all enjoy watching it a real family film - recommend it to anyone who loves a feel good drama
i saw this in the theatres , and loved every minute of it . i am happy to add it to my collection .
this is one of the great movies that was made in the 60 's . you will want to watch it over and over .
the subject matter is of great interest , so i probably would have been curious and wanting to watch no matter what , but this was a well-done film .
is so fascinating to believe that we can be around this creatures , is only fiction but still is something to dream about
a long and epic movie . i watched it a few times until i passed it along to my daughter . it is a very good - and long - epic movie .
this was such a cool cartoon when i was younger it brought back good times of the show .
i saw this movie in the theater and loved it . i told my husband after that i was going to buy it when it came out on dvd . still love it , such a cute movie !
i was turned on to this movie years ago and it became my instant favorite from time on . i love the british humor and all of the characters . they make me smile every time i watch it .
my 18 month old loves to watch arthur on pbs , so this was a lot of fun for her & # 8230 ; and me !
love this series . great plot and keeps your interest . i have watched it from the beginning and recommend to everyone .
i already owned season one but had to order a second set after one of the dvds became defective ( after years of use ) . i highly recommend this series with a great ensemble cast and exceptional humor .
why would you ask for my opinion when i have not even received the movie as yet . i have not seen it so can not rate it .
one of my new favorite movies . quirky story , excellent cast and very touching underlying love story . excellent for a date at home !
received as ordered . very funny . this is my husbands favorite film staring bob hope . is good fun for the whole family .
another winning horse movie . one of the best . this one kept me on the edge of my seat and touched my heart .
cute . fun . but the ending is unrealistic . it was a chick flick to be sure , but a lot of fun . i just could n't buy the ending .
love this show , has drama with a hint of comedy and some gore in it . great cast that makes the show worth watching
i would recommend this to anyone over the age of 18 years it is not suitable for young children it is very graphic
the only disappoint in this set is that there were so few episodes . i think there were two discs and 8 episodes . cost per episode was a bit higher than usual for the series .
the best in suspense and mystery . very intelligent writing and brilliant acting ! keeps you on the edge of your seat .
great movies we watch all the halloween movies and this one has you on the edge of your seat , i recommend it highly if your are a halloween movies fan
this movie is really quirky and fun . to see the character develop and deal with the real life problems was funny and entertaining .
excellent character and plot development ! watch one or two episodes and you will be completely hooked ! real mob & # 34 ; looking & # 34 ; players ... easy plot to believe !
lots of tragedy but so is life ... i am enjoying the life journey of this series ... so much class and well acted .
it is a good movie but not quite a 5 star to me , did enjoy it and sure others will and do also , just added to my collection
another john wayne movie for my collection . i have always enjoyed robert mitchum . the two actors make a good pair .
i just got it in the mail . but i have not watched it yet . but i will soon . i seen this movie when i was a kid and i loved it .
this is one of the best adventure movies of all time . filled with thrills and awesome cg affects that make it seem like your in middle earth yourself ! ! !
i absolutely love everything about this movie . it 's just so intriguing to me . it makes me want to go back and live in the great depression . strange . i know .
elements of a mystery , powerful storyline , great acting and in a time period that we all identify with as emotional .
a well put together story in the continuation of the thor saga and love story .
action movie and you know that action will be in the next scene . by the end you do not care ,
i enjoy this movie . fun music and has a good message for children . love the characters ! good cute humor . i can watch this more then once and not get sick of it .
this is just as good as the original . that 's not always the case . this is a great chic flick and honestly you should own both versions ! for the price you ca n't beat it !

one of the best of the best . just the right amount of comedy mixed with tragedy and done by fine actors .
just got this in the mail and of course it is in great condition , i absolutely love this movie , i definitely recommend you purchase stuff from this seller : )
started out very slow and almost turned it off , but then it picked up a little so i decided to watch the entire thing .
i have been watching movies all these weeks because i am sick and i thought maybe these two good artists will keep me entertained but the movie made me tired .
fun movie just loved it and any one with small or teenagers with will love this movie so funny sweet
a quirky and fun movie . definitely entertaining . solid performances by all . we enjoyed it very much . you wo n't regret seeing it .
i put off a long time in watching this movie and i 'm sorry i did i loved it a tear jerker some parts but a great movie and cast ... great for a collection ...
i watched this late at night and was pleasantly suprised that i actually enjoyed it . nice movie if you are into the type of material presented .
totally loved this film , it 's an eye opener . leonardo dicaprio did a great job and i loved all the interviews . 2 thumbs up .
i thought it would be better than it was . its ok but not great . bought it for my grandson but he didnt even sit through the whole movie . he didnt like it .
the only reason i have this 4 stars and not 5 is because most of the extras are n't in hd . but the feature films themselves are unbelievable !
best movie ever . will recommend to others . this was given to my brother as a gift which he loved it .
i looked for this movie for awhile , and am happy i found it ! to me this movie is fun to watch !
such a funny movie . love all the characters ! ! michael caine is just to funny for words . if you are down this will bring you up for sure . delightful !
this movie has interesting characters and a good story line . i would highly recommend this movie . we love the dragons .
i 'm not a big fan of tom c. but i love him as a bad guy in this movie . : )
i absolutely love star wars ! ! i have been waiting til they go on sale and finally bought them ! cant wait to watch them
it was a good movie , i would have paid to see it in the theater . it was nice to see a different take on a story that has been around as long as snow white .
this was extremely bad . could not believe what i was seeing . it was poorly filmed and just plain bad . i do not suggest
my favorite ! keep the episodes coming and we 'll be sure to watch ! you have to love & # 34 ; early & # 34 ; !
kind of a mash up of movies . was like men in black only with ghosts , but saw a lot of familiar elements that reminded me of other movies . but it was entertaining and pretty clean .
at the same time ordering the 2nd season i ordered the third my husband is really enjoying this series thanks again .
ca n't get enough of the current sherlock - truly brilliant adaptation . although there are only 3 episodes , they are each 1 1/2 hours long .
i have truly loved all the downton abbey series . all of the actors are so good . can hardly wait until the next one comes out ! ! ! !
i found out about this show on the pbs website and was happy to find it on amazon prime . the actors do a good job and has a well written plot .
excellent cartoon for boys and girls alike . well drawn , inventive plots and memorable characters .
debbie reynolds , singing and dancing ... who could ask for anything better ! wonderful family musical . i would recommend this to anyone looking for a fun , family , musical .
classic movies are still the best ! this movie covered a period of history . it was extremely well acted , the story line was brilliant .
good story , very funny and family friendly , i will recommend anyone who like to watch morning show or harrison ford to have this movie in their collection .
nowhere near as good as the first three . if they are going to use ( the bourne ) as part of the name of the movie they need to do better than that .
all i have to say is great . i could watch these movies all the time . and i have watched it a few times .
this is a great movie and is part of my christmas collection that i watch every year . great family movie .
had n't seen this since i was a kid . still a great movie , but a little long . worth a watch if you want a lazy sunday afternoon !
this was a great story . great story line , great acting by all . everyone loved it and we watched it many a time . would highly recommend this one .
it was a good movie and although i enjoyed it , the first was a much better story line than this .
a few moments of laughter but not as good as i thought it was going to be ; worth to watch once and maybe again in 2 years
this was given as a gift to my son . i hope he likes it , but i have no idea what it is like .
3 year old loves this movie . she has watched both of them 5 times since we got the movies . thanks
this too was a purchase for a grandson . he loves the game and everything he can read or see about it . i watched this with him and it was a fun story .
do it do it has to be my favorite part ! not an oscar winner or anything but definitely a fun campy movie
i mainly bought this movie because i have seen it previously and also because my whole family is a fan of adam sandler movies . very , very funny movie .
that brief period where science fiction meets humor . something with the old drive in theater . but there was absolutely no disappointment . i 'm still looking for other classics i remember as a child .
its really sad when the best thing about this movie is 5 amazing actors taking off their clothes . but the story like kinda sucked , and it left you hanging when mike just left ...
love this movie . oldie but goodie . pure enjoyment . totally to be viewed for a fun night . will not be disappointed .
i bought this video for my 2 year old who loves elmo ... it has little to do with the true meaning of christmas and the plot becomes repetitive ... terrible dvd or video
if you like the cast , it is a great shoot em up , not much of a story line tho , but good for this type of film .
so much better than the first and being that the first was so incredible , that is saying a lot . this one will make ya scream out loud and then laugh about it afterwards .
i did n't think this movie was that great . i give it two stars because i enjoy both the main characters , but other than that it was not worth seeing .
this movie is a classic ! i enjoyed hearing all those wonderful songs . the performances were stellar ! i would watch this over & over again .
this maybe a first , a combo of three movies on three discs that are all relatively good together . good buy for the customer and saves space in the process .
i did n't care to keep watching around the hour mark , but i wanted to know what happened . it 's a funny concept , but does n't deliver the laughs .
i thoroughly enjoyed this movie , its a kids movie that adults can enjoy as well . i highly recommend it to anyone who likes pixar movies .
not what i expected . acting was n't up to par and the story line put us to sleep . no thank you
very good movie . it will keep you guessing and on the edge of your seat .
wonderful story that continues on . disney has done it again . need more stories like this to be available for young ladies to see .
not the best movie ever but not the worse either it did help me kill sometime . but there are defiantly better movies to see , but ok if you want to kill some time .
watched most of these years ago and was not disappointed viewing them again , he always made movies with good content .
this is an awesome movie and fun for all ages , bought as a christmas gift for my adult son . enjoy it
heart felt and moving film based on a true story . well worth an evenings rental . a must see film for the family .
i saw this movie in theaters , and i thought it was adorable ! the music is fantastic , and there were a lot of lines in there to make parents laugh , as well as children .
love the program ... love the actors . i will some day own all the seasons . i love this kind of entertainment as i 'm going to bed .
well i thought this movie was bad . the special effects were sooo bad they made you laugh . but it was very violent and the language was high which i thought would be r rating
great group of actors , great scripts & directing ( what more can anyone ask ? ) -- will continue to buy any more that come out on the market !
bought this to replace a missing season of my collection . content rocks and quality of dvd 's are good overall too .
i had already seen this movie and liked it and the the reason i bought it . i 'm in the market for all kinds of old movies , so keep offering what ever you have . thank you !
johnny depp is so great in this movie . he does a great job and this is just a great watch for any age
not bad for a free amazon prime instant video , it held my attention with it 's very unique format , and shows that it is possible to make an entertaining film on a low budget .
this play was great but you better sit down and have nothing else to do to watch it because its one of the long ones . still loved it though .
if you do n't have this movie , buy it and give it a watch . you wo n't be disappointed .
it is not the greatest in terms of filming , but the acting is good and for what they could do , they did well . of course , the book is excellent . another rainy day movie fix !
great chemistry in this movie and very believable ! loved it almost as much as the first one ! ! ! very romantic and beautiful city for background !
i brought this movie for a friends son and i heard he watches it every night before he goes to bed .
i enjoyed every minute of it . it was a very clever movie and well done . just when i thought i had figured it out , it would take a turn in another direction .
i love the office . i saw every episode and am very excited to have the dvd 's so i can watch them whenever i want .
what 's there to not like about doris day . anything she did was worth watching and she always had good leading men to work with .
i had heard so much about this movie i just had to see it for myself . it 's so funny . parts of it are slow but it 's a great movie overall .
i enjoy this type of movie and i was told it was not very good but i have watched this movie 6 times now .
makes you want to think ! still why the kids ? these type of movies make you think people around you are scared .
i more or less grew up on & # 34 ; secret agent man & # 34 ; , and now i get to see the first seasons that started it all .
i thought that this was a good movie . it was n't the best ive seen but over all it was good .
five stars for this type of movie . everything i expected it to be . would recommend to others that like this type of film .
i loved this movie very much for the real life situations and great acting . i highly recommend it . superb movie !
this is a good movie and i would request it to my friends . i was pleased with everything about it
big bang theory is still amazingly funny and its on its 6 season . i love this show and is even better on blu ray nothing to complain about .
this movie was very good , kevin and supporting cast make a great effort to make this movie and it worked , will not win anything , but worth watching .
i love this movie , so glad to have it in blu-ray ! ! my daughter and i enjoy watching al the disney movies together !
i enjoyed every show maybe we will get lucky some one will make more star trek shows i hope this helps
this will be watched many times in our house . it 's really cute and has a great reminder / lesson for grown ups . good for kids of all ages - i would suggest 4 and up .
this is a great movie for everyone to enjoy . there 's a sequel coming out soon , i hope it 's as good as this one !
this was a very good movie ! it has plenty of action and drama ! it is a good family movie also ! i enjoyed it very much !
i really like this movie . i have enjoyed watching it with my daughter many , many times . it 's kinda sad in certain parts but all ends well .
so glad this is finally out . great show . lots of fun ! someone at warner finally grew a brain ! thanks so much !
i love all the twilight movies . good acting for the cast . this movie was excellent . you wo n't regret buying it for your collection .
this has slightly cheesy effects since it is from the 90 's , but its still great and well done in my opinion
easy syfy movie to follow the story was great the acting was great and the surprise ended unexpected . do n't know who that kid is but i hope he sticks to acting .
exceptional and the streaming quality was fantastic . this was a superb movie in he fast and furious sequels . i was impressed also with how smooth the streaming was .
this was a typical bond movie . it had alot of action . the plot was somewhat convoluted , but worth watching . i would reccomend watching .
the first time i watched this dvd , i laughed so hard that i was crying ! ! richard pryor was a comic genius ! ! ! !
fabulous acting and a wonderful movie . this was exceptional ! the story line was just wonderful and i was enthralled by this movie . m loved it !
the movie is almost an entire video of laughter . even though it was filmed about 30 years it 's still a good movie .
they kill lots of witches in this movie but they also kind of missed the mark . i guess if there is nothing else on , then i would watch this movie , but really only once .
i have had the original vhs copy . then i just had to have it on dvd . was hoping it would come out in blu-ray soon .
the movie was very good . a little long but keep you interested in it . everyone should buy & watch this movie .
the movie was long and slow . my brother and i fell asleep through most of it . i 'm glad i did n't go to the theater to watch it .
i loved this series when it was first on tv and i still do , even more so . great character interaction .
this is my favorite paul newman movie and one of my favorite movies of all time . paul was a clever character and he provided great entertainment to all who watch this movie .
had previously watched this series , and loved it . had to have it for my dvd collection . always get top quality ordering new or used .
this was good mindless entertainment . i enjoyed the special effects . the actors did a good job . i was entertained and would watch it again .
what a stupid plot , what a stupid movie and shame on russell crowe for taking the part . he must have needed the money .
this has always been a good movie to watch . there are some movies we watch all the time and this is one of them .
week story line , could not hold my attention , so i lost why i was watching the movie . the switch from real to animation was done very badly .
i read the book and i 've watched this movie several times . i enjoy it more each time i view it !
i watched pooh with my sons , and now with my grand son , you just ca n't go wrong with pooh . who ca n't fall in love with the friends at pooh corner ?
not as good as the 1st but , it was filmed 10 years later . so i still liked it . i 'm a huge fan of mib movies . : d
we rented pi over the holiday , we wanted a family movie we could enjoy . we all found that pi deserved the academy awards earned recently . we really enjoyed it .
loved the short film that angela robinson created - the full film version was interesting and entertaining . i was laughing through most of it . its a spoof of spy films and is hilarious .
a nice movie for a family movie night ... not something you 're going to watch over and over , but a good evening 's entertainment .
one of the best superhero movies ever made ! epic ! i loved ever minute of this movie . watch it two times at the movies . a classic !
love it that a girl is so brilliant in this movie . great actors , really fast paced , blow your mind action . the end is so unexpected . got ta get this movie !
i thought it was another tv show i watched as a kid but it was n't . the series was ok. i would n't recommend it .
she jumped for joy ! had seen it before , was on her list for christmas ... she already had the first mermaid tale .
i love the series naruto but i usually get it at best buy but their prices are so high as of late but this was a great deal
if you are a harry potter fan , this is another great movie to add to your collection .
we like jason statham movies and we were not disappointed . he and robert deniro were great in this ! it really keeps your interest up with the way no one is what they seem !
best of the series with a well developed story with parts 1 and 2 and 4 hours to make the story better .
i bought this for a gift and did not see the person to give it to them so i can not tell you what the movie is about .
an adorable movie with great music and the marvelous danny kaye . it does show it 's age though . watch it with a child .
the movie is enlightening and showing how things were back in those days . i really enjoyed it . no complaints here .
kind of like `` mad max '' in space . a sci-fi b movie but i find it entertaining . ( but then i like sci fi b movies )
story line was good and action not so bad but not the greatest . something to watch in simple night or day .
suspense , drama , action , and eye catching . full of i ca n't leave the tv scenes because you are scared of missing something , but ca n't figure out which was better 1 or 2
the 5th season is great . i ca n't wait to see season 6 if i can find it at a reasonable price .
i saw the trailer 's for this movie and it was a great movie that i added to my collection . it did arrive earlier that expected
i loved this movie when i was a kid , and i got it so quickly that i watched it the same day it was received .
watched this movie on television , went out the next day , bought this film . it 's simply a fun and wonderful story . your dvd library needs this one !
if you want to laugh watch this movie . i 've seen it a couple of times with different friends ! ! give it a try !
the item showed up nice and fast as well as the price was good , in the end it turned out to be 5 movies , one of the disks has 2 movies on it , bonus , thanks .
not the best effort by lancaster . the movie looked like it was made for tv , and lacked the punch it should have had .
i was glad to see dexter get closer to being the dexter of earlier seasons . one of the best series out there .
the bluray came as packaged and the quality of it was perfect . the movie , on the other hand , was alright . but the quality of the product was perfect .
this series is another which is on top of my must have list . great action , and humor , ca n't ask for a better cast .
i love this anime and it definitely meet my expectations i watched it twice when i first got it and it was good quality
i can not add anything to what has been said before , just wanted to put my five star rating on this film as well as this release .
i am crazy about this movie , it was very well made , it does n't hurt to like some of the players , i watch this over and over .
this is a fun movie to watch with the family . it is funny , clever , and creative . grab some popcorn kick back and enjoy !
acting was good , but i was disappointed by the movie overall . i 'm not even sure why . would not recommend this movie..
i like robert duvall in anything . he always seems , especially in westerns to give the viewers a taste of what the old west was really like .
criterion as always does an excellent job with this movie . and this is the best version to get . highly recommend !
ca n't really say much more . dumb story , bad acting , the kind that does n't make a movie badly good .
love this series . always loved medical shows and this is one of the best .
gary moore if you have n't already heard him play , is a great guitar player . if you like guitar i suggest this on blu-ray ! ! ! !
i have already recommended it to a few friends who love romantic comedy . de niro was great ! i love that it was n't all about the younger people .
never heard of this movie , my daughter told me about it . i purchased it for her , we watched it together , i loved it ! !
a real classic chick flick . such a great movie that all women should watch . i would absolutely recommend this movie .
not quite what i expected . it was a good movie . love the color . story line was good . just was n't my type of movie .
it had been yrs since i had seen this and was interesting to see again and share with others who had view before also
i watched the first season and enjoyed it very much . i plan to watch the other two as well . excellent .
this was typical film about one man 's struggle against many forces of evil . you 've seen it all many times before . this one perhaps a tad above average for this type of storyline .
glad i found it and ca n't wait to watch it with my brother on our next movie date fun fun
this is one of the best videos i 've ever seen for children . my grandchildren love seeing this over and over again .
one of the better gay films in recent years . great script , acting and directing . a very moving film a must see
this is a great program . well done and interesting . i learned a lot by watching it , and it has had a positive effect on my life .
pretty much all his movies are great and of consistent quality . i actually have n't seen some of these , so looking forward to that .
great movie . very funny & the research seems to follow very true to the era ... we love it !
if you like listening to queen , the you need this dvd . freddy may be gone , but this dvd will bring him back . the video quality is good and the song selection is good .
this is the fifth one we have gotten , some as gifts and my husband is hooked on old westerns from his childhood
most awesome cast . a wonderful story line , beautiful setting . a really awesome movie . love it & will watch it again for sure .
you get two for your money ; and they are well worth watching . kids would enjoy these too . anyone who likes adventure films should like these .
i have seen this movie many times and wanted to have a copy in my personal library so that i may watch it whenever i 'd like . it is a very good movie .
while i was bored to tears watching the video my grandaughter ( 10 ) seems to enjoy dancing along to it . most of the lessons are for adults and complicated but she does seem to have fun .
i bought this as a gift for my dad , but i remember it from when i was a kid and it was a riot . i remember hearing my dad laugh so loud at it .
the movie lets you think one way and then you find it taking you on a totally different journey , very interesting .
i like tom hanks was kind a different movie for him . was not real excited about it . was okay but you kind a got lost if you missed any moment of it .
this is a funny classic . i purchased it to watch with a few friends . thanks to this site i was able to purchase it for a very low price and it was shipped very quickly .
great movie , great action , well done . it will put you on the seat of your chair watching it . very interesting movie .
classic arnold . worth the cost of the rental . plenty of action and funny at the same time . worth the rental .
not quite my cup of tea but my sister loved it . no real edgy stuff but a fun watch . maybe a good family film .
i have seen this move perhaps 6 times and i will probably see it again . elizabeth and rock at their best .
this was a very good movie with good acting and a good story . i would recommend this movie to my family and friends .
movie was ok but i 'm not a fan of the alien series anyway . but i guess it was interesting none the less .
at moments it 's a little difficult to understand because it 's a dream over a dream ... i need to see it again , i did n't understand the final part ...
when will the dvd of this great film be released ? ! the performances ... amazing . a real look at gay life at that time ... a time that seems so long ago : ( !
it great show i have watch every time it on love all they in the show it funny and great to watch
nothing more to say but i enjoyed the program very much and will probably not do any more ratings because i feel forced to say something when the stars say it all for me .
it was funny and touching at the same time . josh d is superb eye candy . predictable , but worth my time .
a gift for my husband . he loves old musicals so will be looking forward to watching it when the holiday rush is over .
excellent 3d , one of the best i 've seen . i have over 60 3d movies and this is one of the best !
this was quite the most interesting of halle berry 's movie with the sex scenes and such . it was just okay for me .
my grandson loves this movie and now i need to purchase 3 for him . im so glad i can go back and forward to buy any movies i need for my family and myself ... .
when i saw this as a kid i really did not get it , now that i am older i think it is a real comedy classic .
this was a decent movie and crazy how it was based on actual events . an older but alright movie . not bad .
my grandpa was so happy when he opened this for his birthday yesterday . it arrived right on time , and his face was so worth it !
well acted , great script . people who know big business and the stock market will like this . it was over my head , but the basic plot line was interesting .
great acting , great directing , great story : what more could you ask for . blood and violence is not what i enjoy in today 's movies
this is a very funny movie . these two have great comedic appeal . this is one of our classic go to movies when we want to laugh .
i love the madea movies , but this one less of her , the main character , i would have liked to have seen more of madea in this dvd !
this was boring and the story was not put together well . i was rooting for the bad guys just for this to be over .
although this is a kids movie i found it very fun to watch . it had great laughs and a good story line .
happy to find this on amazon . all episodes are playing fine so far . there are many episodes on each disk so this was definitely worth the money ! reasonable price for this set .
thank you family enjoyed movie . accurate in description and in perfect condition great price . have shared with friends to enjoy as well . and purchase another for my grandson
the setting is interesting , the story is good and the subject is important . however the movie as a whole i found boring . but should have known that from the title : lots of talking .
i really in joy watching that show on tv now i have the complete collection to watch
this is a great and hilarious movie adaptation of the phenomenal tv show . great actors and just fantastic writing that really kept true .
better than the first one as the story line seemed more complete . still it needs a little something to be a great movie .
just what i needed . glad i 'm not the only one buying this but it was worth it . i use it several times a week now .
great family movie , for all ages , had a great story line . disney just keeps getting better with their movies . wonderful ! ! !
i enjoyed this series very much and i am looking forward to the next season . i hope it will be on prime very soon .
dark and disturbing with lots of the usual violence , but i like the stories , so wanted to own the set .
this is an awesome and very sad movie . cameron diaz was great in this movie . excellent to watch but not often .
i was very happy with my movie- it was in great condition , and delivery was prompt . i 'm truly enjoying it -
always will be one of my favorite shows . the characters all work so well together and make for great tv .
we have watched this movie several times although we 've only had it for a few months . great action , thrilling story . happy to add it to our alien series .
i do n't know how maggie smith got into this . just not my genre ! not funny , not entertaining , not suspense , just boring .
a fun movie that plays with the idea of time travel and the consequences . quite imaginative and interesting . engrossing from beginning to the end .
this is a great movie that my family and i enjoy watching every year ! if you are looking for good family entertainment at christmas time , this is it !
had some funny parts but overall was just too nasty with their language and everything for it to be considered a great movie .
veggie tales delivers again as the kids love these movies . it 's great that they come out with different ones so the kids can learn different things about life and god !
i got this for mothers day too and my mom loved it like i do , it 's a very good movie .
not much to say here , it 's a disney movie , but at the same time it 's not a disney movie , if that makes any sense . definitely worth watching
move of all time . i never get tired of the comedy in this movie . even have my kids watching with me whenever i put it on . great buy .
i really dig this movie . i am a huge fan of far out love stories and this is surely on of the most far out .
this is an incredible ballet workout , i find myself doing this one the most . it really deliver results ! a really nice change from high impact but dont let that fool ya ! you will get results !
i really enjoyed this movie ! it was full of action and suspense and the ending was pretty cool . i would recommend this move for any who like suspense and horror
loved the movie and loved the 3d . a must have for any one building a 3d blu ray library at home .
80 's tech , 80 's style and great actors . the story was well written and even the sequel in this set was good .
one of my favorite movies ever . cant believe its on blu ray . obviously not as sharp as a modern movie but the best transfer available right now
love the show . it is too bad it is not on any more , i would like to see this continue .
i like all of tyler perry 's work so of course i 'm going to buy these . and their really funny , too .
excellent , one of the best musicals ever made . the cast is terrific and they all did their own singing .
i ca n't wait until another one comes out , i love his movies . this was very well time spent and money
my son is a true shark fanatic and this was as good as gold for him . he loved and will watch it over and over guaranteed ! ! ! !
i loved the lost series and could n't wait to watch it every week . i was disappointed with the final episode of the final season .
tyler perry has done it again ! hilarious movie ! ! i could watch it over and over again and still laugh just as hard as i did the first time ! ! !
loved watching the hbo series dead wood with timothy olyphant . was very pleased to discover the justified series as it too is excellent written and produced .
that 's about all i can say about this `` new '' set . if you do n't own any of them yet , i can see getting this set , but other than that ? ? ?
i think this is a great movie . i teach fourth grade . we read the book and then watch the movie for comparison . the students love the book and the movie .
they do n't get any better than this if you love westerns , adventures , period movies , well you name it . do n't even think about it any longer , buy a copy of this great flick
this is a fantastic historical drama . the writing , acting , and attention to detail for scenery and costume are all outstanding .
not bad at all . it keeps you wondering who it was until the conclusion . some cheese but not much .
tarantino does n't have even half the creativity and originality the director of this movie had . this british production is very good , you care about the characters .
i love this story - the characters are perfectly cast and the story is everything one would expect from a masterpiece theater presentation . i ca n't wait for season 4 .
i 'm going to love this new season . i so much enjoyed the other 2 and have watched them more than once .
did not get to watch this before . love al pacino . thrilled with purchase . hard to find pacino movies in stores .
this is one of the few movies in which norris does a good job of acting .
laughed the whole way through the movie in the theater so just had to have it in the collection for the house !
was a good movie with lots of action and it was very entertaining with lot of suspense to it . i would recommend the movie .
i watched this on the hallmark channel the first time and have seen it several times and when i saw it on amazon i purchased it .
i have n't seen this since i was younger and i enjoy this movie very much . you made it possible for me to own this awesome movie .
this i have from sometime ago an excellent movie it is here on my shelf dvd and vhs cant remember when ordered thank you
another one of our holiday favorites , we will now be able to watch year round . this is a fantastic family film with great values .
my daughter likes this movie but it is not one of her favorites . she likes the first one better .
this will be another great series . not quite as great as the lord of the rings , but a good series none the less .
i 'm a fan so of course i had to buy this why else would n't i ? ! but besides that i think its a really cool show very imaginative : )
glad to find this very entertaining old movie on dvd and much enjoyed since . it came in excellent condition and in a timely manner .
i love this show . i think my husband and i watched all the episodes within three days . will watch again .
i 'm not a race car fan but really enjoyed this movie . like the way they brought some behind the driving pieces out .
this is a workout i always use . i just hope there will be a dvd format for this program before my vhs wear out .
the order was received in only 3 days . thank you for your speedy service . i will definately choose you again . thank you .
possibly the best season of any t.v . show that ever was and ever will be . i love it . that is all .
hello world , well written decent acting and nice effects . good amount of gore and atmosphere the story is decent and creepy as hell . dont bring this one to christmas dinner !
great for christmas ! ! ! ! my grandson loves it and it is pleasant to watch for and old , old man like me !
this is a train documentary featuring johnny cash filmed in the 70 's . no concert or concert footage here . johnny cash talks about the evolution of trains and sings some train songs along the way .
this show has adventure , laughs , romance , and it makes you think ! there is lots there for everyone ! i have really enjoyed it !
enjoyed this tv show a lot . hoping to see more of these interesting ladies and good story lines . i hope there will be more seasons to come .
great movie i definitely recommend it and you can watch it without watching the actual show and still understand it which is great .
another wonderful 80s movie i think im gon na go back in time and live in the 80s life was so much easier ! ! ! love this film ! ! !
i simply love this series . only ones that can compare to it are revenge and fringe . each season just seems to get better and better .
glenn ford is one of my all time fav stars . this was one of his best movies ! great entertainment , clean fun , funny !
garfield is the greatest cat . my 3 year old wore out her other copy , so i got this one to replace it .
every bit as good as the book . i look forward to the next movie and i will be adding it to my video library .
second time to see this movie . enjoyed it because of the unusual plot , but nevertheless it was an old movie .
not the best but decent for a one time watch with the kids or family . kind of boring to me however .
i literally watched this back to back . loved it from begining to end . the animation and story are great . my family thoroughly enjoyed this .
another great movie of action and great actors . wonderful twist at the end . a must have for any dvd collection
jeff dunham 's dvd 's are great , i have 6 so far , they keep you laughing . it only took a few days to get to me
having been a huge fan of star trek from its first days on tv , this movie is a fantastic addition to the journey and well worthy of the series .
i really enjoyed this movie . i 'm at the beach every chance i get , so this was a home run for me . the story was great and the scenery was amazing . fun movie
my husband ordered this and he loved it . i usually do not like this kind of film but to my surprise i enjoyed it also . received quickly . in condition as stated .
one of my favorite movies ever and my very favorite christmas movie . the cast is superb and they all seem to be having a good time . you just ca n't help but feel good after watching .
a thoroughly enjoyable series . sorry that it only lasted one season . the characters are quirky and fun . the stories are very imaginative .
i 'm basically just writing this to give the movie one star and hopefully save some people from such a tragic loss of time .
one of the most frightening movies i have ever seen . not for the faint of heart . i would see it again .
what a great concept . to put four wonderful classic movies in one package is absolutely terrific . item came in great condition and promptly .
did n't like the vulgar language right off the bat and every other word . hard to see ben like that too
this makes a nice compliment to my collection of early frankenstein movies . these movies are digitally enhanced and very clear .
good movie got it for my brother as a birthday gift and he liked it . nice movie overall to go along with the first one .
i liked this dvd very much . good action , and a good buy too . this is a great site to shop and i will keep buying from it .
this is ncis at its best ! ca n't wait to see what comes next ! seems like each season is better than the previous one !
this movie was very interesting and a good & # 34 ; who did it ? & # 34 ; type movie . denzel washington always good acting . this will keep you guessing until the end .
i love this sweet romantic movie . it 's a magical christmas movie that 's great for families . it 's one of our favorite christmas time movies .
different but great movie , not as good as the original wizard of oz , but then what would be ? but still worth watching .
i just did n't enjoy this movie i thought it was slow and storyline was predictable . i would not recommend this movie to friends .
oh yes , this is the africa i remember of my childhood and youth - well acted and of course , magnificent scenery
if you have n't honestly seen this yet buy the movie now call in sick to work and get some popcorn !
this one of my favorite dvd i remember seeing this when i was young this a true classic in my book one of the best
really enjoying this series . the characters are all growing up and changing this season , including the adults , and that 's a good thing .
if you have not seen this one what are you waiting for superb acting and i could n't stop laughing , & # 34 ; you got to see the dude & # 34 ;
this show reminds me of when i was little and it is filled with great humor and feeling ! i recommend getting it ! it came on time and was in great condition !
i had heard of this movie from die hard horror fans for years . this film lived up to expectations and is a solid , classic , film .
this is an excellent movie that could not be found until now . so if you want a perfect performance and an unusual story line this movie is for you .
poor story line . the movie was carried with excellent acting by some characters . something was definitely lacking here . i would not rent it again .
it was ok not as good as the other ones but good to watch would recommend it to any one .
kevin spacey is so believeable and loveable . i can watch this movie over and over .
it was a good christmas movie . i enjoyed it very much . i will watch it next christmas and new year .
this movie is the top pick by all my grandkids ( 13 ) as one of their favorites ! !
i really liked this movie but i had to watch it a couple times to like it . the filming is a little dark and it took me a couple times to warm up to it .
watched this movie and immediately ordered the book it was based on . there are two other books that follow it also . very good movie . definitely gives us something to think about .
a great movie from start to finish , with great acting , photography , and an outstanding score !
i have all the cds to this series and my children watch it again and again . this is a fun family show and we enjoy watching it
i love this tv series . season three is just as good as one and two . i look forward to season four .
you could see how this could happen . love is good , sad , and funny . this is all three . jennifer aniston and jason bateman both play good parts ,
i really liked this movie . it was funny and yet it still made ya tear up . interesting premise ... made me think about what i would do in that situation .
this movie is going to suck , just like people who write reviews of movies they have n't seen yet .
it was great from the start to the end . i wish they made movies like that now . but they do not .
for a 70 's movie it was not bad to watch for a retro movie
if you have n't seen this movie you 're really missing out its really funny and different its really a must see !
i enjoy this movie . i had my husband watch it for the first time and he enjoyed it as well .
i watched this movie when it first came out on tv . i purchased a copy for me and my boys . we like suspenseful and scary movies ! !
i have watched this movie for years and still watch it every christmas . it 's a classic and well acted . it 's one of my favorite christmas movies .
the best way to own this is on blu-ray ! the memories this brings are well worth owning it , and it gives me something to share with my family .
this is an underrated movie . very cute , some action , some romance , loveable characters ... what 's not to like ? ! so glad this was available through my favorite online store !
this movie makes 3d great and also the bluray is wonderfully done . highly recommend this movie as a reference of all others to compare !
i was pleasantly surprised with this one . mother kept me interested from the start to the end . the acting from the lead character was really believable . i enjoyed this one and recommend it .
i must say , it 's my least favorite of the series of iron man . i liked the first and second one much much more .
definitely worth the price ! three dvds for what you 'd normally pay for one in the store . any serious doctor who collector must have these stories !
actually i do n't love it , but my sister does , she is absolutely happy ! is great . she watch it every day .
i do n't know what she thought of it , we do n't speak any more but i have seen it on tv and like it just fine
we originally rented this movie through netflix and liked it so much , we bought it here . great story , superb acting .
it starts as a family drama and ends as a greek tragedy in between it is well worth watching . great story with great characters .
i really enjoyed the show . there are always twists and turns i never expect to keep me on my toes .
nothing great , but was something to watch , i thought it would be better then it was but why not watch it
i had rented this movie and ended up buying it and the book because i liked it that much . you do n't know what or when something going to happen to you in life .
one of the best horror movies i have seen since dead alive . a must see for cult horror movie fans .
i know this got rave reviews , but i was n't a huge fan . bullock is great in it , but the movie itself was n't good .
this movie had its funny moments but was not as good as the original .
very interesting movie . i totally enjoyed it . i would recommend it to all .
my mom had given me this for christmas , and once we watched it , she wanted it for herself . so she 's getting it this coming christmas .
they just turned 20 and i only recently discovered them while in england and loved em ! had to get the video in usa format !
i was very excited to see this . it is well done , with an all-star japanese cast . it is very faithful to the book .
a great , good guys win against all odds , movie with lots of action . i love that it is family friendly .
i choose this rating just because i am a huge fan of the whole underworld saga . i recommend this movie to those that like action movies about werewolves and vampires .
i have never been in charlie brown , even though i love dogs . i bought this for my husband who has never watched it
arnold does another great kid movie . i love this , when my kids were younger this came out and now it 's a christmas must see .
not my type of show . hard to follow . but the costumes were fantastic and i loved the history behind the show .
this movie is a great glimpse of europe at its best . the time is one of the most interesting in history .
this movie has a very good story and a great ending . it will put you in the christmas spirit . i highly recommend .
i use to have this on vhs tape i never knew this was on dvd now i found it yay !
we watch this movie every christmas and never get tired of watching it , . this year we sat and watched all of them !
this was what she wanted and thank you for it also she is very pleased with this dvd movie to
the kids really loved this . we liked it too . exciting . nice to choose 3-d version or standard version .
the movie i rated only 3 stars as it reminded me of so many others . also , i thought the movie was drawn out in some areas .
i bought this really brings back high school memories . great music and footage . i would recommend this to any journey fan .
we laughed lots during this movie . it was sweet and funny . good to see older actors doing good work . our teenager like it too .
the best season of the series and the best of all the sequels of all the others after the original .
i enjoyed the acting but the story was predictable and overly done . there was one or two unpredictable twists in it to make it entertaining enough for me not to notice the length .
i can not comment on this i bought this for a friend who is a big fan . i only saw one episode . thanks again .
i love this show ! i grew up in the 1970 's watching this series . i am glad they put onto dvd ! i highly recomend this to anyone that loves action drama !
you know , you think it 's so funny , you quote what they said in your own situation ? really funny , romantic and a glimpse at life a long time ago .
gave it a try and did not exactly enjoy it . the audio and video was okay and the price was okay .
really should be a comic book fan before watching this or skip it . just could not stay interested in it .
a nice little movie to relax with . have seen it several time . been a few years in between so was nice to watch it again .
there is a lot of fun , some bad special effects and a good time watching these many different science fiction shows .
this movie was extraordinary . i really like the story and that a teacher can make a difference , not in a class , in a whole school . great !
i 've become completely addicted to this show . this is one of the better shows on tv right now and glad i gave it a chance .
it 's an inspiring story of being your best and living with kindness towards others in spite of what they do to you .
watch often , waiting on final movie , but with regrets as it is the final chapter in the story .
great movie ! my boys loved it growing up , so i wanted my two grandsons to see it . ca n't go wrong with redford .
we love this movie . it is a great movie for the family to watch . i highly recommend this movie for a family movie night .
they delivered everything as promised when i ordered . i was very happy and would definitely order again from this site .
i remember the movie , even though i bought it for a gift . it was fun , good old movie star stuff .
went to the theater to see this also . great movie with action throughout . some unrealistic stunts , but its nothing different than the rest of the fast movies .
good price for a good movie that we had to have for our collection . i 'm going to keep writing because amazon thinks i should write more even though i have nothing more to say .
men in black is always good . fun watching and a lot of laughter . like the actors . go for it . you will like it .
i got these for my wife . she always loved every episode or every film series . it made her smile for a long time .
this was a great movie ! i read the book and while it was not exactly like the book , it was a good rendition of it .
nice short love story . perfect for watching on a cold winter night . enjoyed it in a movie marathon night . would recommend .
jag is one of my favorite older series . i was thrilled to be able to get all the seasons from amazon .
this is a coming of age film about two people who meet and eventually fall in love then something goes terribly wrong and one of them has to deal with the loss of his first love .
thought this was well done and would rate it as a good chick flick . this would be a good date movie .
this is a great classic for any movie collection . completely forgot how good this movie was . would definitely recommend for any movie collection .
love these movies . i brought this dvd for my mother , but she has past on . she grew up and love the debbie reynolds movies
the effects of the movie are good , the plot is original , the acting was ok. it was a nice movie to watch , but there was just something missing to me .
i had heard a lot about this series and decided to try it . it was fine but do n't think i want to pay $ 2 per episode , so i gave it a 4 .
i like it , i did n't love it . it has lots of actions and good acting , but it just wasnt for me . i say if the price is write go ahead and buy it .
i love this series and this latest one is of course the best . if this is the last then it certainly ended on a high note .
brilliant acting by all those involved , vivid and rich atmosphere . hits the sense of time and place perfectly . a joy to watch .
i liked this movie but it still do n't compare to the first one but is still better than the second one
i have the first movie , and saw that i needed this one . so i ordered it for my collection and enjoyed it .
i had high hopes for this movie but unfortunately i felt it was lacking in so many ways ... sorry matt , even you could n't save this one .
i love love love this show ! the dvd set is great ! i 'm looking forward to more seasons ! bring it on !
my grandson will stop whatever he is doing if this tom & jerry movie comes on . this cartoon movie is so well done and so close to the original movie that we all have enjoyed watching it .
robert duvall is one of my all time favorite actors . great great movie as well . love the movie and watch it from time to time .
although unrealistic , it was interesting . i enjoyed these series . i have n't seen these movies for years but i am glad i brought them . i would recommend you watch these movies .
great cast and great acting in a long movie you dont want to end . i recommend this one for your dvd library .
got some good laughs out of this season , you should buy it if you like the series also came here on time and in good shape
i like the movie i found it to be good , something to think about if you are married , see the movie
this dvd is amazing . both from a technical point of view and for it 's content . and i 'm usually a harsh critic ...
these are two great disney classics that can be shown any time of the year , but are particularly fun to watch around halloween .
the stories were interesting , the way things came together was a surprise , and the actors were great . it 's a nice movie to watch when you just want to kick back and relax . recommended .

we love tim allen when he plays in these good family movies . this is a good family movie , fun for everyone .
great laughs here and there . not quite as funny as i 'd thought it would be .
i always love gene hackman and i loved him in the french connection movies . i enjoyed the first one just a little more than the second one , though .
i absolutely love this movie . great story and great acting . the story and characters give insight into such an interesting culture and history .

i love this this disney mickey mouse classic ! now if only amazon will allow us to purchase it for our prime video library !
a great movie to have on hand at christmas time to keep the kids busy . acting was good , plot was typical . not going to win any awards but enjoyable to watch .
i like history but found this movie boring . the acting was ok and the period costumes were very good . but find a good book about lincoln , buy and read it will be money better spent .
super funny ! ! i really enjoyed the movie and would recommend purchasing the dvd to anyone regardless of their age or education .
this is an enchanting movie -- good versus evil . it is well cast and very entertaining . several of the people that i work with also love it ! !
sequels usually do n't make the grade , but this one to me went beyond the original . so i would say that this is a once a month watcher .
great movie with a great cast ! one of the best movies for the season . cary grant is wonderful as the angel . '
i love the actors and , after reading some of the reviews , i wanted to see this film . i was , however , disappointed . it did not hold my interest and found the movie boring .
love and romance with a touch of humor is a delightful way to spend a couple of hours viewing with someone you love .

it is hard to find movies that teach values and the whole family can enjoy . these movies are really good for that . my kids enjoy them , and so do i .
a really great period film . the entire cast did a superior job . the movie had class . what else can be said .
i now own the entire series and am just about through with season 4. if you love westerns this is a wonderful way to pass the time and the story lines are always about what is decent and fair .
good kids flick . my son loves it and it did n't make me want to scream which is always a bonus .

young detective dee is best when you watch it in 3d . i purchased my copy of this blu-ray in december 2013 .
rented this on a rainy night not expecting much - i should have known better with that cast . bizarre story line , but funny movie .
it was really enjoyable , a bit predictable , but enjoyable . it gives me hope that i know someone is out there for me .
great for remake with 3d effects . if you are a fan of the original and have a 3d tv it 's one to buy .
i watched the series and enjoyed it very much . thought we would like to have it in blu ray dvd so we can watch it in full at some later date .
i must admit , delivery of my product was remarkable but the movie was not what i expected . i enjoyed the first half of the movie but the rest was crap .
not at all what i expected , it was even better . great way to spend a rainy afternoon . love the ending .
love this story watch it every year sometimes not at christmas time , makes a very nice gift for friends and family and easy to order for amazon .
wow , truly an amazing story . though there were horrific times , the writer was able to share some humor . the acting was great , especially by the children .
like this movie the story the actors and the plot , i am glad to have it whenever i want to see it without having it in hand
another gold classic with beautifully restored cartoons from the middle of the past century . they never stop amusing generation after generation .
i wo n't spoil plot or ending , but must say this was very enjoyable and had a great plot twist half way through it .
interesting but convoluted story line . buy it if you are wolverine and jackman fan . it has plenty of action but it is x-men meets samurai .
not my most favorite peanuts movie but one i have enjoyed watching with my son who has taken a liking to the peanuts movies . glad to have it in our collection .
this was one of my top 3 movies growing up so when i saw this on sale for blu ray , i had to get it , love this movie .
it is n't exactly like the books , but close . some details have changed but i felt they were good changes . i really love the series and i appreciate how they put it into movie form .
its dragon ball z ... they all are great and i highly recommend them to everyone , no matter what age they maybe .
i simply love cosby ! all the shows he has ever made were clean cut , family oriented with excellent morals ! too bad we do n't have those kind of shows today ! cosby is the best !
i bought this for the classic shorts that i grew up with , it is amazing to see how far we have come in filming .
it was a good sunday afternoon movie , reminds me of a flash gordon movie .
charlie brown is a must have for the holidays . we had it on vhs , so it was time to get it on dvd .
i thought this was pretty eerie and spooky until the last 20 minutes or so . then the plot changed some and disappointed me a bit . overall a decent thriller .
... you do n't find tv series like this any more , if you are a perry mason fan this season 2 is a must have ...
vince vaughn is such a good actor , but i do n't understand why he never does movies of a higher quality . the movie is ok , but he could do much better !
awesome funny movie , i have n't seen a funny movie in a long time and this one was the greatest ... . you have to get this for your collection ... ..
great movie , full of action . very entertaining ! nice to see a female action star for a change , as it does n't happen often ; at least not in a decent movie .
one of the best movies i have ever watched and it will keep you laughing for hours on end and the actors are the best at being the original stooges
this is season 2. i have season 1 and 3 they are all good . i am waiting on season 4. when it comes out i will purchase it .
great to start a james bond collection if you like any james bond movies you will most likely enjoy all of the classics as well .
i love this movie , good story , solid pace . it 's a bit long , but i 've seen it about 10 times , and it 's still not getting old .
my sister and i grew up watching these horror flicks . it was a great buy for the last christmas . thanks so much !

i was wondering where the story was going and it ended with a different story line that i did not expect .
always pleased with this seller . will continue to use this seller . product is always in better condition than stated .
good casting , good classic sci-fi storylines . wonder woman is a good role model for young girls . this season was the best of the three seasons .
this movie was much better than i expected ! better writing , delivery , effects , you name it , it was better . my favorite batman of all .
the characters have depth and humor . the plots are mysterious to the end . the setting is delightful . we were sorry to have finished season 4. masterpiece theater is top quality entertainment !
these are my favorite ben stiller movies to date , great clean fun for the entire family . i laugh every time
it picked up naturally from the end of season one , and advanced the continuing theme of the show in an entertaining fashion .
you have to watch this movie twice to understand it clearly . it 's up there with the matrix and very eye opening
this move is fanatic because it talks about the boys who were amazing of there talent and space race era .
great cast and even better writing . this show is not you average tv show ! try it - you 'll like it !
had to return it , meant to buy the blu-ray version . i 'm sure the dvd copy would be fine , if you do n't own a blu-ray player .
it 's not bad , if you can follow it . i could n't understand them most of the time . i like irish accent but that was to much . to slow for me .
it has a very strong cast and the screenplay is written well . the plot keeps you on the edge of your sit
have to say and many agree , this has to be one of the greatest stories and best martial arts action sequences ever !
it was from the start to the finish . it almost felt like real life action that a person can face . i would recommend this to all my friends .
bought this for my son , have other seasons and am trying to collect them all . was as described , a good price and came in a timely fashion .
this documentary was very well written and manages to keep the attention of the viewer . it is long , but very interesting and enlightening . for anyone who enjoys a little science !
i missed the beginning episodes of the show and was finally able to see what happened to the characters and how they all became friends .
great movie and it came early . i am a scifi nut job and needed this to round out my collections !
love wes anderson . i 've seen all his movies so far . this is his first movie , and definitely not his best . still a good movie . can see him developing his anderson feel .
these two movies are both great family movies , and i have enjoyed them both a number of times . great service was provided for my order and i am completely satisfied with the quality of the movie .
great movie one that stands the test of time . family friendly and funny . much better than anything that i have seen lately
i was expecting more . i am disappointed in this production . did not seem to be well written . it is not a high quality production .
that i had to spend very little to get it . i love the prime videos . it will alway be there when i want to watch it .
great special effects . plot is from the early series but presented with a more adult theme . entertaining for all . a definite must see before watching later seasons .
i am a big dexter fan and absolutely love this season , definitly worth buying and watching . i watch it while i work out and my workouts definitly fly by with this show !
this movie is a great movie . i enjoyed it a lot . i like the way the story goes . it is funny all the way through .
not really much to say other than i watch many of the episodes on cable . i just wanted to have the dvd on hand just in case i wanted to watch a certain show .
i really like that movie , its a really good movie that i could watch over and over again ... . its true ! ! ! !
while not as good as the original , still good enough to be worth watching . if you liked the first one , you will enjoy this one as well .
i wanted the entire set of the harry potter dvd 's and my kids and i really have enjoyed watching them .
still scary ... great addition for collectors of this series and the blu-ray tech is just amazing . the special effects are flawless and the performances are top-notch !
the dvd arrived in great condition and came to me in the time frame suggested . now the family can enjoy it .
i do n't want to give anything away , since the discovery is part of the fun . all i can say is - what a treat !
it 's a love story with kung fu , which is the only kind of love story a person like me would sit in front of the television to watch for longer than ten minutes .
excellent ! the brits know how to do horror and comedy so very well .
it was funny but dumb it 's so stupid i did n't watch the end and still have n't , my friend loved it but he 's goofy anyway .
why was the sister and brother crazy ? kind of stupid the way they were . i do not recommend anyone to rent or buy this movie .
it 's a fun little mystery for children or adults who like a little mystery . i enjoyed it but based on the previews i had expected more .
nicely done , who could go wrong with william powell ? a nice addition to my library
i love these two ! ! when i see them i know whatever it is it 's gon na ' be hilarious !
one of the best shows on tv . cant wait till the next episodes come out for season 5. just watch the show and you 'll see what im talking about .

purchased as a gift for my granddaughter . she is very pleased with this . a good gift for a child would recommend to other parents .
this is the best film out of the scrooge movies ( in my opinion ) . if you like & # 34 ; a christmas carol & # 34 ; then go ahead and buy this !
excellent blu ray disc . the movie itself is outstanding ! ! ! if you have a blu ray player , this movie is worth adding to your collection .
i finally watched this and i have always liked tom selleck . i found it very humorous at time and very touching at times .

fast delivery came new as advertised . i love bruce willis , this was a fun film to watch , lots of action and comedy lines .
this is a good movie for young ones . children who enjoy dinosaurs should enjoy little foot and more of his adventures .
i loved this series and the characters are very good and interesting to watch and & # 34 ; get to know & # 34 ; the mysteries are really good .
this was the season of glee that sold me on the show , and still is . i 'm so happy that it came at a decent price .
loved the different birds and the knowledge there was . the background on where all these were taken was put together in a way that anyone could understand .
the story line is a bit weak but the actors kinda save the film . witherspoon is ( as usual ) pretty much right on .
i really like listening to his comedic skits . i am glad to find it here , since it was n't available on dvd in my area too long . thank you , its great !
it was such a good buy for one movies much less ten movies . it was a pleasant surprise to get ten movies for this price .
great movie but a little slow . but by the end of the movie i did n't care it was slow anymore . would recommend this movie
for any one who liked frank sinatra , this is the perfect dvd to own . bought it for my husband for christmas , as he is a big frank fan . he loves it .
got this nicely packaged hitchcock collection and have been taken to a world of masterful suspense , thrills , twists in a class of its own , and will stand its test of time . great collection to have
we love this show and the whole series . so sorry to see it end . great dynamic between lewis and hathaway .
it was ok , i probably would have not bought it if i seen it in the movies . it was filmed very dark and hard to see . i liked the first one better .
these movie classics was a christmas gift ... for my grandkids but was loved b enjoyable they are movies that will be watched all year round ...
my son loves this show . i think it is age appropriate with out being too violent and it is entertaining for my husband as well .

i have most of the dvd 's on the bible series , and this one is probably one of the best of the whole lot .

this was a low budget movie & i did n't think i would like it , but i have to say i really enjoyed the movie & for the price you just ca n't beat it !
this is a very well done period movie , one might even say a costume play , and depicts a strong woman in a difficult period for women . would watch again .
ed norton is amazing in this film . the story 's unusual . some parts go too far for my taste ... but otherwise good .
this movie is a great thrill ride . i had never seen it before and i did n't know what to expect and i was not disappointed . very entertaining

as always lucille ball was the queen of comedy and such fun watching the old shows again . no matter how many times these shows are watched they still make you laugh .
great great movie it is a must see i got both parts and ca n't wait for the third to come out .
a great story , we really enjoyed it tremendously . i ca n't believe we did n't hear more about this movie when it was in theatres .
i liked this series better the first few seasons . it has become too predictable . it 's still better than most of what is on tv these days , though .
the first and second seasons were pretty good , it kept me wanting to see more . the third season is just bad . i could n't get past the second show .
i am really enjoying this series , the characters and their roles are great . i would like more details just for my own curiosity . but over all i would recommend it .
i loved this movie ... it was so true i do the same exact things being a teenage drama queen myself
an excellent account of the tragic events in new york city . this should be a must see for everyone so that we do not forget .
another matt damon scary look at the possibilities of the real nature of our world . i enjoyed this movie very much .
continuing on with mysteries . really do n't have to them in any order . recommend the whole series .
my granddaughter only knows the current power rangers , so although she watched it , i do n't know that she was all that excited about it .
what can you say about a classic dvd . it 's a great addition to my collection .
i bought this as a gift for a fellow baseball lover , but may eventually end up having to buy another copy for myself .
what an awesome drama . see it if you have time ! i do n't normally watch drama films , but this was extremely worth it !
my grandson 's liked it , it was good light entertainment that went good with popcorn . the movie was what it was , just fun .
the subject matter was hard to watch at times but it was based on true events . you just realize how much is political in the real world when you watch a show such as this one .
such a great disney classic . i grew up with this movie and now my 2 daughters love it ! who does n't love a wonderful disney movie ? !
very good superhero movie with a good balance of dialogue and action . rare movie that 's a good watch for kids and adults .
well made and very entertaining . it lived up to the hype but was n't quite what i would call unforgettable . but it was very good .
i absolutely love lucy . & # 34 ; i love lucy & # 34 ; is the most entertaining and enjoyable tv show ever created . love the show and i will be purchasing ever season .
this completed my set of this series . steve mcqueen is one of my favorite western actors . this is a great series . i watch them over and over .
two delightful films about what america should be all about and is not . fun and very well acted with people we have enjoyed over the years .
a christmas gift for someone who loved this movie as a child . it arrived quickly and in perfect condition . definitely worth getting this movie to make someone very happy on christmas morning .
errol flynn is one of my favorite actors . i have n't found a movie i did not like him in . i would recommend this dvd to anyone .
jeff dunham is hilarious and offers up a new special which i can easily recommend and is great to see during the halloween season !
i hate it , but my friend loves it . i got all 7 seasons for him as a christmas gift . it was very expensive . should have been sold as a set .
this was one of the funniest movies i have seen in a was while we watch this over and over and over . our kids love this movie
i really enjoyed the film . the story of the beginning of the adventure is the best experience . i would definetly recommend this product to friends and family .
no comment , no comment , no comment , no comment ... .i just do n't have anything nice to say . maybe it 's my age or ... no comment .
i ca n't believe how fast it came to my home . the dvd is wonderful and great price in the stores it would be more money .
sad to see the series end so soon . i believe there is more to tell about the lives of the people .
had never seen before and they 're extremely well done but not my favorite . will probably grow on me though . great in blu-ray format .
i bought this movie without any clue as to what the movie was about . it was very affordable and i just went for it . the movie is actually a different kind of contemporary love story .
great movie , very funny , would recommend to anyone that enjoys gay flicks with out quite as much sex , although porn is great too .
this is not a fast moving , action packed movie . it 's closer to a thinking piece , but i liked it very much .
this one is a classic . we like having the blu-ray / dvd combo to be able to use the blu-ray at home and take the dvd with us on trips .
amazing movies ! especially the original three . the most recent one is kinda lame , but it 's still indiana jones ! ca n't wait to see in on blu-ray .
this movie is fun for the whole family , adults will love the humor while kids will love the whole thing .
i truly enjoy watching this movie multiple times per year . lots of action with a mix of historical events . great stuff .
old favorite and the best in the trilogy . mib 2 is n't too bad either . did n't care much for mib 3 .
always enjoy john wayne movies . have n't been disappointed yet . wish the movie was in color . always love his war movies .
omg ! i love love love this dvd series ! ! ! ! i watched it twice on tv already and i had to buy the set to own !
each one of the characters is perfect . the humor is so far out , and unpredictable . i enjoy every episode i watch .
something to watch and make you think . starts off slow , but then slowly draws you in . made for an enjoyable evening .
if you are a fan of the books , the movies are just as good . if you are a fan of tom selleck than this is a must for all fans .
because it is a funny movie . bette midler and danny devito are hilarious . i love them both and together they 're amazing .
this sitcom is so funny ! everything about this whole series is funny ! i would tell everybody to get this sitcom ! plus it came in excellent condition and came extra quick !
a crap movie , one of those movies were the 60 second preview , is the best part of the movie , very disapointed with this dvd , as they say never judge a book by the cover
not really a feel good movie but we really enjoyed it . denzel is amazing and it 's well directed . it makes you wonder about the pilot industry !
typical bruce willis action . it was fun with his wise guy humor but some of the stunts were over the top .
i saw this on the history channel and was so excited i could purchase it so others could see it .
how can you go wrong with the duke ? five great movies to choose from and enjoy . and enjoy it you will .
a riveting and thinking film of if this ever were really to happen . i found it keeping me to my seat and on my toes
i watched this movie as a kid . the classic comic character turned to a movie . the action you remember . 2 thumbs up .
we saw this on tv and i just had to own it , have never laughed so hard in a long time .
timothy olyphant need i say more . i could watch him in anything . he is a very under rated actor . i love him in justified and even when he plays a bad guy .
great series . i 'm glad this is coming back on air , i think on netflix . you ca n't go wrong watching this .
my twin kids love this story . they ask us to show them this dvd all the time . for me , as an adult , it 's a typical disney story .
just got this for xmas , love the film , but this is definitely not high resolution ! if i had bought it i 'd be returning it .
love the first season . helps really set the tone for the coming years of this generally well written show . rent it .
but i really liked this movie ... ... .i have also shared it with some friends and they liked it . it may not be totally like the play but it is still a worth while film .

loved all these movies and it was a hit with my son ! hope to see another one come out also .
i was looking forward to seeing this , but after seeing the trailer , i felt like the show was given away .
liam neeson is awesome but the movie is dark and depressing . not a great way to spend a saturday afternoon . fairly predictable . wo n't watch it again or recommend it .
they spent a lot of time developing the story line at the start ... how clark got to earth . well done .
this is a very interesting and educational watch that is under appreciated . also , great acting and writing that makes you attached to the characters .
this is a great movie in leonardo dicaprio fashion ! it is not a family movie by any means , but despite the length a good watch .
if you like adventures and sci-fi you will love this series ! i am hooked ! i am looking forward to buying the rest of the series !
funny , funny , funny , and more funny . the music was great and the acting was good . a good tyler perry play . if you like tyler perry plays you would love this one .
by the 3rd or 4th season , home improvement had come into its own . the 5th season is excellent . any fan of the show will need to add this one to their collection .
exactly what was advertised . great fun for the entire family . for us it was replacing old vhs tapes to complete our christmas movie collection
this series was very enjoyable and the mix of comedy and action come off very well . i 'll be purchasing further episodes as i will enjoy watching them over again .
had to buy the trilogy , but did n't expect them to make more , but will buy them also ... the special effects is very well done .
my husband and i love this series ! the episodes are well written , keep your interest , and the acting is wonderful ! do n't miss it !
it awesome and show what you can do if you put your mind to it and i think kid and adult would like it and it was a awesome movie to me
i do n't really understand all the hype about this movie- it 's mediocre at best . there are lots of better animated films out there .
this was a great movie , so was thrilled to get it at a great price and to receive it so quickly
i really liked this one because it was the first in the series and deserved to be to be the first .
what woman does n't like sean connery . since 007 he 's been on my favorites list . i love to see him and hear him .
excellent show with good writing . the characters are complex . it is fun to watch and see where the story line is going .
what a wonderful show - i am so happy i got this dvd , ca n't stop watching it , thoroughly loving it .
this special edition of the dvd arrived in good condition . the movie is not quite the same as i remembered it to be , though . animation quality has greatly advanced since the 1950s .
sandra and ryan have a great chemistry . this is one of those movies ii can watch over and over . betty white steals every scene she 's in ! love it .
what can i say but i love this movie ... the songs and the people in it are a ten in my book ...
this movie , although subtitled was very funny a well made movie a love story for all to enjoy ... everyone has some kind of fear
elvis movies are always great fun ! this was purchased as a gift and they loved it ! take a chance and find out why !
this is one of my all time favorite movies now . it 's got everything i like ; comedy , drama , romance , adventure , and music ... i absolutely love this film !
another fantastic performance from denzel ! very human . one of his best since training day . definitely worth a watch , if not purchase .
i have the complete collection and this was the last part i purchased . it is a must have for your compilation .
all i can say is ( funny ) ( funny ) and ( funny )
i have purchased all of the videos in this series . i highly recommend them . my daughter loves them and she has learned so much from them also . she ask to watch them over and over .
i enjoyed both movies and each had things that made for a good family film .
i like animation . i especially like a good story . this one was fun and had a good story . i liked it .
my two and five year old liked this movie ok but they did n't stay glued to it the first time . they did what it twice after that time .
i took my children to see it at the movies and we all enjoyed it very much . it is a good movie with a good storyline that kids can learn from .
a great movie for younger kids . i like to have movies on hand for children . this was a delightful movie .
what a pleasant , well acted , cute plot movie . it 's an `` oldie '' but `` goodie '' and all should enjoy it .
this movie actually made me cry a little at the end . i thought this was funny & a little heartwarming at times . i liked this movie .
nothing really can top the original inspector morse series but this comes very close . i enjoyed this season and it 's definitely worth buying !
i watch a lot of movies and like to collect all the worth while ones . these are a must to have and arrived on time and in great condition
still loved it when i was younger at movies still love it as an adult ... . must be the chicago side in me ...
love this dvd series very much . many extras for each season . if you are a fan of doc martin , this collection series is for you !
the space parts were corny , but take those out and you 've got a great james bond flick .
its a shame that this show ended after just a single season . i would have liked to see it continued .
how do you not love this movie ? i got this for my grandson who loves all things disney . he watched the last one so much it wore out the disc !
we love this jerry lewis video . it is done really well and is a great story . loved it as a child and had been looking for awhile to find it in the usa dvd zone .
the ending left you hanging - but i do n't see anymore seasons . i guess they figure they might come back .
bought this for a friend so he could see the first season and why i got hooked . love this series and so sad it 's done next year .
i thought the premise was good and would make a great movie . the premise was good but the movie took a strange direction . it ended ok but could have been so much better .
this is a great movie that 's based on a true story . if you are into sports films , you need this one .
this was a good movie . blu ray makes it some better but not worth the extra cost . stay with your regular movie on this one .
it was such a shame no body did anything about this at the time . a dark time in our recent history for sure . get it and watch it .
i love the supernatural series and was absolutely thrilled to find the entire fourth season here at a much cheaper rate than i could find in most stores .
w did not enjoy this and turned it off half way through . save your money since this is a real stinker !
monk is one of my favorite shows . even though it 's on netflix , i still wanted to buy the dvds so i am collecting them .
as always a good go to when i want a change in my workout . easy to follow and still work up a sweat .
it was alright , not what i would consider on of denzel washington 's best movies ( plot ) , but as his skills as an actor were very good .
this movie is really funny . this movie is good as a date movie . the story is really funny . actors did amazing job .
finally a series you can watch without sex and violence ! a witty detective series that you will watch over and over , and like a good book you just ca n't put down , frost delivers !
arnold hits it this time i think it is 5 stars and this is the kind of movie i watch over and over . great addition to our movie collection .
standard cop drama with some stiff acting , in parts , what keeps the movie unique is its 40 years old and still has the best car chase scene ever filmed
part two of a cool as hell funny movie ! this movie rocks ! you have to have this movie in your collection ! buy it people !
great movie collection these movies are very good thumbs up for eastwood really ca n't say much more then all the other reviews have already said .
good movie prequel to the lord of the rings trilogy . good blend of computer generated graphics and actual background visual effects . nice adaption from the book .
best example of the westerns and their characters that i grew up with . so many familiar faces and knowing it was wayne 's last .
wonderful show , great content , perfect for a new fan or a hardcore collector ! a must have for any adventure time fan . highly recommended .
the only bad thing about this british tv series was that it ended . great acting , great everything . another winner , that 's for sure .
with the cast that it featured i expected more . overall was boring and predictable . a few funny moments but overall a disappointment .
if you like british comedies , this set of holiday shows is for you . this collection has some of the best british comedies and it makes you want to see more of them .
great movie . slow beginning but very engaging . good science fiction . would recommend to anyone that likes science fiction .. : o )
this movie was funny , but now as funny as the first film . this one was a bit more crude and just crazy .
colin and jamie are a great duo . you have action , hot guys , comedy ... everything a movie needs and this movie has it .
i say this movie and it keep you watching . it a old movie but it good . my dad had this movie and i saw him watch this back then . so i got it for my self .
i love this movie . i seen this movie once , but with commercials loaded in the movie . so , i decided to purchase the movie to see it in full length
not exactly what i was looking for but not entirely a dud . a 70 's era action series set in london . good acting but not a lot of action . slow moving .
this is a perfect movie for all of the family will be one of my regular christmas movies in the future
anthony hopkins makes this film though the other actors were very good . it 's an interesting story shot in a beautiful location . i would recommend it to most people .
i would definitely purchase this item again and recommend it to others . terrific family movie and sweet story . love it
i watched it for about 15 minutes and quit . it is not my kind of movie.i hate the fact that amazon makes me waste my time with these required fields . this product was not worth my time .
if you liked the previous american pie movies , you will like this one as well . it has about the same cast of characters with some new twists .
compared to other shows , i would have given this five stars . but not as good as some of dexter 's previous seasons . still thrilling !
really good series . i see it was directed by tom hanks and stephen spielberg . worth watching . wish they would have made a few more .
great season . i do n't want to spoil it for everyone , but it was a great follow up to the 4th season .
this is an all time classic movie and a particular favourite that we really enjoy watching so very much . awesome .
pretty good story line and having the characters thoughts known to us helps make the plot believable . the guys are hot too and it is cool how they finally hook up .
we love midsomer murders ( set 17 ) . my husband and i are big fans of this show . we have all their dvds . very enjoyable to watch .
best movie ever ! ! ! one we watch every year around christmas time , who does n't love this movie ? no complaints buy it !
high crimes was a very good thrill movie you really did not no his guilty to almost the end and ashley judd is a very good actress she just doesnt have a lot of movies
a great movie that has clever lines , interesting characters , and a good plot . julia roberts and hugh grant have a chemistry that is delightful to watch .
good movie something different , had sort of that men in black style of action , worth watching good action stunts and comedy as well
this was a movie i remember from along time ago and im happy i was able to find it here
i purchased this items as a gift . the price was really great . it was shipped on time and i would buy more items in the future .
i have really enjoy the series and i am glad to own it in my collection . get it or rent
the video was happy and sad , and just right for me . the video is on my top self and now is my favorite video .
this was the greatest show to enjoy . i hope the actors and writers realize how much joy they gave to the world with this show .
great movie with great sound and visuals . what it on a hd tv and get blown away
i 'm so happy to find this series is available and i 'm planning on adding all of them to my tv collection .
this is a fun movie , lots of enjoyable characters , and a joy to watch ! some good historical characters in the movie , that give an opportunity for lessons on the spot ! !
it showed how families take care and understand each other . it also shows how age changes everyone . we really do not know each other we only think we do
the acting , scenery and basic story line are great . however , the characters are shallow . this viewer has the impression that the book must be better .
but i watched it anyway . i hope there really are n't little tiny kids who have to live like that . it made me sad
i love this movie i have watched it about 12 times and would love to watch it again and again
i love bones and this is a great season in particular . the only issue i had with it was the price . it 's rather expensive for a series with only 13 episodes !
scooby-doo : i bought scooby doo for my grandson he love to watch him and the things he gets in to .
it is easy to understand . we had a lot of fun watching it . and there lots of episodes to pick from . i recommend it .
great job done by all the featured actors in a very interesting and unusual story . animal lovers , in particular , should enjoy this one .
this is a very funny movie . i cant wait till the dvd comes out . if you havent seen it do and you will be laughing the whole way through
i enjoyed frank 's story and the telling of his transformation . it does feel like a lot is left out between his final outcome and the end of the documentary . still , it is an inspiring watch .
this is much different than most of the teenage anime . likely not too good for small kids . each of the episodes are good .
i 'm not sure why anyone who watch this movie . with all the big name actors i thought it would me awesome . boring !
once again , i am a big tyler perry fan , and this play was great . i actually liked the play than the movie !
ok movie , a little slow in place even though i am a huge lotr fan . the 3d was also only ok , wish i could say it was great .
i started watching this but did n't have enough time to finish it . i think tyler perry is very funny . i will finish it soon .
i received the dvd pretty fast . i really enjoyed watching it , played really well . it brought back memories from when i was a young kid growing up watching the hulk .
perfect christmas movie . what a great story that we can all relate to at one time . who does n't dream of skipping christmas ?
do n't listen to critics . what do they know ? i know this is an awesome sci-fi adventure ! that 's what i know . if you want some serious fun ... buy this movie !
very predictable and too much computer generation . weak story and too much tom cruise . the middle of the movie was just dull .
this was such a treat ! have n't seen since i was a little girl , but still wonderful ! will be sharing with another generation of viewers when the grandchildren come for a visit .
amazing stories of a family and it 's amazing home . you wo n't be able to stop watching this drama ! wonderful dramatic performances .
great season ! they got all the episodes and special features only only three discs . good quality packaging . the big bang theory is great !
my daughter loves this movie , and has since she was little . i bought it as a surprise gift for her , and she loves it and thinks it 's even better in bluray .
a total junk and waste of time nonsense . not recommended . thank god for the fast forward feature . it was obvious from the beginning this would be a disaster and it was .
i bought this dvd because george c. scott starred in it . the rendition is a cut above many other productions of the story because the acting is quite good .
i saw this movie years ago and it is still one of my favorite . every once in a while i have a desire to see it again and again .
i would have to say i just started watching this season and i completely enjoy the plots , the turns and everything in between great series to watch i ca n't wait to see season two .
once again , the team working on this brilliant series continues telling the tales of the dark knight and the trials he must face to protect his beloved city !
this was a pretty cute picture . not as cute as i would have liked . turns out alright in the end .
i enjoyed dark crimes 50 movie pack it had a lot of movies i never seen before and most likely never will be on tv .
great classic movie , i never seen it at all in the 80 's , the first time i saw is on cable and i decided to buy it !
great acting , great movie . there was a lot of suspense here and it kept me guessing all the way to the end .
i seen it before and it was funny i said i wanted to see it again well i got the movie and it was funny
this is a really good movie , you have to pay attention and stay in the room the whole movie ... or pause it if you have you leave the room ...
i have been looking for this tv series on dvd for a while . i saw it i bought it am very happy
full house is a great family show this is a great season so if you feel nostalgic when you hear the theme get this set .
this is a great movie ! i would recommend this purchase . my son loves this movie ! this is a funny movie and has a great story .
i first saw this one on pbs many years ago . my wife did n't . we really enjoy this one .
my wife and i enjoy the family friendly show . brings back great memories of what america was and could be again .
it arrived on time and i enjoyed it from the very first minute forward . very glad that i decided to purchase .
a real winner ! cary grant lovers will adore this one . his comedic ability shines ! for a rainy day of lighthearted movies , this is a must have .
this is the best copy so far ! please , , , strong script , great acting , and a great close . cary grant is incredible . keep these classics coming .
this australian movie is full of action , but the superb are the 3d format , make live it every second of the movie , recommended
i was happy to see that the story line of the priest falling in love being carried out to the end .
somewhat entertaining but also rather boring and too fast , too short etc ... however , is also nice because the stories are nice and well portrayed ...
simply well done . worth the money . i recommend this set of discs to anyone . beautifully photographed and produced . great job .
another example of a large cast of stars not making a good movie . only got about 15 mins into the movie , before i could n't stand it any longer .
could not wait to get this blu-ray , i am very happy with this purchase , great sound , i also purchased the cd
this movie is good , entertaining , and funny . with a good storyline and worthy acting make this one a winner ... barely .
i thought this would be a good movie from what i saw on tv . but it was not good at all : (
this show was ok but they are nothing like the originals as i feel these are more scary for kids . have put it away for a few more years until they get older .
my grandson wanted it , i have a copy which he has almost wore out , now he has his own great family movie
i saw this as a teenager and have always loved it . what a beautiful story of love and loss . it helps you remember how short life is and how important the little things are .
this movie was good but a little slow for my liking . the drama was interesting and drug out . would watch more like this one .
he is so funny ; watch it without small children around due to language but you will definitely laugh and agree to many things said ; so worth the belly laughs you will get
old movie , funny movie and it was reasonably priced . could not get it via netflix , so 4 more words here .
i was hurt to see this show go . a must buy for fans of the show . superman will live on in my dvd player .
this item shipped fast ! i love this tv show , and it came and works great . it was even in the new packaging .
excellent movie , great performance from all the actors and what a story line ! i highly recommend this movie , especially if you love drama and suspense !
a great dvd , well done ! i have bought the whole set ! great feature to pick black & white or color viewing !
movie started off slow but built up to be pretty good . ca n't think of much more to say than that .
this picture was fantastic to say the least . this is easily one of denzel washington 's best performances of his entire career .
this was the third and last tarzan entry for mike henry . great family entertainment . again , great story and great family entertainment .
i love most of will smith work and movies and this movie is one of my favorites . the chemistry between will and gene is incredible . a must see movie
have not watched this dvd yet - but in terms of purchase , i was satisfied with the cost and was received in good order ! !
lame acting and the the same story again . it was too long for a very stupid ending . safe your money and pass on this one .
i have watched the whole story - box set 1 , box set 2 , and box set 3 many times when television was boring . i thoroughly enjoyed it .
i was amazed if how awesome this movie is . it has cool fight scenes and a great story . good for all ages . cool movie !
this movie was so bad i could only ( barely ) stomach the first 2 scenes . it is hard to believe they put money into this film only to destroy it with wooden dialogue and acting .
again , i can not say enough about the jesse stone series . it is great . good story , great actor , and wonderful scenes .
a terrific old movie for the entire family . it is a must have for any family dvd or movie collection . i especially love the old style feel of the production . brings me back ...
funny funny movie . eddie murphy is hilarious as well as the supporting cast . great picture quality and sound . definite addition to eddie murphy collection .
i have to admit i cut it off , i did not consider it worth my time , terrible . i am surprised i watched it as long as i did .
... that reminds me of the feeling i got when i did not want to look under my bed during the night as a child .
this movie is a fave of mine . the thing i love about it is that it looks so believable . it 's eerie but you never know why until the end .
it is a great , interesting movie . it has a little suspense . it ended great & sad at the same time . it shows how things is not always the way they seem .
love this classic christmas movie . i was n't impressed with the remake and wanted my friend to see the original . nothing can beat this classic .
packaging very well and the price was well for the item . love scooby doo and this was an excellent product .
not as good as i thought it would be but still pretty good . i was kind of waiting for it to be over .
this movie was horrible . so bad that it is the only movie i have ever been to that when it was over everyone in the theater started laughing at how bad it was .
this is one of my favorite movies and i do n't even remember it out in theatres . the concept is so funny and cute and reflects an appreciation of honesty and trust .
it 's a very well done movie with good action . the actors played the roles very well and kept everything very interesting .
this dvd brings back good childhood memories i loved this show when i was a kid watched it with my brother alot
the movie works and it does pause for a min or so but then it continues so therefore its ok
i have liked each movie in this series of movies . i would watch each addition to the series or all three of these over again .
very good for those who like sherlock holmes . the modern version really holds up well in comparison to other programs of this type
franco was not the best choice for this part . the special effects are good , but really the story is flat and not that interesting .
my son 's moved this movie and i wanted to have it for my grand children when they visit . i love the movie too .
what a classic adam sandler movie . this movie is hilarious and my dad actually likes it ( he is the worst critic ever ) .
i give it five stars as you really have to watch to the end bit slow but has it good points anyone would enjoy this
i love csi . it my favorite show i had to get it on dvd amazon was only place that had it for a good price so that 's why i gave it a five star
a great , timeless movie . i really enjoyed this as a kid and was glad to rewatch it with my niece .
this was a fun movie , not a great movie , or anything outstanding , but really a lot of fun ! i 'll watch it again myself .
quirky , funny movie . very creative with beautiful cinematography . story is very interesting . recommended !
buy this movie.it is so funny and the whole family will enjoy it and be rolling over with laughter . great for family night .
finally , a movie out there for girls too ! ! ' boys will enjoy also , but there are so many for them . adults will love too .
love murder , she wrote ... have watched all 12 seasons twice now and the movies are just as great !
excellent just dose not do justice to this movie . i was glued to the chair while the movie as playing
enjoyed the movie , all the characters were great , can see why it was nominated for so many awards ! it is worth the price .
good , but not great . did n't quite make the transition to such a modern setting .
this is one of the best fonda films that i have seen and it does not get the notice it deserves .
great movie to add to the the great books . it is good to have a complete collection of all the books and movies to compliment each other .
great episode . really good picture and sound . you will like it to . enjoy great picture and sound . great actors too .
you do not need to say more then madonna , she really knows how to put a concert together .
thank you so much for season 3 ! keep them coming ! we want the entire series !
this was a gift for someone and they said they liked it . i thought it was ok , but nothing special .

he 's so totally awesome i buy his dvd 's because i enjoy them so much and i 'll watch them over and over without getting tired of them .
one the best anime films of all time . so happy its now on blu-ray . very time is see this movie have to watch & watch again .
a man is searching for his place with god . a high school football team learn all about god and what his place is in the game . very inspiring . get the tissues out .
bogart should have done more comedy , it really works in this movie . not over the top but extremely funny . well worth watching .
bought this movie for a friend who is a collector himself and know walter matthau it 's got to be funny - his dry humor is worse watching any movie of his
i have seen this movie many times enjoyed it each and every time it is an oldie but a goodie i like dragons and these are n't as cheesy as some i have seen
you ca n't go wrong with a subject like this ! god so loved the world that he gave his only son ! will view this in the near future ! thank you for having this movie !

if you love the alien movies this is a great collection to add to your movie collection . a must buy for fans .
all three of these movies was very good . it was kind of confusing but it all became to make since .
this a classic football movie . forget the remake this is the real deal ! the dvd has a great transfer and some cool extras .
nothing in the story was particularly interesting or even held together . as you can expect from a high budget us movie , the special effects were good . the acting was nothing much .
loved it but it made everyone cry and was not something for the children to watch , but there was a good lesson to learn .
my 7 & 9 year olds loved this movie - as did my wife and i. great story - nice animals . i strongly suggest this movie .
you can see so many things wrong with what we thought the future was going to be ... fun to watch
too much scifi the too different of the original which is a must to understand all the new versions of the movie .
gorgeous actress and you 'll be even more amazed when you watch the making of the movie .
great move and service . the movie was as i remembered it . great action and historically accurate i enjoyed it from start to finish .
only a good movie not the best a few good scenes with great action great acting by sandra bullock with unreal circumstances
i absolutely love this movie ( my favorite movie of all time ) and i recommend it to anyone . best actors in the world , best story in the world ! ca n't go wrong !
tom cruise was excellent in this . it was action packed and intriguing . there 's a bit to it so listening and watching everything helps to get it all . good flick .
best animated comedy series ever and one of the all-time best comedies period . i like the later seasons a little better than the earlier seasons , but i highly recommend them all !
wow wow wow my son and i are hook to this series and it gets better by the season . 100 % recommended
boring and fell asleep trying to understand what 's going on . someone else may find it better but it was n't for me
this is a show i enjoy watching . i bought volume one of season one , and plan to buy other volumes .
this is a great series , i enjoyed then and now . the characters are unique and the story line is very interesting . i recommend this series highly .
it had all the elements funny , drama , excitement and old people kicking a -- and taking names and doing great stunts what more can you ask for
i think this is my favorite season , this and the 1st and 3rd seasons are my favorite , you should buy it . worth it .

this was a wonderful singing movie . all the people in there with their musical talent going praise to god , moved me . loved it ! ! ! !

at first , this movie was hard to understand about what was going on but i stayed with it and when it was over i watched it again and it is a fascinating science fiction movie .
had this in vcr format and my daughter wanted the dvr for christmas . we love this movie . fun and lighthearted .
this movie is fantastic ! everything about it is well done ! the transformation scene is the most graphic ive ever seen ! give this awesome werewolf story a chance !
kinda sad ! i like it a lot ! wish it would have show the future a bit more ! great over all
character development is believable ... .the story line is sometimes too predictable but the actors did a wonderful job of working around the flaws in the script . i looked forward to all segments .
the actors in this show are excellent & their interaction is excellent . i would recommend this series to anyone that wants something different , action packed & great characters . again , you can not beat this cast .
seinfeld : season 7 is great family entertainment . the individual characters are unique and together they make life entertaining for everyone to watch !
i think i paid 12 dollars for this when i got it . what can you say about 2 of the greatest modern westerns based in history ? wonderful cinematography .
great classic ! clean , wholesome entertainment . most everyone takes time to watch this movie during the christmas season . i have always loved it .
a must have collection of movies if you just adore those great judy garland movies ! they are those movies you can watch over and over and get that feel-good feeling each time !
the only thing that makes this movie is how hot the girl is ; way to much language and drug use ( plus the fights are stupid ) i would not recommend this move
i 've always seen bits and pieces of this movie and finally rented it . definitely took me back to the time of my childhood memories during christmas time . good addition to your collection of christmas movies .
saw this advertised on tv and i love pretty much all of tyler perry 's plays , so i ordered this one .
fun movies . they still hold up over the years . it gives a feel for how innocent we were back then . blood and gore have become almost too much at times in the movies of today .
just a lot of old fashion t & a . a cheesy plot but brings back nostalgia of the 70 's . let your kids watch to see what mom and pop had to choose from when they were kids
i love this movie , it was so entertaining since the beginning of the movie and throughout , it 's a clean and funny movie , loved it !
got it . love it just like all the rest . not many shows that i can say that about after 8 seasons .
as for seasons 1 and 3 , i purchased used media and was very pleased with the quality and the value of the product .
meg and russel are always great . sorry it ended the way it did . but that is the way life is . but it had a good story line .
3 starts is probably more than it deserves , but it gets this rating because most everything else offered on amazon prime has even less redeeming value .
i laughed so hard i had a hard time catching my breath . if you love robin williams this is the movie for you .
what can one say about disney , it was a request from my daughter for christmas - ca n't wait to watch it with her . by the way she is 34 !
this is a very funny series and has some wonderful comedy . i really enjoy the watching this series and would recommend it
this is a gift ; the packaging is good , so i expect this will be an enjoyable movie for my friend whose birthday is in another month . he loves westerns .
i loved this so much that i bought all in the love series and enjoy watching them over and over again . great family movie .
this series is amazing and wonderful . we never miss an episode and we will watch this set over and over thru the winter . thank you for speedy delivery and great product ,
i enjoyed it , but in the end it does get a little long . good action with all the old guys we grew up with that were in movies we watched years ago .
this is a great movie , out of all the super hero movies to date i have to say that the avengers is top notch entertainment for all . buy this movie you wo n't be disappointed .
is one of my favorite show and good buy and a good sale would buy from again great to watch
you can tell that this was one of the great tv series simply by seeing how many seasons it was on .
i have the dvd already but i had to buy a new one cause i have a crack in it but it 's worth buying , love the story and hugh jackman
a crime family you ca n't help but love . suspense , love its all here with history told at its most entertaining level .
this is one of my favorite shows and am glad amazon offers it to us , my only problem is am having trouble with amazon streaming .
this is certainly one of the best mib movies i have seen . it certainly is better than the second movie ( which i liked ) and is as good or better than the first mib . good fun !
i 've enjoyed this movie from the first time i saw it many years ago . i decided to get it for my son who likes comedies , also . it is a classic to me .
so much taste in the story telling , only an italian could do it !
great ! ! i strongly recomend it ! anthony hopkins is the best ! good suspense and love the ending . second time i watch it
this movie went straight to the heart . i 'm not sure if this movie would be for younger children although for adults its great .
i 'm watching this movie right now and i had to pause it just so i could write this review this is a another great movie well back to the movie
this is exactly what you would expect from billy . all of the classic moves . great cardio workout . really enjoy it !
i love this movie ! it 's a great animated movie , even if it 's not historically accurate . the songs are wonderful and the characters are endearing . definitely one of my favorites . = )
it 's ok. i just do n't really care for these kind of movie 's . a friend was here and wanted to see it . i guess it is probably a ok movie if you like this stuff .
great movie for fans of the first movie . i was amazed at the creativity and the beauty of it . great for all ages .
big explosions , video game type movie . it was more about graphics than plot . do yourself a favor and stick with the original .
for the fans of frank and the lovers of a great comedic plot . it is a good clean movie which you can watch with you little ones .
definitely a good buy and has been inspiring to watch to . inspiring and all together feel good movie . just awesome !
great price , prompt service , i would highly recommend this to add to your collection at home . do n't miss out on this one .
one of the best , if not the best . you read the other reviews . just get it already . the price is right .
having listed to audio book , wanted to see movie . book was great , kinda disappointed the movie went off course from the book somewhat .
good acting , good story , good plot and a good ending . it even shows you how to pick up girls that you never would have expected to be interested in you .
good acting but the story line was lacking . depressing story about very flawed people . no redeeming features to movie . no reason to feel good about watching it .
i liked it was not great but good i liked the story but it is classic serial of the time
these are both funny movies . package came in condition as promised and on time . would recommend these movies for a good laugh .
these guys did such a good job in the first sherlock holmes i could n't pass up this one . they are so funny together and play off of each other so well .
this is a great show . but is coming to an end , glad i bought it i do not think the story line could have cast a better cast of actors
another disney winner , family fun and full of laughs . this is what today 's movies should be like instead of the junk being put out now . highly recommend the seller for service .
it was good to watch it after not seeing it in the long way i think it is another good movies
war horse is a great movie . i loved it . great story ... great movie . worth the money ! cried several times ... for the characters , and the horse : (
this series brings back many memories from when i was growing up in the 50 's . the music is terrific and many of the scenes are incredible .
i loved every season of the west wing . it was as good at the end as it was at the beginning . love this show !
happy with the movie . its been years since i have seen this ! i would recommend to anyone that grew up in the 80 's : )
great spoof very funny -- it was meant to entertain -- it does ! saw it on tv then bought it .
one of my all time favorites . perfect to watch with anyone . since horses are my passion , this was right up my alley . recommend it for anyone .
if you like the scary movies this one is well worth watching . i liked it alot !
great movie . great service by vendor . it arrived sooner than expected and in great shape . a pleasure doing business with the vendor .
i am a huge tim allen fan . while this movie is not his best - in my opinion - it still is very much worth owning and sharing with friends .
this is an entertaining movie and a good western . you should enjoy it provided you have not the least interest in historical accuracy .
great movie . bought it for wife and she absolutely loves it . great price also . would buy more if they are all that price
i loved this movie as a kid and i still love it as much as an adult . my children love it too ! good family movie . : )
having watch sets one through seven so far , i can say the quality of the stories are great and i look forward to the last two with anticipation .
this was a cute movie ! it 's great to watch a movie the whole family can enjoy together ! you should see it !
how could anyone go wrong on owning old classic movies like tarzan . this is an excellent boxed set .
is a cool movie to watch , pretty funny and a light comedy i recommend it
still loved revenge of the fallen . a bit long in parts , but kept true to the story .
this is without a doubt , one of the funniest movies of all time ! you will laugh if you have a sense of humor !
a good amount of realistic action , characters are believable , and it can be watched and enjoyed by any one of any age .
it is a very good family movie and it was very appropriate for this christmas season . i recommend it for families every where .
wonderful movie . all members of the family will love . easy to download digital copy . packaging was easy to open . great for the library
what a great combo pack for christmas . my son was so excited to get & # 34 ; exactly & # 34 ; what he was asking for christmas !
i had not heard about this movie before but really like it should see it you like it i am sure
soft but easy to tear . it works on my ball of foot but does not last long which is the problem with this product .
i have all the step up movies and this one in 3d is the best of the bunch for the music and the dancing !
i chose this rating because it 's one of those scary movies you can actually see happening . it was n't over the top but very well done .
if you want the original release dont buy this . dont be a nerd , send the fat man a message . spend your money on star trek if you have to .
this movie had to much sex based subject matter , as a matter of fact that was basically the subject of this movie .
such a great comedy love movie . tom hanks and meg ryan are at it again in this great movie . & # 60 ; 3
i adore this movie . this is one of the few disney classics , young and old can enjoy it . took me back to being a kid again .
i had not seen the movie in theaters and just thought it sounded like it would be a good movie . i really enjoyed it more than i expected and have recommended it to several other people .
we bought this movie to complete our harry potter collection . great movie at a decent price so we 're happy with our purchase .
i love gunsmoke and always have ! my husband and i watch it almost every night . more shows should be made like gunsmoke !
my son loves this series of movies he does n't like scary he watches this and gets a kick out of it . clean family movie for halloween
i liked the story line and would watch it again sometime in the future . my husband liked it as well .
funny but stupid . there is no plot and nothing makes sense besides the fact that each scene has its own laughs .
i love one tree hill and the third season is my favorite season ! i loved it ! awesome show ! awesome season ! ; )
this is such a great little movie , we have watched it over & over so many time , every one will like it too . thanks
even though the story does n't mean much , it is always a pleasure to watch tom hanks and meg ryan , especially when they are young .
this is a great movie . a must have if you do n't already have it . on blu-ray the picture is perfect .
this movie is amazing . i watched it once and then decided to buy myself a copy of the movie . great for anyone !
loved it . difficult to watch at times due to the illness and battles people had to endure just to receive treatment , but an excellent movie .
i am not a good reviewer for this product . it did not hold my attention for 15 minutes . the end .
an okay movie . it could have been better . the acting was fine but it is definitely not a family movie .
excellent story . plenty of action . very realistic special effects . gives an excellent accurate account of how the war was fought .
this dvd has 4 of my favorite jimmy stewart westerns . it was sent quickly & i am very happy with it .
this is such a heartbreaking story ; at times it was difficult to watch . angelina jolie at her best ! highly recommended .
a way to escape to a different world and go on adventure . the characters are wonderful and there is lots of action .
one of my 5 top movies of all time . and # 1 as of the present . what an amazing piece of work !
addicting ! good balance of interesting plot with equally interesting characters . finished season two and started 3 .
great movie and very entertaining . it makes you feel as if u were there . i recommend that you watch this movie . great
i really loved this movie a lot . i am into historical and military movies very much . i have been always fascinated about early u.s. history .
great cast . good flick . fun plot with some twists . ending was lacking , but the movie is really worth it . see for yourself .
watched this movie when it first came out , so glad to have been able to add it to my collection . awsome movie
you have to see the movie . it will make you think what will you do if ! you were in there shoes . period
i have my own copy now and so does my sister . it 's well done and the actors are great . thanks
great movie ... with a twist at the end , that i did not expect ... . i recommend watching adding this movie to your & # 34 ; watch & # 34 ; list .
good children 's story , but it contains a lot of scenes that get very loud at times .
this is a dog . i could not stay with it . i tried 3 times . it is just to slow . it feels like a stage play not a movie .
i like watching show . i enjoy being able to watch television shows when i want . i am looking forward to getting the second season soon .
fell in love with morse years ago and have so enjoyed seeing lewis come into his own . love that they mention morse from time to time and influence he had on lewis . can watch over and over .
did n't get to watch the whole movie wife did n't like the foul language so we changed to a different movie
watched the entire movie but there were a few times i thought about turning it off . i like kurt russell but for some reason did n't care for this movie much .
good good good good good it was good i liked it why does this require so many words my goodness
i had been looking for this series since i read about the european version . now i ca n't wait for # 3 to be available on dvd !
i found this movie to be exciting and very captivating . i could n't pull myself away from the movie . i had to see what happened next . i would recommend this movie to everyone .
i highly recommend this movie . i had never heard of this movie and took a chance on it . it was worth it for sure .
very good special effects . worthwhile . great twist at the end . lots of violence so be prepared . but hey , its thor .
adult audiences and then it is a tough story , very haunting . superb acting ! much better than the us version , by far .
sort of has that million dollar baby feel about it , but nonetheless still a good movie , i liked it anyway
this has always been one of my favorite movies and i just love having it for my own and it 's just what it was advertised to be .
if you enjoy futuristic flicks , these are the greatest ! hope they come out with another series . the way it ended , they could !
the cd arrived in a timely manner and in very good condition . i gave it as a gift and they really enjoyed it . so i recommend it highly .
great product and i received quickly havent watched it yet but i have seen it before that why i bought it i loved it
danny kaye has always been a great actor and comedian . as far as my personal opinion , this is his very best !
i wanted to see this from the first trailer . usually movies like that disappoint me , but this was the exception . i dare you not to fall in love with emma watson in this movie .
i love this show . ever since i started watching it it 's always been hilarious . one of the funniest shows i 've ever seen
this is a great movie , but make sure you see that it is not region 1. other than that , it is perfect
it is a beautiful film with different stories of each member of a family , fantastic actors of first quality . i 'm waiting for a fourth season soon .
i hoped this movie would be at least acceptable but also thought that the weekend special price made it okay to stop watching if it was not so good . it was really good and the cast was fantastic .
this is one of my all time favorite shows and i have almost every season on dvd . this was a must have for my collection and i highly recommend purchasing it .
this was a good movie but i did not like the end , it was maybe alittle confusing and it let open some questions of is this real or a dream .
this cartoon was great - funny , heartwarming , great dialog and voice cast was cool . i enjoyed it almost as much as `` despicable me '' . would definitely recommend to both kids and adults alike .
since friends , there has n't been another show like this . i would recommend everyone to see the series if they have n't already .
love this movie , although as a child i was really scared by it . watched it recently with my 9 year old , she loved it as well .
this movie is so hilarious ! im a big will ferrell fan and he keeps showing me why ! this was too funny
bought this and other classics to add to our collection . great price ... no shipping ! ! we 're very pleased .
i love this show . i am really glad i purchased this box set and when theres nothing great on tv on a rainy day these dvds come really in handy .
i bought this for a gift , so i sure hope she loves it . it is right up her alley , funny & christmas .
this is a story of 2 people who are truly i love in real life . i enjoyed hearing their story ! i highly recommend it !
i do n't think so . this was not really funny at all , even though i love steve carell . must have been one of his first
not since the blue brothers has one viewer had so much fun watching a film . it was almost like watch a live action cartoon .
& # 34 ; got ta watch & # 34 ; movie . denzel acting , always makes you believe his characters . keeps you interested , was surprised at the end as well
i just started season 2. if you like sci-fi you then this is for you . it can be corny at times but that is what makes it fun .
kids love it i love it : - ) besides it giving me some piece of mind while they watch this movie i must say i enjoy it as well even though they watched it over 30 times .
horrible horrible horrible horrible horrible ! i did not make it through five minutes . hoping for a nice romance ; instead , got nudity .
this is my all time favorite movie , makes me so happy everytime i watch it , it got it all funny sweet and a very important message .
this was a good way to kill a few hours but it was n't a great movie . i was expecting something closer to rush hour type humor .
picture quality was awful and it was so dated , that i just did n't want to waste my time watching it .
this is a great movie . i 've always loved it from the first time i saw it in the theatre . now my children love it . a great storyline that is fun and exciting .
did not hold my interest . the sound would go up then down , making it hard to hear and understand . it got frustrating .
this movie is one my wife could watch every week . the storyline is very good and the cast is remarkable .
robert downey jr did a very good job in this sequel . you will not be disappointed . no issues with the product itself .
i am a big fan of matthew mcconaughey and he did an excellent job in this movie . it was written for him in my opinion . great plot and storyline making it a great movie .
this is always a favorite . it is funny and fun yet touching . tom hanks does not disappoint in this film
great movie ! lots of action ! thought it has a good story line to it as well . loved the story in general .
if you like doris day , this is one of the most enjoyable . in my opinion she should have made more movies with garner . this is a fun movie .
it was an ok movie . nothing special ... a good performance from the rock ... but an enjoyable way to spend an evening of tv watching .
loved it , took a while to find a copy of this and i really enjoyed it .
i love dc . comics i 'll give this a 5 star . i like everything and i would recommend this to everybody . thank you .
i appreciate the fact that the story does not end so quickly . it is still very good . see it for yourself
nice concert but i like the earlier ones when they were younger and had more fire . songs are always memorable but give me a concert in the 70s .
both actors did a fine job of this ! loved the title song ! made during the best times for film producing ! such a great storyline !
those gorgeous faces . that kiss , the most famous in cinema history . one of the 100 all-time best films . perfect role for elizabeth taylor at that point in her career .
i love to hear my teenage grandson laughing as he is watching these videos . he loves them . it was a good choice .
our 2 grandchildren laughed so hard and really enjoyed this comedy . they watched it 2 days in a row and i must admit , i laughed right along with them .
i bought this as a birthday gift , for someone , who was looking for it , and could n't find it . she love 's it , she has already watched it 3 ( three ) times .
one of my favorites as a kid , great to be able to watch an episode when ever i have the time .
lots of action , good vs evil . a real story line . the good guys win ! a real good movie to watch with a big bowl of popcorn .
yeah . i got this movie because i love it . hilarious . bullock is such a great actress , and the script is very well written .
this movie is garbage . do n't think because there is a pretty girl on the front that this is anything you 'll like . actually , it 's probably one of the worst movies i have ever seen .
great romance , suspense , action , crime , and mystery movie ! ! ! ! has a great storyline , a few surprises and funny lines that kill !
we watch this every christmas season . everyone in my family loves it . it is not only funny , it also has the heart of the christmas season .
you have to get this ! its funny , cute , romantic , and guys theres fighting ! lol what more could you ask for ? buy it !
randolph scott is a favorite of mine . the story line is very good . just enough suspence to keep you watching . pause is a must when you leave the room . family can watch this movie..
unfortunately , if the christ were to return today , this is what would probably happen ... not ! it would be nice ! a delightful movie !
i thought this movie had an interesting plot . i did n't like the sad ending . but overall , i thought it was good .
very enjoyable and brings me back to those simple childhood days . i so appreciate being able to purchase these . thank you !
this is a great concert . all of roy 's classics are here . the sound and picture quality are great . this is a good addition to any music lovers collection .
they are fun action films about the mummy ... .not much more to say really . nice special effects .
my dad is a huge star trek fan and i knew this was the perfect gift to buy him for christmas ! he watched it all in one day .
a great combination of sci fi thriller and some comedy thrown in . this is the first time i watched this move and i loved it .
i got this movie because i was told it was good . it was alright , i guess i just was n't in the mood for it .
colin firth is the reason i gave the movie 4 rather than 3 stars . there are some unusual plot twists that give the film more style than otherwise .
this is an excellent dvd and i received it before the expected date and in excellent condition .
i really enjoy this series , but always miss the weekly show . i can not wait for the next season to go on sale .
what can i say about the lion king ? this is something i remember watching in my childhood days . always a treat to watch after 20 years . great buy !
ca n't go wrong with elmo ! my 2 year old loves this as an addition to his elmo halloween collection . we watch it all year around . we love the songs on it ! great dvd .
i love this movie even though it 's an old movie . it brings back memories of when i was younger and it came out . i still love watching it .
this was a really great movies for it 's time . i would definitely recommend this to lovers of old time movies .
i 'm an avid dancer , and love dance movies . i loved the story and the romance , but loved the dancing even more ! channing tatum is so hot in this movie ! ! !
i recommend this product to all people who love the twilight zone series . it is an awesome set that will make a great gift . how can you go wrong owning every episode .
this one of the best movies i have ever saw , of course i am a big robert deniro fan . i would highly recommend this movie to anyone ! ! !
this is a great movie with a wonderful story ! my three year old daughter loves it !
i love this series plenty of action and drama some funny parts as well . just a simple crime type show
i remember watching this as a kid . it brings back many memories . good movie for the kids to watch . i wish there is more movies of t his on amazon .
one of the best animated films i 've seen . beautifully smart and funny . great for the whole family .
personally expected more , but that just me , others may enjoy this dvd more than i did . short , brief but it brings the main points out .
very enjoyable . my husband and i love the summer wine series . they give us a lot of enjoyment and laughs .
since i am the grandfather to a 10 year old , the movie was not my cup of tea , but my grandson thoroughly enjoyed it . watch it several times .
great movie ! creepy setting and storyline . recommended to all horror fans : ) pop the popcorn and turn off the lights and get for a scary treat . enjoy !
arnold does another fun job and you have fun with him in this movie and its your typical action movie that everyone should love .
bought this for my mom and she watches it over and over again ! she says it is hilarious through the whole series .
while the acting was just so so , it is however a fictional movie about a woman who is a cat - with this said , it is entertaining to watch !
it was a wonderful movie about changing lives and positive choices and letting new experiences happen . very great movie that was based on a true story .
a female cop - flawed ; a tragedy survivor - flawed ; they find each other . did not know i was a romantic until i saw this one . got ta love it .
foyle 's war is a fantastic series . the acting is great . the sets are wonderful . it needs to do more episodes .
great movie , marvel usually does good when it comes to feature films on the big screen . cant wait to buy the sequel soon !
it was good , but i liked the story line from the original better . acting was good too . i think it was worth the rental
given as a gift and it was appreciated . funny series . a lot of actors that will have continued to see over the years .
this is a very funny video and if you like comedy you have got to get this one .
i really wanted to like this series but could n't even force myself to finish the first episode , the acting was way over the top and just did n't do it for me .
it is good movie but a lot of talking and explaining from start to end , and not as i hope for . but it is very informative and interesting .
this was a good movie with the older , more mature shirley temple . she was a beautiful young lady back then .
even though it is my least favorite in the series it is still one i watch every two years or so .
so very enjoyable . this was made so interesting and about so many different horses and people . very well done . i want more of these .
i was so glad to help my neighbor out with finding a movie he wanted he is n't comfortable online so i ordered this for him thanks
love the old westerns , thanks for a great movie , i will be buying as they are provided from this source .
saw the first season just wonder how it ended . it was ok. high school girls or horse lovers . not a western .
there are many laughs in this movie ... . with lots of great acting ! ! ! entertaining , cute , sweet and funny ! worth the rental !
i think this is more interesting both visually and from a storyline perspective than the & # 34 ; other & # 34 ; original spiderman movie . certainly more action , and a little more of an edge .
i am still watching it over and over . great all around but i hope they will come out with a sequel to it soon .
i saw this movie before and it is good enough to see again . it is funny and poignant and just plain fun to watch .
ca n't we get these songs in cd audio as extras ? ? oh , well ...
good movies , love super hero and outer space movies . love that these movies have humor and mystery 's that need solving .
this movie based on a true story , is entertaining , surprising and well acted . we will enjoy watching it more than once and having friends over to enjoy as well .
i sat down and watched this last night and i was surprised at how cute it was . typical jennifer aniston flick . chick flick . it moved quickly and was amusing .

it didnt get any better than the original saw edge of your seat stuff . no game - must see . love this film
i enjoyed this movie but it has a lot of corny songs . it 's a has a good plot that 's very entertaining .
this entire series is very interesting and thought provoking . this particular dvd is great for either adult study or for teens .
i 've always enjoyed vin diesel , so i enjoyed this movie . it 's definitely different , so if you do n't enjoy sci-fi , do n't buy this movie . it 's definitely action-packed .
just love the movie , seen it over 10 times but will never tire of it ... so good . blu ray is great .
i really love this movie ! it 's got the action , but more than that it has the humor . great storyline ... a classic !
this combo dvd , blue ray , digital is easy to use and understand and comes with a ton of extras . and it even works with itunes .
i saw this movie on television last year and really enjoyed it . sarah jessica parker does a great job in her character . i cried at the end .
i did not like this movie . i am not sure if it was because it was outdated humor because it was released so long ago .
good romance , comedy movie , me and my daughter just love watching this together . recommend this one . great performance by drew barrymore one of her best .
the shirley temple collection is an awesome dvd collection of some of her movies with part of them colorized and the balance in black and white .
buy this ! it is one of the best something weird titles out there . all three movies on this dvd are great and go together perfectly . the trailers are hilarious . worth the money .

im a james bond fan and love the movies and watching them during the winter when i cant get outside or go anywhere .
have been wanting to get this movie for awhile to add to my disney movies . i love the animated movies ! great family entertainment .
it was very funny to watch and really entertaining , it kept me laughing from begining to the end of the movie .
cinderella is a classic what else do i need to say . i loved it has a child and my children love it . i still love to see it .
i really enjoyed this movie and have watched it several times . matt damon is excellent and i am not normally his biggest fan .
this movie is so funny , the monsters are cool . and the way they get them is really silly but to the point of being funny . recommend this one
good flick . good to be able to see it again . nice clean clear copy . good quality . really enjoyed the movie when i first saw it .
this had so much to offer in adult humor and fantasy , kids or adults could enjoy , i watched it 3 times , light hearted ,
even if westerns are not your thing , and they are n't mine , you got ta see this if you like jack at all !
i would recommend this movie . it sad at times , but so sweet also . the actors really make you believe their pain .
i love this movie because i enjoy listening to gospel music and i really enjoyed the storyline . this film is good for all ages .
2 for acting and 3 for story still an enjoyable family movie which may seem a little outdated when watched today .
this is a great movie enjoyed enjoyed , i have it on vhs but wanted it on dvd great picture on dvd good quality great actors , actresses love all the stars , please buy you will enjoy it .
we rented this video when our granddaughters ( ages 5 and 11 ) came to visit for the weekend and everyone watched it including grandpa . it was funny and smart like cartoons use to be .
how did this film get so many stars ? boring , bad acting and same old tired story . great for 15 year old kids , maybe . i turned it off after an hour . just awful .
we did not get introduced to this show until the third season . we then had to buy all three seasons and it is easy to see why folks have become addicted to it . excellent .
if you liked the first one , you will certainly get a kick out of the sequal ! funny from beginning to the very end credits ! ! enjoy !
this was one of mcconaughey 's best movies in my opinion . it was very thought provoking . i would recommend it to anyone .
love these movies and how realistic they make time traveling . we watch the set every few months and always enjoy them !
it was such a strange and evil movie . i wish they focused more on the demons , they really stole the show .
never knew jim could act so good . made the story line good enough to keep you entertained . good movie for family night .
we purchased this movie as it is rarely shown on tv . it is a very funny movie and jerry lewis is hilarious ( which he is in all of his movies ) .
love tom selleck ! i just love this movie it has a great story line and cute actors . never gets old !
emma stone was great in this . it 's a fun movie , not just for teenagers . i liked the parents and it had its funny moments .
funny as expected from chase , i have only watched one of them so far and it was good . not as good as christmas vacation but still good .
just a wonderful series ! my wife and i watch alot of british comedies and this is really top self . a very funny show !
this is an incredible film so different from what i have ever seen ... i keep finding myself in suspense wondering what will develop at every turn ... . really neat !
ca n't hollywood be more creative ? seems that it is the same subject over , and over again ... they make too many movies that are too predictable .
its okay , nothing very special , i was disappointed it was not better , did seem like sherlock holmes movie to me
just not my style at all . watched it on recommendation from someone who enjoyed it immensely , but i could not get into it . maybe you will , maybe .
i like all science fiction and or action movies that have to do with greek mythology . the story line is so much different to the other films having to do with the greek gods about the titans !
did n't think much of it but just wanted to watch a movie . it 's visually beautiful at times , and acting we pretty good from some names i did n't recognize .
another remake of an old movie . did enjoy it and the plot twists were different than the original and the special affects are very good .
i never saw the show when it was on tv , but enjoyed watching the series years later . my favorite part of the show is getting to see hawaii !
i loved it . i will definitely watch this again , many times . i can only say that about a few movies .
i love batman and i was so excited to get all three movies together and for an excellent price ! ! the packaging was great and the movies as described .
i loved this one . all the characters were so good . it 's action packed for sure . kept me very entertained to the end .
good acting , on all the movies , definitely worth what i paid for it . good addition to my collection of movies .
very moving . just so hard to even imagine . happy ending but very hard to believe they all lived . bring tissues .
i liked it and i was entertained but i believe it lacked a lot of suspense and it was a little over the top and it 's ending was not believable but then hey , it 's hollywood .
clean good fun , suspenseful and has you on the edge of your seat in parts . definitely recommend for family viewing .
this a great movie . the actors are spectacular . the determination that the main character has to get closer to the man she loves is so moving . the movie is captivating .
bought it for my hubby for father 's day . it 's one of the oldie movies that he just loves it . he loves all the oldies !
ca n't get enough of this ; i loved watching it on tv when they used to play it each year . this is one classic owning is a must
good film for the whole family . some romance and drama which may bore the children a bit , but otherwise lots of action .
i 'm not into all the vampire and werewolf stuff , but this is totally different . i love the movies , so going to read the books
while this movie does n't follow the written story of the hobbit to the letter , i think what they 've done is very good and i look forward to seeing the next part .
these two are so funny together . i love mr. butler . i am so happy i added this movie to my collection .
great box set , does n't have the last crappy movie as a part of it . arrived in less than a week , much faster then expected .
great movie , great actors ! i really liked ashley judd and tommy lee jones together . do n't remember any other movie that they play in together . hope they have another one .
grandchildren from 4 to 8 loved this and watched it over and over and over and over and over and ... .. it is amazing how many times they will watch this .
i love this movie . the acting my sarah , bette and kathy is so hysterical . the movies entertains me to no end . i watch it several times a year , especially at halloween !

my wife loves the f & f movie series . and she absolutely had to have this movie and was glued to it through the end .
love that movie , have n't seen it in years ! it was good to see it again . definitely gon na order this movie .
this movie is a fun , cult classic ! if you have n't seen it , it is worth it to get it because you will watch it again .
i really do n't get into movies like this it was bought as a gift for my daughter , so i do n't really know how to rate something like this .
it was not very different from other zombie movies , but it was entertaining . glad i saw it on prime and did n't pay to see in a theater .
maybe i missed it , but i ca n't give this video a higher rating , it was not a glued to the edge of my seat kind of move
even after all these years it 's still a great show ! it 's even better not having to watch commercials with it .
i was happy to be able to get this season . i really enjoyed every episode here . it was totally worth buying .
i am glad this was one i rented and did n't buy . dont really get it being so scary as a kids movie , the kids were n't too thrilled with it either
the only reason i watched this movie was to keep up with the previous sequels but as sequels go they were n't as good as the first but not totally boring either .
if you remember a better , easier time , when performers could actually sing , and had talent , then you will love this series collection ... worth checking out for sure .
i really loved this movie a lot . i am into historical movies very much . i am still amazed the still have n't found her yet .
myself and my kids loved this the first time we saw it . the darkness of the movie keeps you engaged .
one of the great classic comedies of all time . the dvd presentation is flawless . it 's unfortunate there are no extras .
at the time of seeing this film i was a mel gibson fan and a goldie hawn fan . but ... .. words fail me .
i have n't seen this yet but i will eventually . i think christmas movies are my very favorite type of movies and i like to see them at various times throughout the year .
bought this for my 10 year old grandson who plays basketball . he really liked it and nothing inappropriate for his age as i can remember .
i seen this movie on the hallmark channel i really like it that why i got i would tell every one to see this movie
i bought this movie for a friend whose daughter said that this was her favorite of all the barbie movies .
good vintage video for a gift to our granddaughter and her family . saw many years ago and remembered it again .
it was as good as the original and also is good for all ages and worth watching over again . great
so glad to finally get these 2 dvd 's of the movie and all the extras . got the movie on time and i like the dvd case and how it holds both dvd 's in place .
a movie got to be really good to keep my attention and this movie held its own ! buy it and i promise that you wo n't have any regrets ! ! ! ! ! !
this is a marvelous series . original and with humor . great character development and gets one thinking about possibilities . you need to start at the beginning in order to understand what is happening .
sorry - have not seen it yet - so ca n't comment now - but i trust it should be good .
my 11 year old loves spooky stuff these are great cause if my younger kids see too bits not too spooky
this is a fine hitchcock film , with cary grant and grace kelly at their best . story is exciting and has humor as well as adventure .

while i am not familiar with the super heroes , i enjoyed this movie . it should have been 30 minutes shorter .
i have always loved this show and have missed watching it . i know they show reruns on tv , but i like seeing them in order . it was such a great family show .
truly the best horror movie i have seen in a long time and it makes you think
there are some movies that are so brilliantly portrayed that all you need is to hear or read the title and you know you will be hooked . this is one of these films .
the package came in good conditions . as we expected the movie keep us still in front of our tv . excellent quality .
this wasnt only a good horror , and had actual depth to each character . thats all .
i 've been waiting for this movie to come on cable forever . it finally came on soap network a few weeks ago . very good
i thought i was going to watch a tom cruise movie , but was quickly surprised . i watched about 15 minutes of it , then moved on . could be of interest to a different audience .
this movie is really funny . kids will love it . this movie was made for family enjoyment . the movie is not just for kids , adults will find it very funny also .
this was a good movie that definitely surprised me . it was not what i expected , but definitely has that comic book feel . if you are curious check it out , i was not dissapointed .
the man is still kicking it . there is a lot of action in comedy as well as arnold 's one liners he 's known so well for

i was very impressed with this movie ! i love the shrek movies , and this one certainly delivered on my expectations .
acting was superb ... story line was very real for those of us that lived through it . i enjoyed it very much .
pierce brosnan is a favorite . i enjoy pictures involving nature . they are not real and only a story . good job .
this movie had it all . excellent singing , love story , good story line , and tons of humor . check this one out .
the movie okay to comic book and cartoon persons and put them into to a real life movie was a great idea , but the scripted could of been a little better .
i am really enjoying this season , good story line great talent . good strong woman characters that all are not trying to look 19
i have just seen the one episode , but i did enjoy it very much . it is very clear and the actors and actresses are all doing a wonderful job . i intend to watch the entire series .
best movie yet with an all star cast . we loved this movie . funny . i might purchase it to watch again .
what can i say , this movie is just plain fantastic ! the acting is awesome all around . watched it twice and will watch it again .
the story line was good , entire movie could have been done in 30 to 45 minutes rather than long and drawn out .
came with no problems . have used this vendor numerous times . this is a great movie ! really enjoy watching it with family
this was close to following the book . the acting was very good . worth watching . i did prefer reading the books . which i read in order and they were amazing .
i thought this story line was completely ridiculous , did n't enjoy the acting and could n't even finish it . this one just was n't for me .
we enjoyed this movie which had a very fast pace . the characters were excellently portrayed . the villain was portrayed very well through the entire movie .
i loved it and ca n't wait for season two ! the acting was good the story line was great , has something for everyone ! looking forward to season two should be fantastic !
the way the actors interact with each other , and the beautiful way each scene develop is amazing ! , a must watch !
this is a great movie with some great stars and a great western star glenn ford . please some release this movie on dvd .
you ca n't go wrong with boris karloff , if your a fan of his movies this is one for your collection , you wo n't be sorry .
i love this movie . has an all star cast and keeps you on the edge of your seat . the ending is a real mind blow as well . great story and well done movie .
good but the others were better i think . love robert he is a favorite to watch anything he does , i see
this is a great collection , a must have for any rocky fan ! the movies look amazing in blu-ray and the case is really cool .
this is the greatest show to ever get canceled . i swear that everything i love on tv gets the boot , and all the crap i do n't gets at least 7 seasons .
i love all these movies . i love romance movies that have a good plot . all of these plots were very different also which keeps them interesting .
this was a movie that was picked by mistake but at the end it turned out to be a good one to make
having grown up with these super heroes , the video brought back many memories . i have passed the video to my grandson .
surely do hope that i have ordered this for what i have been able to catch on tv is grand . maybe i can find the original purchase somewhere .
this movie was funny , entertaining and good for all ages . wish i could have gotten it in 3d , gave the dvd to my grandchildren .
i think this movie is the best one to watch because it is better than the johnny depp version called charlie and the chocolate factory
suspenseful , at a good pace , well acted . leaves you thinking at the end ! !
love friday the 13 , hated this movie . it does not have enough death scenes and lacks suspense
one again jerry showed how creative and talented he was especially the scene in the board room . no one can beat his talent for comedy .
i really enjoyed family matters when it was originally on the air . i hope they come out with the rest of the seasons on dvd soon . fun show !
this is definitely not what i expected . i should have read the buyer reviews more carefully ! be sure you read the description and reviews , to make sure you want this film .
but this movie sucks . it 's not like the other tinker bell movies at all . this was a no no for me .
jude law and katherine jones were rock stars in this one ! i waited for it to come out and it as worth the wait
i thought that the story was ok. it seemed a little unreal that men would pay to play with a sleeping girl and also pay to die by the girl .
ordered this movie in blu-ray and it looks wonderful on the big screen . had it on regular dvd , and wanted to see it in blu-ray . definitely recommend it .
excellent series . can not wait for the next season . fast moving with good character development . would have completely missed it if not for amazon
another movie i saw as a child . also have the dvd . really makes you think hard about the possibilities of being born evil .
one of the best pictures i have seen in awhile . good actors and good acting . take the time to see it .
this is a must see movie . it has lots of life lessons and of course robert duvall is a great actor . inspirational !
this is my daughters favorite movie . i bought it for her . she loves the movie . all in all it is a good movie .
this is a good family movie and has very good bad guy family guy change of heart content . it is all around a good movie .
this movie left me wanting more . the surprise at the end for sandra bullock from mccarthy was unexpected and appreciated .
this was a very heart warming movie . eddie murphy shows again that he can indeed act . i enjoyed this movie a lot .
i really enjoyed this movie and i have the ` original movie and it stays real close to the orginal movie .
this movie is just plain fun . it is a nothing special plot , just light , entertainment that is very well executed .
this is what a super hero movie should be i enjoyed it i would not buy the dvd if i did not like it .
i 've always liked this movie and now can watch as many times as i want to since you do n't see it on tv anymore
this movie was intriguing , but i was left with more questions than answers . i found it hard to keep up with the storyline , but that could have been me .
a great and superior family narrative about struggles they go through both as individuals and as a family
tyler perry always know how to entertain and teach a lesson all in one line ! good movie and funny . will watch again
tom and jerry are their favorite . they enjoyed this dvd while riding in the car . i could hear them laughing the whole time .
this movie is n't very good so do n't waste your money because it is a 2nd rate movie , is the way i see it .
was a lot better than i expected . good enough to buy . not your average ordinary movie . i would recommend watching it .
i loved watching this show ! a must watch for those that enjoy suspense and/or zombies . the characters are well developed despite being an action filled series .
this movie is just beautiful . beautiful story , funny , sad , and so real . beautifully written . steve martin is amazing . and it wrote the story too !
this isnt as good as the originals nobody can do the original guy so you might not like it as much butt if its first time seeing pink panther you might laugh your head off .
it is a great love story . you will cry you eyes out and then want more . it has a good story .
i thoroughly enjoyed this movie . i would recommend it to anyone . i think it is worth watching more than once .
this blue ray disk has a good story line and quality computer animation . the sale price was a very deal .
24 has it fans for a reason , the suspense , the action , and the twists and turns are well developed . i am glad to see it return again this year .
if by chance you believe in heaven and hell , this movie is spooky ! especially if you watch it by yourself !
heartwarming and you believe in your fellow man and that there is good in people and sometimes money is not that important
this is a wonderful christmas show , its timeless , with 2 of our greatest singers .
best of all of the twilight movies . the direction in this one was so much better than with the past movies .
this was a disappointment . the same old story played in the same old way boring me half out of my mind .
i had n't seen this movie in many years - i am so pleased to see it again and share it with younger friends who never knew how great hepburn and bogart were in this movie .
even after watching this movie over 30 years after it hit the movie theater , it 's still a great hit . every sequence is worth watching over and over again . bruce we miss you .
this is a great movie . it arrived only 1 day late , but around christmas time i expect that . i have no complaints .
there is nothing i can say about this movie that has n't already been said . it is one of the few young adult comedies that is actually funny instead of being just plain stupid .
i loved this movie . i have seen it many times over the years but it was not on dvd yet . i was so glad to finally have a copy of it .
this workout will get you going and you will have alot of fun doing it too . this dvd is very good and i would say get this one a try . and go ahead have some fun !
i found this movie to be rather good , a little slow , but good . i 'd recommend it to most anime fans .
i enjoyed this movie when it first came out , and after all this time i still find it interesting and well worth watching .
this movie was funny , romantic and it had a very good message ! i will watch this movie over and over again .
last season and left me wanting more ... wonder if the sopranos were taking away the viewers . needless to say , the sopranos can be seen on amazon prime too ! ! !
this is an easy movie to watch over and over again . it is cute and funny . the humor is clean and family appropriate .
i brought this movie for my mama , and likes it very well . radio is a very touching movie for the whole family member who are from ten and up .
katherine hepburn , cary grant , and james stewart were at their best ! they were all charming in this funny , lovable movie . enjoy !
if you love zombie movies this is a must see ! brad pitt and all the cast was excellent . book and movie are both worth the time ...
we have watched all in the series . truly worth every minute ... you will enjoy the whole series ... worth your time , for sure
i added this film to my collection and i will be purchasing the third and final film also . ca n't wait !
awesome . if you loved this series you must get this dvd set . you will not regret it one moment .
great adaptation , i 'll always prefer the anime but really well done for a live action movie . i like the different ending as well , made it extremely interesting to watch .
it started out okay , a bit overly predictable but watchable . it was n't too bad but i would not watch again .
just watch it . the deleted scenes to be included in this dvd are supposed to be great . funniest movie in a long time .
another family classic . a must have for the holidays . george scott was great as playing scrooge . a great family movie with substance .
i love this show and the price was great for it being the most recent when i bought it . the case for the dvds was a little worn but the discs work great , no skipping .
it keeps you wanting more . i look forward in purchasing the rest of the series well done thank you love it
check this movie out . you do n't know what to expect until it hits you right on the face . you wo n't be disappointed .
like all the harry potter books this also has a lot of action and a good ending . the whole series gets a huge 2 thumbs up .
this movie is not as good as the others of freddy and jason but i wanted the whole collection
an outstanding book and an outstanding movie . even i , a grown man , who has seen almost everything wanted to cry .
if you have ever seen any of these movies before , this is the way to own all three in one package at a great price with much better english subtitles .
watched this movie with my grandkids and we all loved it . from the time the movie started , nobody moved . it was great !
the second season was great and of course led to the movie . needed a third season and maybe a fourth .
content of the movie it 's self a little dry . not his best work . try , try again . oh well running out of inspiration .
i love the series , l hope they continue the series . it is one of my favorites . i wonder if there will be a seven season ... .
i loved the movie it just so sad of whats its all about things be happening & you do n't know anything about
the waltons was my favorite tv show when our children were growing up . i am delighted to be able to see all these shows again .
i absolutely love the whole series , the actors are very good and seem to love their job . it almost seems real !
i had already seen these 2 movies & enjoyed them . great price ... thanks for this great offering , especially at christmas time .
somehow i remembered it as much better when i watched it on tv years ago .
way too slow of a start . thought val was okay , but come on let 's explain the story a bit more . too many characters to start . stopped after about 30 : minutes .
what a great show . so enjoy the ole good movies . the pure and innocent , no cussing , no swearing , just good movies
i thought this was a great movie anyway , in hd it 's even better .
well written and acted , with great scenery , good action and a wonderful ending . just the movie for a snowy saturday afternoon .
this is a different type of scifi movie . it is mostly just sandra bullock ( who i really like ) , but i did n't really care for this movie .
although i love denzel , i did not like this movie . it was slow , the characters were boring . i am surprised i watched it to the end !
love this movie , after watching it several times on netflix i went looking and found it here for a great price !
michael jackson is the best entertainer the world has ever known . i am glad to own this collection of his talent on film .
this turned out to be a good movie , a little slow at first , but it picked up , kept me entertained
who needs the modern day gore . this movie is creepy . and the woman is so twisted . i love these old suspense thrillers .
a great video for watching what & quot ; the life & quot ; was like in the 50 's era . a nicely done movie .
cute movie with lots of action . good humor and not packed with adult humor . this movie is really made for kids
remember watching this superman series when i was a child . it was amusing . technology has improved over time . thanks for the memories
great movie ; but , was a little disappointed in the poor condition of the dvd case .
hated it ! i couldnt watch more than 20 minutes of it , even with all the a list stars involved .
i watched this with my 13 and 10 year old son and felt the movie was a little to gory too watch with kids . i did not feel that way about the first movie .
no one does nature like the bbc . this ranks right up there with the planet series they also produced . well worth the money .
definitely not as funny as i had expected , but if you can find it for free , it 's worth watching if you have nothing else to do .
gary cooper is great in this movie , very enjoyable . one of the best actors of his time and my favorite .
this is a vhs and i wish it was dvd but still a good story that needs to be remembered .
funny , funny movie ! we loved it -- i 've watched it several times . cate blanchett is marvelous in this .
my husband and i both enjoyed this movie . it was not predictable and was very entertaining . we 'd recommend its viewing !
like ryan reynolds , think he 's funny , and though it made me laugh a couple times , not worth the hour and a half of your life .
good movie , if you like thor 1 you will love thor 2. also if you liked the avengers you will totally dig this one .
how could you not enjoy these two guys . i love both of them and the show is entertaining . love westerns
love debbie reynolds ! ! ! have looked for this movie for the last couple of years . looked on amazon and there it was , so i ordered it .
i enjoyed this movie very much . i almost cried while watching . good movie for young and old . i highly recommend this movie .
do n't waste your time . this is someone 's sick idea of a movie . really ! i had to fast forward through this mess . i guess curiosity got the better of me .
clean for the kids , hysterical for adults ! fun time enjoyed by all , minions are super funny and are worth watching for ! !
i watched this movie with my family and it was very good . you can watch it too and will be happy .
great shows with miss marple would tell people to watch this and buy from this place again if you like mysteries this is the show for you
i bought this dvd for my daughter and she loved it ... i liked this movie.i liked halloween ii i think better , but both were great movies ... .
this is one of those movies that you can watch over and over again . a feel good movie that is one of the best around . i love it .
this movie had a lot of big names , it tried to be a classic , i love hackman , crowe is less than stellar , stone is n't to great , etc .
we are very satisfied due to getting it in a reasonable fast time ! ! ! ! disk and disk cover in good shape ! ! ! ! was able to buy this as a present ! ! ! !
used to watch this all the time growing up . it was great watching these episodes again and remembering all the great jokes and chemistry of the actors . disks were new and box was in great shape .
i bought this one after buying the cardio dance because i enjoyed that one so much . it is fun to do and will definitely help you get your cardio on . i love it ! ! ! ! !
the person that sold this to me was fine , but the movie was not what i thought it would be .
this has been out for many years and it 's still a great movie to watch . the dinosaurs that come to life are great and give a somewhat accurate picture of what they were like back then .
some good fights and some very funny comedy , although once watched a few times begins to wear a little thin . generally a good movie .
arrived fast and is just as described . was so happy to find loved as a kid brought back great memories .
i have always loved this movie and i am so glad that i have it on dvd now ! this movie cracks me up !
this is a really good deal and a really movies to have and enjoy with the family so order a copy
the acting was okay , the filming was decent , but the story was really awful . this was not a film i would recommend but some may find it interesting .
the first season of charlie sheen 's new show is wonderful it shows off mr sheen 's comedic skills and has a wonderful ensemble a must have
a new insight to the man . movie was surprising and entertaining . would recommend this to anyone that has a strong opinion on the man and times . it might surprise you .
as one of favorite movies of all times , i finally own this wonderful copy . now to sit back and enjoy .
i have been a fan of & # 34 ; are you being served & # 34 ; for a while . these is the spin off from that . all i can say is i love every episode .
this was a very interesting and well thought out movie . it shows how the justice system works for black people without money and for black people with money .
explained thoroughly on all seasons , gets better and better and better and funnier ... ..i bought each season of course i love the show .
wore out the vhs years ago . really creepy funny . a great movie to pop in the dvd when people are over and bored to tears cause they have seen everything thats out there .
this is an awsome movie that will have you on the edge of your seat . i would recommend this movie to friends and family .
again john wayne at his best in these three b movies still a bit dated compared with his later a movies but fun to watch .
the movie was completely awesome ! i just ca n't wait for part 3 !
i liked the acting , i did n't like the premise of the thing . its not ok , what she does . the word is love .
amazing i really loved the story and all the characters where amazing and i enjoyed it very much and recommended to everyone who is interesting in that kind of stories
i miss movies that had a good messages along with a little romance and comedy . i miss great actors like this .

good buy the movie i was looking for plus a few more that i had n't seen and really liked and i watch a few times
i 'm not a musical fan but this was very enjoyable . it was colorful and exciting with fun music mixed in .
the story line is good . i enjoyed the book , more in it of course , but the writing was poor . the movie sticks to the clever story line , and is gripping .
a not often seen on tv movie that is as exciting , beautiful to watch , intriguing and entertaining as it was when first released in the movies .
this was a bit drug out for my taste i 'll keep it with my vin diesel movies only because he 's in it
i just wish i had every episode of this wonderful show ! it is never disappointing and always entertaining , plus the gorgeous scenery .
this is a good movie ; it 's sort of fast paced , with a good story line . it 's funny , without being too terribly silly
i love this series . the ensemble cast , the mysteries . i love everything about it . i ca n't wait for season 4 .
my family and i love this tv series . when it was on tv we would hurry home so we did n't miss it ... thank you amazon for bringing it back
very happy to get this dvd , the lead singer has since gone solo . fantastic condition , arrived on time , would order from them again .
i love this movie so much that i watched it over and over again . one of my favorite movies ever . i highly recommend it .
its got it moments and some parts are funny than action and than takes a left and goes into something else all together but all in all its ok , its seems like its part comedy , action ,
if you looking for a lot of laughter , get this movie it 's funny as hell . and also have alot of top actors and comedians .
could n't resist this classic for my collection . no problem with ordering or receiving the product . always great to do business with you .
i know this is supposed to be a classic , but it is awful , unless you are a fan , do n't bother .
dustin hoffman is so funny in this movie . we watch a lot of movies during the winter and this is always great for a lot of laughs .
it contains some scenes that are filled will violence and nudity . i would not recomend it for children . it 's geared more for older people .
i would recommend this to just about any one . the movie kept your attention all the way along and had a very good story .
these films are some of the best , especially for animated movies . we enjoy watching them often and sharing them with our older children . i recommend them to anyone .
i love the disney pirate movie series . i think they are very entertaining and fun . i have the whole set .
will ferrell should not have been chosen to play the leading actor for this movie . nicole kidman did a much better job than he did . the tv series was much better .
i think this is the best comedy movie of this generation . it is absolutely hilarious . if you have not watched it yet . then you need to .
love this christmas movie . definitely adding it to my christmas movie collection . super cute story line . love this movie and would definitely recommend it !
one of my all time favorites ! makes one think of their very first pet and how much you come to love them .
i heard a lot of rave reviews by so many people but found the story line predictable . the scenes themselves were grand and well done . not a bad movie and i 'd watch of again .
i love this movie . tom hanks is adorable in this . all the actors are perfect for the roles that they play . it 's a love story with a very unusual twist .
i bought this movie for my niece and she is super happy with it ! it came exactly as it was described .
there will never be another movie like this one . i 've watched it too many times to count and will watch it that many more .
you ca n't go wrong in buying this boxset . any i love lucy show is worth the $ !
mcconaughey nails this part , everyone in the movie does a great job , very entertaining movie . they need to turn another one of the books into a move ...
some of the sci fi program from my past was good , but i could never get into buck roger like before .
i got this for my son . it 's his favorite series . of course anything with zombies is his favorite . he 's watched it over and over and will continue to do so !
yes and he acts just like he did on his tv show and is just as loveable now as he was back in his own show
one of the most realistic crime films made . the interview with the writer of the book was especially interesting and at the same time , frightening .
this series is like the others . i have enjoyed all of them and have all of them so far . very entertaining .
i love the hair band music from the 80 's and this dvd did n't disappoint . it is super cute but i would n't advise any parent to show this to anyone under 18 .
this is a great action packed movie . will keep you guessing through the whole movie . great to watch with your friends .
robert redford is a great actor , and he is very good in this role . there are few movies that tell a good story and are wholesome in doing so .
this film made the roman army real . history at it 's finest ! wonderful costumes , great color . will watch this again , worth the rental !
this is a good move . show how some people need to watch how they do and act as much what come out of their mouth can do for you
i have seen the movie , and love it , but how can i rate the movie now since i have not received it from you all yet . goofy .
a really good story line . depicts live as it was during the time period . sad but very interesting . held my interest .
it was not the best movie but not terrible . pretty much what i had expected . tears did appear once or twice . good ending and sweet message about believe and not giving up
i usually like hugh grant 's movies , but this one was kinda dumb . i did n't care for the female lead at all .
this movie had more twists and turns than i expected and i was so happy with my rental . it definitely lived up to expectations and i would definitely consider purchasing this movie in the future .
exciting movie - lots of action - acting was very good - jennifer lawrence ( she makes almost any movie worth watching ) .
a funny parody of walk the line , great for a laugh , it 's a very silly movie , love this type of humor
delivery was timely as promised . since the item is a christmas gift , i 've no idea of the quality , but i assume it is as advertised .
i was expecting a more strong story , i felt it a little weak , but i did enjoy the action and part of the story .
this is the best special feature from the lord of the rings special features . the scenery is fantastic . the dvd was in good shape when it arrived and was what we ordered . enjoy !
this was not a good movie , the trailer was better than the movie . the actors were bad , not worth seeing .
john cusack was awesome in this . that was really great . i watch this a lot all the time . they were incredible . loved it .
probably greatest tv show ever . so far ahead of its time . this show set tone for everything scifi that followed
this is the most fun movie with great singing . i watch this over and over for that alone . do n't miss this one . it 's a gem .
overall , just great script , performances , characters . perfect movie , really , no flaws . i love this movie .
funny , funny , funny ! bill cosby had me laughing at the bill cosby show . he is just as funny today . i agree , bill , that you are far from finished .
the movie has the characters that you liked and scenes that are funny . but i did n't like the story . i am not a game player when it comes to relationships so i had lost interest .
i saw it a long time ago . need to pay attention from the beginning otherwise you 'll be missing what it is all about .
a classic of the genre . wanted to view the tv version but needed to catch up first . the dvd was in great shape and arrived promptly .
i ordered this to complete my andy griffith series . love to watch these old shows and the grandkids think they are great .
before super natural , we learned what a lady in white was in this movie . scary enough to hold our attention , innocent enough for the kids . so cute . sad though
the show was the most detailed of any police movie made . the action in it was amazing and very true to life .
season seven was great ! ! back to normal somewhat with the characters and the great stories continue . this season was a great one !
the movie was very enjoyable . i thought it was better than the first one . would recommend to everyone . a great movie for the entire family .
this was a good movie but kinda predictable . it did n't have that magical feeling like disney 's old movies .
this is the stuff of greek tragedy . long after repeated viewings , you find yourself thinking that yes indeed , it is that good . a must . a perfect gift for mother 's day .
good kid movie and adult as well . good story line with a modern ending that is a good message for girls and boys alike while also being a very enjoyable story just to watch .
dvd is good quality just not the best songs to much politics and i did n't notice the rating because there is swearing that surprised me glad no kids were around
my best friend n i love love this movies and she told me to buy it because i would like it and she was right i loved it
i 'd recommend this movie for any night of week . guaranteed to make you laugh ! ! uncle buck is my fav , but they both are wonderful ! ! helps for missing john candy ! !
$ hit ... if you are gon na get one or the other , go with this double pack . need i say more ?
one of my favorite adorable shows , brings back a lot of memories , thank you so much for having it available to me .
this talks about the ghosts of hollywood and marilyn monroe ! sounds like a lot of fun !
worth the watch , moved well , and was a surprisingly adult for a `` children 's '' movie . it may not be suitable for middle school or younger children .
this show is very cute and has a lot of episodes on it . great buy !
i bought the movie for bradley cooper . a very funny and good summer movie with a summer team , of course !
enjoyed everything about this movie . very exciting movie . there are not many movies i would watch twice , but this one i would .
a change from dvd to blue ray in the the underworld collection and in a complete set was a bonus
you could tell this was one of the first ones this is nice i like this format as well as the newer ones .
awesome set . now you can see why harry potter is one of the most enjoyable movie series of all time .
what could be better than ernest at christmas . this is a family tradition to watch this movie every year . love it .
anything john cusack is in is a good movie . this one was no exception . held my interest through the whole movie
this movie was a lot of fun to watch , the whole movie was well written and very enjoyable to spend some time watching
my son told me about the show a few years ago and now we own all the seasons . the special features are good and it 's great to be able to watch the show without commercials .
i liked the plot and the possible ending the movie could have taken . i really enjoyed the idea of making a living like that .
bought this dvd for my 6 year old granddaughter as a christmas gift , my understanding is that she loved it .
the movie in general is super . arnold at his best . the rest of the cast is a bit wooden but that is to be expected .
i hate reading movies but i really liked this one . i would watch it again . great stunts and really entertaining .
this is my favorite version of the timeless classic . i got the special edition for myself and for a friend who simply loves pride and prejudice .
i really love the action in this movie . some of the language however , is a little over the top . the purchasing experience was wonderful . fast shipment and the condition was just as advertised .
it does n't get better than this ... and , yes ! , i believe it 's more & # 34 ; ginger and fred & # 34 ; than the other way around .
this is one of my husband 's favorite shows . it combines his love of scifi with history . the actors are developing their characters well and the scripts are tight .
this is a classic slapstick style comedy . love bill murray in this one . quality of amazon streaming was great . highly recommend .
i love this movie . what a great story . i watch this movie a lot and never get tired of it . the cast and the movie was excellent !
i enjoyed this film . while the ending was predictable , it was enjoyable to watch . the music was great also . i can give this film a good recommendation
we really could n't get into this series . it just started out with so much unnecessary foul language . i will never understand why writers thinks this is what draws a crowd .
i 've been searching for this movie with a good price on it . i was very surprised and happy with the price of this movie . thank you now my husband has the complete set
wish i had known that the pilot episode would be included in the season 1 collection . now i have 2 of the same episode .
classics which i had on vhs and i wanted dvd to last . good quality movies that you will enjoy . john wayne is a hero of the war movies .
this movie collections talks about how a group of people get together for reasons that society puts them together . it shows how together they can overcome anything it comes against them .
this is the spin off series from dr who , just watched the 1st 2 episodes . great entertainment , good quality sets , the 1st of the 2 episodes both had great creatures to be fought !
i bought this as a birthday gift for my boyfriend , he loves it , this is all he ever watches anymore ! !
i do n't even know why this concept was wasted to film ... i want my time back for watching this so called & # 34 ; movie & # 34 ;
i mean , do you need me to tell you why this is good ? it 's toy story , come one , you know you 're going to watch it .
tom hanks is great in any movie he is in . he is so funny . this movie had me laughing until i was almost in tears
just like i remembered the show , it is still a good family show and my youngest daughter enjoyed watching every episode .
purchased for my husband as it is one of his favorite films . not one of my favorites even though it is a christmas classic .
please keep movies like this coming love it prime is becoming one of the best site to watch movies and tv shows
awful , just awful . a waste of time . not humorous . awful ... awful
my son loves all dog movies and this one was n't any different . price was reasonable and he enjoyed it . good .
season 5 has to be the best season . the boys are on fire in this season and as hot as ever . highly recommend ! ! !
this movie was enjoyed even by my husband who usually falls asleep watching dvds . a person could not but like the positive attitude of the young man
this is one of my favorite movies and when i am in the mood for john travolta this is one of my picks .
this was a gift for my friends daughter and she loves to watch this dvd all the time ... would recommend for girls ...
what do you say about the greatest drama series ever made . all seasons a must see .
this is the kind of story you remember and go back to over and over again ... again many thanks , bill
my granddaughter just loves all the animals in this movie , she dances to the music . so worth getting for her . she is only going to be 3
fast delivery great product good price well worth it . i 'm trying to get all of the avengers movies or what i can get .
save your money and time . dont rent this movie ! i was glad i didnt see it in the theaters . what a waste !
i am a huge fan of the predator series ... this movie completes my collection . it takes be back to the original w/ arnold s !
really cute movie even though this plot has been used many times . i think the actors are so charming , that it just works .
i really love the mummy movies , and this blu-ray collection allowed me to get them all at a really good price !
doctor who is a fun and almost corny sci fi adventure ... but in a good way . it 's never slow . i have been enjoying every season so far
this is another movie for your meg ryan library . it will make you cry and laugh but gets the point across !
this dvd has good sound and picture quality . i recommend this blu ray disc to all movie lovers who enjoy a great movie . it has a great story line and very entertaining .
this was an awesome purchase . dvd in the condition stated , and played wonderful . i would buy from this seller again . thank you .
great buy ! this is a very funny movie and great for the whole family ! wo n't stop laughing ! great messages in the movie too .
this is a pretty erotic story with not so bad acting . i would not own it but rent it next time as once is enough
engrossing yet humorous is the best way to describe the complete 7 years , the only thing wrong with & # 34 ; the closer & # 34 ; is there are only 7 seasons .
season 6 could have been better as the story had more potential than what was revealed but , that is not to say i did n't enjoy it immensely . must watch .
love the show , and i 'm happy to have started my collection . also bought greek chapter one . will buy the rest .
another great english comedy ! they really know how to cast a film . enjoyed the film greatly and will watch it over and over .
i really liked this movie ! i bought it for my kids to watch and i ended up enjoying it more . a very classic animated movie , for the whole family . i recommend to anyone !
action packed , typical cage movie . the acting was good could have pick a better person for female lead , but a good movie , enjoyed it .
these were so funny & so good . i 'm glad we got them as we love these old movies . thank you .
i do not care for horror movies but my daughter and husband love them . they were both excited by this purchase .
they could have done more with this . story line was lacking as was the vision . it completes the collection , but i wo n't watch it as much as the others .
loved seeing these two films and being on an led tv and blue ray felt like i was in there with them . great actors , great writing and very believable . two thumbs up !
this show is worth watching . i enjoyed all the actors and the moral lessons . i would watch it again . you generally ca n't go wrong with hallmark videos for family viewing .
i liked season 1 and 2 a little better than this season , but its still a fantastic show and i enjoy it
i do not have much to say of this film but skip it . trust me it is horrible . and all the people that gave this film good reviews definitely doesnt know what a good film is .
laughter , sadness , tears , and triumph ! who could ask for more in a movie ! the wife should really get much credit for the humor in this tale .
a wonderful book was brought to light in film through superb casting . a great job with obvious time and effort put into the making of this movie . a must see .
i always love an oldie . they do not make them like these any more , and it is a real shame , because they are really good .
the two racing personalities were really the theme but the racing scenes were superb . nice work . engrossing film for the human element of what it takes to win taken from different points of view .
this is one of the very best movies i have viewed . it was intense and the acting was excellent . i recommend
great music and excellent and entertaining dancing . acting and story line alright but not great . entertaining and i would buy it again .
i watched these when my grand kids were growing up , so i got the 13 set and sat and enjoyed all of them all over again .
found this movie funny and laughed a lot during the movie.. the actress is good and she adds and bring to life her character .
this movie arrived on time and in excellent condition . this another good movie that like the bar drinking , then some shooting . i would recommend this movie to anyone for purchase .
got this for my daughter . we saw the movie and she has wanted it ever since . she is getting other brave items . this was well packaged , came promptly and was exactly as described .
this movie made me like james bond even more . daniel craig is awesome . lots of action ! buy this movie ! it 's cool !
this was a good movie i gave it 4 stars , i love anything with arnold s. he 's such a good actor i hope he continues making good movies for all of us to enjoy .
we all should take a lesson from tyler perry 's movies . there is always a message in any movie he makes .
of , course , this is a classic , as far as i am concerned , ca n't beat jack lemmon , no matter what he does , he does it well ! ! !
not all that entertaining for anyone older that 3 or 4. this movie was cute but predictable . it was worth the $ 5 .
having seen the broadway musical this is a wonderful reminder of a show and of a time long gone but should n't be forgotten
i bought this as a gift for my husband for christmas . it is very funny , but make sure no children are anywhere around when playing it .
this is a movie that will stand the test of time . the movie is entertaining and the music is good ( by the four tops ) but beware of the ending too much cursing .
this show is so well made from setting costumes acting etc . i would recommend it to anyone . watch it while downton abbey is not showing !
not all that much to say . every one knows the movie . if you like it then buy it here . made the wife happy
my favorite show in the entire world ! so glad all the seasons are finally on prime ! ca n't say enough about how happy i am to have it prime finally !
loved the newest of the star trek movies great special effects and the actors did a great job in portraying the star trek tradition to a new generation .
one of my husbands favorite movies ! every now and then we pull this movie out and find it entertaining . one of the reason i ordered it on blu-ray .
my daughter loves this show and asked for the first two seasons so i got this for her . very clever , funny and quirky show , the kind we love !
have always loved this movie . glad i could find a dvd of it . used one i recorded from the tv for years .
thank you so much . i have always enjoyed hobbit movies . you did super and deserve 5 stars . thanks so much
i really enjoyed watching this movie . i rated high because it was just well done and i would recommend it to all !
great storyline , great talents , keeps me on the edge of my seat ! now i understand why its been going on so long , i definitely would recommend !
even with the movies low budget it scared me and my wife more than most big budget films ever have . some of the special effects are a little cheesy but what do expect from a low budget film .
this movie is funny when you watch it and some of the things they said . for the dad in the movie try to find him a wife .
loved it . sure it 's campy now but in it 's day it scared the crap out of me . loved watching this again all these years later . wish the second season was available ... now .
enjoyable original movies by disney . love black and white versions , but i know most people would prefer colorized version . love these type of films .
just a fun movie to watch . i did n't expect a lot when i purchased the movie but it was a fun watch . do n't take it too seriously . it is full of fun and action .
this movie came in great condition as it was advertised . it was shipped quickly and arrived in a good time frame from when i ordered it . i recommend this movie to anyone i can think of .
just a beautiful story follows a life in a touching and sensitive way that is easy to watch and easy to enjoy
despite the mixed reviews , i think this movie is worth watching at least once . i actually liked the movie and ordered it so i could watch it again . i thought it was a good story .
my wife an i liked this movie . it is very similar to pitch black . has a lot of action and weird monsters ...
awesome movie . i laughed through the whole movie . i hope to see a grown ups 3. this was so entertaining .
this dvd shows cop shows from the 70 's . they 're okay , but none of them are shows i 'd want to see again .
bought for my brother . he enjoyed it . he enjoys the older shows and has a big collection of dvd 's and most are of the older movies .
saw this at the movies and everyone in the family loved it so i had to own it . low cost and fast delivery .
some funny parts ( everything you already have seen in the trailers ) but is too long and not funny enough . hoped for more .
i wanted to know more of the story and got it , , , kind of a surprise ending tho ! was it really over ?
this is a great value for two of the best movies of the `` 90 's . '' this is a great choice to purchase for those who collect some of the decade 's best action thrillers .
i love this movie - i love both robert and reese as well as the other main actor in it ( they all did great ) !
cute movie did not think i would like it but was pleasantly surprised ! it kept my attention for the entire movie !
this movie had a good premise , but it was poorly executed . many of the things that happened did n't make a lot sense
awesome short stories , love the art , and creativity . needed to be a little longer for me . look forward to the next one .
i loved this movie and how judy garland played this character . this is when she 's at her best .
my grandson asked my to purchase this item so that he could add it to his collection of classics . he gave it 5 stars .
still one of my favorite movies . the blu-ray looks better than the old dvd . in this time of cgi everything , the movie still holds up .
have not yet had a chance to watch this season . have enjoyed the others so hoping these will be as enjoyable .
this is the first bond movie that i actually enjoyed . i 've never been a big fan of the bond movies
if you 're a dallas fanatic , you 've already purchased the other seasons so why would n't you add this to your collection .
great movie with great stars . had seen it years and years ago and will definitely watch it a few more times . would recommend to anyone .
it is a good movie and it is also nice to see it come to blu-ray . glad i bought it .
this was pretty good movie considering arnold 's age i enjoyed it would recommend had a a good story line but just pretty good
i did n't know what to expect , but the movie was enjoyable and full of excitement , of what you did n't know will come next .
i love action packed movies and this was one . saw taken so wanted to see taken 2 and was very pleased with this one .
not great but then again , a very different jim carrey role . entertaining but difficult to follow .
my dvd has no dvd case im so sad about that , if i had know that i would n't of bought the dvd . but the dvd is good i suppose
i like this series i got into it and i enjoy watching it and my family enjoy watching is a good series
this is a great classic film for the family to enjoy . good plot with all types of twist in the story .
this two part episode is perhaps the high point of the next generation tv series . the story , acting , premise , and blu-ray updated special effects are thoroughly entertaining .
my husband is collecting all of clint eastwood 's films and t v series so we bought this to do that
wow is all i have to say . i started to watch it on bbc and i knew that i would want it for my collection . it is fabulous . i reccomend highly . i loved it ... ...
movie was cute , had some very comical moments . : ) it 's a feel good movie . enjoy ! i did enjoy it and recommend for fun viewing
good cast but the end of movie was not creative . wish i would knew or read the review carefully . sadly !
another good movie , both my wife and i liked it alot . it 's not to many movies that dwayne does is not good
the dvd a different story arrived on time and in excellent condition . i thoroughly enjoyed viewing the dvd . i highly recommend this dvd to anyone who enjoys viewing a romantic film with a different twist .
raw is what this is . eddie at his best . the early days were some of his best .
great actors , great filming on location , tom hanks and julia roberts are profound actors in this great movie . love movies that are based on a true story .
24 hours a season is a great concept , fast paced , has you on the edge of your seat , one hour goes by in a flash .
it is so much fun the hear that some of your favorite actors can really sing and also dance too . they also keep their great character comedy interaction alive . awesome !
product arrived on time and in great condition . have not yet viewed this dvd yet so i can not make an accurate opinion on the content of this dvd .
this movie was right out horrible . not sure , about all these positive reviews . in addition , the acting was bad just as well . the artwork on the front cover is misleading .
the dvd was in excellent shape . the film is outstanding and thought it very interesting and too bad bruce dern did not win an oscar for his performance .
wonderful movie was glad i could find this movie on dvd . excellent quality dvd it 's made to last for years .
good but not great . seemed to move a little to fast but was entertaining . acting was good but not great .
good action movie with good actors as well . a kind of surprise ending with good visuals along the way as well .
this genre is just great for the clothes , the plots or lack of , the entire package ! the stories are fun and funny and these types of movies are a great gift for the sci-fi fan .
i recommend it to watch with friends or family . saw it with the family and they enjoyed it . add it to library
these movies and books are give and take . i think that it could have been a whole lot more . i was really hoping that you guys would have had a package on our hands with this one
... than acting . no academy awards - but enjoyed the story . was more like a documentary . mildly scary . would watch it again .
i am typically not a fan of romantic comedies , but this one is not so bad . although not a favorite movie , it is one i do not mind watching and will watch again .
but they do n't happen so that we can see something amazing and extraordinary . they happen so that we can see someone amazing and extraordinary . watch this movie and see him !
this is by far the best movie ever made . if you 're reading this you already know that ! ! ! yeah baby ! !
if you like romantic mysteries then hart to hart is for you . great actors , good storylines , a must see for those that love the genre .
i rented this movie because there were no others that looked interesting , but it turned out to be pretty funny for the rental ! worth renting
my son watched the movie over and over ! my husband even watched it a couple of times . you should at least watch it once .
i 've had this movie in vhs for a long time so i decided to buy it in dvd so my daughter can watch it with me .
if you 've ever wondered what goes on in the video game world , here it is ! sweet , inspirational and creative . good movie . yes yes . we will probably buy this one .
i finished season 1 and could n't wait to start on the second season . it 's a lot of fun with great characters and a great storyline .
i had not watched this series before . i really do enjoy watching it on my ipad . kinda scary and cool . of course love amazon prime which provides so much to watch .
think everyone has been in question with themselves between what they really want , and what they think they want in life .
i have never seen the movie so the rating is only for the product 's quality . the disc did not work for any dvd player i put it in !
the book was simple and so was the movie . if you loved the book you 'll like the movie . i thought the book was fair and so was the movie .
see my previous reviews of earlier seasons and then understand that it just keeps getting better with each new season .
pride and prejudice is an all time classic . there have been remakes on this film but the original is wonderful .
love it ! i had seen this movie several years ago , and decided to buy it . it is a good story .
not enough to make me watch it twice , but i laughed a lot during it . i would recommend it to a friend .
really brought the famous opera to life in an easy to understand and follow format ! i would recommend this movie ! ! !
what can i say ? there is nothing to say watch it . if your not watching it then your dumb . god i 'm in the wrong line of work !
this is an awesome collection . my kids ages 5 , 4 , and 2 absolutely love the tall tales . highly recommended to all parents who care about what their kids watch .
a great collection of snl holiday skits , with an outstanding cast of characters ! i enjoyed this purchase immensely ! i will be watching this dvd over and over !
if you have nothing to do , you might mildly enjoy this movie . it is not the worst movie i have ever watched , but it is far from the best that i have seen .
these 2 together are hilarious . melissa mccarthy is perfect as the partner to sandra bullock 's character . hope to see a sequel sometime in the future .
nice christmas story . good movie for the romantic and kids . clean movie with no surprises , predictable but cute . it 's great for christmas family movie time .
a great fantasy , combined with a romantic adventure . this is a sleeper that will keep your interest . interesting characters , well played by a fine cast . highly recommended .

my daughter and i love to watch movies and this was a good addition to our collection . came on time and would recommend it .
i thought this movie was cute as hell ! loved it ! was a little corny , but that 's the way i like 'em ! will watch again and again . reminded me of me and my mom !
its a good series touching stories tells you more about them . i highly recommend to all ages . good for history fans .
this is just great stuff they dont make them like this any more , can not get enough of this type of tv
such a great funny movie ... and not that over the top funny where it starts to get a little awkward .
this movie was well priced and arrived quickly . it was a good addition for my disney movie collection . a very funny movie .
this old movie , is also a well watched movie , so glad we got it on dvd , because our vhs was dead , and its so much better like this love this movie
all of the mummy series i enjoyed . these were the monsters in my younger years . i enjoyed this collection very much .
do n't care for violence and did n't watch this movie with my husband .
classic series from the 90s . rather bad color and art but with such great stories and voice acting , it is still enjoyable to watch today .
this is a very exciting movie with a lot of twists and turns . my wife and i enjoyed the movie very much .
i loved the twist near the end -- made it so dramatic . a great ending to a wonderful series . i highly recommend .
blue-ray really adds to the visual action and enjoyment of the alien series . excellent quality . only negative would be no extras included - just 3 dvd 's in a colorful box .
bought this when vcr were still popular . nice video and audio quality . nice to watch with your friends and family .
the humanity of the two main characters is very heartwarming . the struggle to be free at impossible odds is a triumph of a beautiful spirit .
this was a fun take on a classic show . i watched the original series and loved the movies ' approach . my entire family loved it .
i watched these shows when a kid so i bought them for my kids to see and they loved it .
if you have not seen this flick , this is a great movie for any age . i would recommend this movie to anyone that likes funny movies .
i loved watching this show on television and i recently wanted to watch more of it but it 's now off the air . i decided to buy this and i have n't looked back since !
we found this to be entertaining . we also watched barbie in a mermaid tale ii , and we recommend them both . the animation was good , storyline good .
i think the acting is good . i like seeing a reproduction of how life might have been like back then .
my wife and i very much enjoyed watching this movie . no bad language , no violence . a nice story with a happy ending .
this is a good go to when tv sucks i have watched it many times and its still pretty good , check it out .
what a great movie ! great story and fun movie , very suitable for family movie night . fun for everyone ! loved the characters and the heart behind the story .
my nephew loves this movie . it 's one of his favorites . i do n't even mind watching it over and over again . it was cheap and in great condition which just makes it even better .
this is a darn good , nostalgic flick any little girl or most old ladies would love . i love it and bought this for my granddaughter .
i can watch this with my child or by myself over and over again we even have the cars to the movie
the performances were quite good , the movie was fun to watch . all actors did a good job especially gerard butler , he has good comedic timing .
thank you so much ! was great to finally have one of my favorite movies ! love amazon and so glad i found this movie
this dvd series arrived on time and in perfect condition . this is perfect for our collection . we will definitely buy from this vendor again .
slow start , but the character development , clever plots , and excellent acting made this a favorite by the end of the season
this is an unusual movie . this movie is about this person is a small space craft like machine in a person . this is funny .
this movie was almost impossible to sit through . that is why i have it listed for sale .
i saw this movie when it came out in the 80 's and enjoyed it then . a lighthearted romance with a few laughs , i would recommend it .
excellent video and audio quality . nice story . nice special effects for an animation film . kids would enjoy watching this movie as well as adults .
as i have said before , this series is the best on television . i can hardly wait from one sunday night until the next .
it was only a couple of dollars to buy , so i did ... that is all i really have to say about it ... . lol
this makes the classic story of robin hood come alive ! we all enjoyed it very much ! we highly recommend it !
there are n't a lot of series that i would buy on dvd , but this is one of them . just adding my voice . . .
with all the heavy weight actors in this film , i expected it to be better . it was not a very plausible story .
when i watch these , i am curious as to the real story and characters the author had in mind . good story . not for the faint at heart .
same old stuff here - average special effects with mediocre direction and acting . i watched about half then shut it off .
it was a little dark for me . i had trouble with the subtitles and i really did n't finish it . it is just not my kind of movie .
this movie and the product was absolutely in great timing , quality and everything just was unbelievably good and very affordable !
we did not like this movie at all . it certainly was not a comedy . we would not recommend it at all .
this is my idea of pure light hearted comedy . we have enjoyed every single episode . one of the best ways to end a challenging day with a smile .
my kids love it and i like it very much , we seen it 3 more time in 3 days , that say alot
this is a great show and the storylines are incredible . this is a must-have for any collection big or small .
great movie . saw it years ago but was reminded of it recently . did a lot of research to figure out what movie i was thinking about . loved it : )
great series , love the plots and drama i bought the complete series so i could enjoy it when i wish to stay in or share with my friends
i can not get over how attached i have become to this great actor 's movies . this show what really could happen when our health system fails us .
say what you will about quentin tarantino , the sure knows how to write out some interesting characters and memorable quotes up .
have only watched series 1. the history channel did a very good job of putting together old films of the war . learned a bit in my old age .
not as good as i had expected , but still brought back memories of the family at the theater before we had a tv .
best setting , best writing , best story-line , best acting , best everything ! ! i like this entire series so much - all 3 seasons - that i bought two more sets for my sisters !
this movie is my least favorite of the harry potter movies . it came when i ordered the dvd so its a great deal .
love this movie am going to buy it . as always they rock for action packed movies . a must see ! ! ! !
the series doesnt get funny up until season 5 , so unless you love south park then i wouldnt recommend getting this season
the story begins slowly and it is hard to stay with it until it begins to make sense . in the end it turns out well .
this was just funny from the time it starts to the ending . if you really do n't want to think to hard and just want entertainment this is the movie for you . enjoy
it arrived on time , in good condition i had no problems i would definetly order again , i love the movie its great
great movie . language is old style but something makes it all the greater for it . it is not an action film .
this show has so many stars in it i ca n't even name them all ... one of the funniest movies i have ever seen full of action and crazy antics ... .a must see .
always great laugh on this show . even when they touch on serious adult subject matter , there 's always a laugh to be had .
very intense with a great storyline . worthwhile at a higher price . washington is always good and is in many good films
i always expect something else but it is what it is . i liked it -- loved it no but a enjoyable enough !
it was a very good movie i love it i really recommended to all kind of people i love it
this is not a bad action flick if you have a rainy day and want to see something with a little intensity . but the story and acting could have been a bit better .
the movie has already been out on bluray . enough with a description . someone , please tell me if this edition has a superior picture quality - a better bit rate , more detail , etc .
i have rented this movie from my local library a couple of times as well as seeing it on tv so i decided that it was time to finally own it .
it 's nice to own such a funny series . so far it 's one of our favorites to watch again and again .
i think if i were an american , especially from the mid west , i would have cried a lot . very interesting , well worth watching , or perhaps worth suffering through .
amazing classic that never disappoints . with a dialogue that you want to quote every day . not too dark and just the right amount of humor
portrayed very well , with that and our favorite john wayne , they are great hits . thanks for the good reproduction of these on dvd to replace our vhs 's .
so cheesy but so good ! must-see for anyone who knows what they 're getting and is thrilled by it ! loved it !
i really like this movie . it 's very funny . if you like period movies you 'll love this .
if you like to see actual world war 2 footage , and especially about their youth programs there during that time , then this is a good place to start .
we watched it twice on christmas . a great addition to the series . enjoyable for all ages . nice to see the faces of the voices at the end .
i am happy to have this but i have not had time to view it.i am pleased with it .
was a big fan of this show when i was a teenager . it was good seeing alot of those episodes i remember so well again .
how can you not love this series ? ? ? we have the whole thing on discs and i am sure we will watch it over and over , catching new little twists each time !
i have always liked matlock and hope that they get more seasons to buy online . i will buy them . thanks
this is an old show that was well know in it 's day , and now is not up to date enough to enjoy . we think at my house it is not a film we need .
wow , what a 3-d experience . so realistic you feel the sea monsters are in your living room .
my daughters love this movie ! i would recommend this movie to anyone 's movie collection . this will be a long standing favorite in my house !
this has to be one of the best barbie videos yet ! the color in this was amazingly beautiful , and it was a very good story , i hope there are many more made like this . thanks !
a wonderful classic movie . a movie i love to watch many times . i would definitely buy this movie again .
great service . love the film . hitchcock 's daughter did a wonderful acting job in her father 's film . happy to add this to my hitchcock collection .
this is a very good movie with denzel washington and mark wahlberg . this was very entertaining and fun to watch .
simply put , i liked the movie . it held my interest . i saw the movie twice , so far . a movie is n't good if i ca n't watch it more than once .
just as great and funny with lots of laughter as all the other seasons before it . i really did enjoy it as much as the first 3 seasons .
gritty story . a bit predictable but a must watch for kurt russell fans . strong language used at times in this movie .
i liked this movie . it told you how strong a woman can be if she has to . and she could be what was in her heart !
great movie , definite must see . great cast and storyline . perfect movie for any tom hardy fan . he 's great in this film !
one of the best ever musical productions ! there has never been a time it did n't lift my spirits and make me smile !
i 've never seen the original but thoroughly enjoyed this remake . it had good acting , story and a good sense of humor . it was pretty freaky . i highly recommend it to horror fans .
this was a great way to preview this series , and what it has to offer . i will buy more of these in the future .
i love this show so this dvd set just ranks right up there with greatness .
excellent , well written mysteries about a young detective who has a great deal of integrity and really wants to know the truth . a lot of excellent british actors .
if you have not seen it , stop reading and start watching . yes , it is that good . we 'll written and it never gets old .
it was a good price . i thought it was the new movie but i was wrong . but that is okay . still worth the price i paid
it was humorous and has great actors who portray the characters well , but it was much more sexual than i expected and appreciate .
learned so much about elvis i did n't know , especially his family history . loved it ! a must for elvis fans wanting to know how elvis and events in his life created his character .
love it great disney christmas movie bring tear to my eyes every time i watch great movie to watch all year round
now that the end time has passed i wonder what the value of this is . enjoyable for entertainment though at a good price .
both of my sons enjoy this series . they use to use all of the space on our dvr to record them but now that they have all seasons they are happy and so are we !
if you enjoy these charlie chan films you should consider buying the whole collection as i did . it will bring back so many good feelings of the past .
a must have for any dr. who fan . it was great to see the original footage . wish there was more
love the series , just wish it had more episodes . i would watch it forever if they made it . please make more
ok movie . the graphics are great . sandra is always great . no real story to this except what you see . i am glad i did n't buy it .

just as with the first series , i never tire of these episodes , watching them repeatedly . i just wish there were more than four seasons .
awesome story line - love bradley cooper in this . oh if there really were such a thing and it did n't have side effects
nothing deep here , just gadgets and explosions , good guys vs bad guys , revenge and lost loves . just sit back and enjoy
i love this movie so does my hubby . it is based on true events . it 's a must see movie . you will like it .
this is another super addition to my library . i love these old movies and i will continue to watch them again and again .

since this movie is base in a true life story , is a very talented and performed true events in new york city , love this movie .
blue-ray is the new thing , and sleeping beauty looks perfect , and crisp , and clear . sound is the best , picture is gorgeous and the films is still the best .
this is an awesome movie . the only reason i gave it three stars instead of five is because i 'd like to see it released has a two disc , unrated , special edition set ! ! !
just another set of old westerns . that my dad wanted to watch old men like westerns it played ok ok
great british mystery . my husband is in love with anything british and really enjoyed this .

not the greatest movie but definitely entertaining . it has a good story . good to see at least one time . : )
really enjoy the show . i used to watch them years ago and and they are just as great now . the characters work very well together and the show writers know their comedy .
not bad a nice video and i really did enjoy it i like to watch it over and over again
do n't have any idea why they made the movie and the acting could have been much much better if more money had been spent on the making of the movie
a most colorful , entertaining as well as well acted movie . the music was delightful ! good choice of actresses for the three girl 's . a must have for musical lovers . mouse up
this one is not as good as the first but it is still sick and twisted . check it out if u liked the first 1
watch the first one and then this one . laugh out loud and cheer for the family . cute movie to rewatch
love this movie so cute and entertainment great disney movie for any age it also has great character and great songs

as a stephen king fan , i loved this when it was first shown on tv , and i loved it when i watched it again on dvd .
good show hope they keep making them . i like how they go back and forth between countries and how they all play together
four more great world war two movies on one dvd . even though i have seen them on the tv i still ordered the dvd to have on hand if i wanted to see them again .
good movie , say the id story on this . ca n't believe this is an actual story , more so thinking he was going to get away with those events .

i always liked this movie ... and with the other two , it makes a good set . good story and plot , wish there were more .
it was a great movie when i was a kid and i still think it is a great movie today .
with a world where technology is part of culture , it show 's how family is still a bond stronger than technology . this has to be a must have for any fan of anime .
a good watch , believable with enough twists and turns to keep it interesting . well acted and is one i watch every couple years .
i like watching the old match and see who the fans picked . this one is for any one who like these type of matches .
i used to watch this show as a child when it aired on tv . very funny and original . love the movie also .
they do n't make movies like this anymore , suspenseful , powerful characters , meaningful story line and a delightful look into the pass .
so bad we turned it off after a short time , could n't even find anything to laugh at , which we understood was the appeal of the movie .
uplifting , great story line and excellent acting . decent sound track too . a terrific movie for kids as well as adults .
this video was pure fun . i would recommend it to all of my friends . just might watch it several more times .
dead like me : the complete collection ... .. if you do not like this you have not watched it this is a deal i would never pass up get you will not be sorry

it 's a great movie for the whole family . they do n't make them like this anymore . most of the start are gone .

this is a charming , feel-good western well-acted by john wayne and katherine hepburn . good dialogue and plot . i highly recommend it ! !
i love these movies . my grandchildren are now also fans . prior to watching these recently they had no idea who he was .
my wife and i found this to be a bit boring and not as good as the first one . and many of the situations were quite unbelievable .
this is a wonderful show about how strange creatures can become friends and help each other . fun family that will make you laugh and maybe cry .
breaking bad is one of the greatest series of all times . the fifth season is great and it helps build to the thrilling next season . you will not be disappointed in this season .
movie was great sad how the girl was treated but the movie was insane hope theres # 3 would so look forward to it
a mini series was the best way to handle this book . an entertaining version that stays true to the spirit of the original story . director 's cut is better than the television version .
i liked watching this series to find out how its going to end ! very exciting events happened and you can never guess what 's the next move to either the police or the gang ! very nice
this was a very good but complicated film . you need to see this one twice .
also have the book . very good movie , although a little different from the book in a few areas i thought were significant .
a good comedy with a heart , even if from very & # 34 ; rough & # 34 ; old guys . not good for an audience under 16 .
this was not a new movie but i had not seen it previously . there are some pretty good scenes and some that could have been better . the overall product was a good movie worth watching .
this traditional old disney movie so touching and loving and sad all rolled up into one . family all love it .
i really loved this show . wondering if there will be a part three . donald sutherland was brilliant as always . loved it .
love this series . one of my favorite ! very addictive though . i watch one , and then i have to watch the next one . love it , and so will you !
it 's a movie that i thought i knew right at the beginning what was going on but a nice surprise it took a nice turn .
this is a very good movie , this is one movie that will keep you guessing on who the killer is . it is action packed and an all out good thriller .
i liked this movie because it had jeff bridges in it felt like we were watching men in black so it was great .
you will see mostly hardy boys but nancy drew helps them a lot . holds you in suspense . better then newer shows for kids and adults .
great story and well filmed . good to watch on a rainy day . the four stars are for the & # 34 ; fun factor & # 34 ; .
i really enjoyed watching this film . it is good entertainment and jake did a great job as usual .
this movie was very moving as was the novel . i very much enjoyed both of them . i love the actresses that were in it .
bought this for my son he is trying to get all seasons . came in a timely fashion and at a good price .
you just got ta love tina ! watching her on stage or listening to her cd 's will make you smile , buy this dvd ! ! ! ! !
i have always loved this series . i am so glad that it is now for sale . i have all but two seasons . i will purchase them as soon as i can .
received dvd in great shape and was well packaged , this is one of my favorite actors , and i have a lot of his movies .
good animation ; good story ; good interaction between the bear and wahlberg . i liked it for creativity , but it could have been written stronger , for more funny .
even though i do not have young children , i decided to rent this movie . i loved it . a good lesson to learn ... love and respect your mother !
gift for the wife ! her favorite star , richard gere is in it . she said it had a great story line . wwii
again hugh jackman gives us another view of the wolverine . as to be expected , fast paced and plenty of action . if you liked the x-men series and the previous wolverine movie you wo n't be disappointed .
i loved this movie . if i could trade places with jane for a short time i would do it in a minute ! what a great idea this movie is . a must see for any austin fan .
got it in the mail , case slightly damaged , but it looks like normal wear and tear . very happy with it , thanks so very much
good twist on the old movie , but i did not like the new khan . but i did like the new story and the rest of the movie .
was looking forward to watching this move and i am glad i got it . the family really like the movie a lot of fun to enjoy .
this is a ready made scream fest ... got ta have it , got ta have it all !
as remakes go this was terrible , the orginal is far better , the remake is so-so , the back ground music is better and that about the only good thing about the remake ,
i have read the story many times but seeing this film really made it come alive . the film made a huge impression on me and i thought the whole thing was very well done .
strange little movie , but i enjoyed it . if you have prime it is worth seeing it for free , but i would n't spend the money at red box for it .
i have n't seen this movie before , bought it without knowing exactly what it was about , and i 'm glad i did ... disc is in perfect condition as promised and it was such a good movie
this was a favorite of my own children . we watched it together and had the best time remembering better days . i could n't believe how much the main actors had n't change !
book was fabulous and i had high expectations for the movie . perhaps if i had n't read the book i would have given this movie 5 stars instead of only 4 .
seeing these 3 together again and hearing their songs , which sound as good as ever , is a gift . now that mary is gone , especially , fans will appreciate the performance .
so happy i could purchase this set ~ amazingly funny shows & lots of good memories watching them as a kid !
great writers and great actors ! this show is so perfectly put together . just ca n't have enough of it . freaking fantastic ! ! !
great film one of the classic westerns would reccommend for any one 's library of western films or horses and cowboys
i collect dvds of shows that i enjoy watching . although i received this later than season 7 , it was in good condition .
great series . i have all of them from the beginning and enjoy them all . i will keep ordering them if anymore come out
what a devil of a man . this movie says it all and the actors do very well to keep the audience engaged .
this movie could have been better . it was okay and i did get to see some action in this movie .
if you are looking for a good movie with a good message , this is the movie for you . it has a good , subtle christian message . our family really enjoyed this movie .
i enjoyed watching this christmas , this movie has the perfect cast and a funny story line . this christmas reminded me of my family on the holidays . a good movie to watch anytime of the year ! !
can it really be christmas without watching this wonderful movie . we have a family tradition . we watch it every year .
great so fun ! loved it ! really enjoyed it ! fresh and fun ! still great even after al these years ! loved it !
needless to say , i love it . im currently on season 4 and know that i will be disappointed when it all comes to an end .
my wife is a huge fan of this series and somehow this season went missing . so ordered replacement only to find a week later . that aside very good show highly recommend .
i decided it was time to purchase this film . we watch it every time it comes on so now we can see it any time we choose .
without giving up too much , just in case you want to see it . the movie was ok , most of what was going on took me by surprise
the book series were even better , but the movies were great , too . i do believe we own the entire story now , and we never tire of watching this movie in any order .
this is a very enjoyable movie . the acting is excellent . the only problem i have is that the movie drags a little at times , but when the action picks up you are glued to the screen .
i wanted more after viewing the entire series . it is such a good story and i enjoyed every minute of it . highly recommend
it had a great twist that i wasnt expecting . had to keep watching it due to the story , pretty good !
got this for my husband for christmas . he loves this show and was very excited to get season 1 and 2 for christmas .
you ca n't go wrong with scooby doo - it is fun for all the family . i watched with the kids and felt like a kid again .
liked the series , but just 2 seasons , it get you and thats it , i have both seasons , just disappointed it ended . eve
loved every minute of it . british comedy is so funny and serious at the same time . still watching some of them .
i wish they actually kept this thing running ! today 's cartoons are mildly entertaining in comparison !
this is a must see . comedy , drama , action , suspense , educational , you really ca n't ask for more in a series that touches on the reality of family life .
it is one of the best movies i had seen back in the day , everyone needs to see this movie
both actors at their & # 34 ; subtle & # 34 ; best . extraordinary chemistry among the actors . you know some of these people . 1 , 2 , 3 .
even after all of these years , this film is still wonderful . a must for all who miss him still . brings back many memories of watching it the first time !
another great old classic had to add it to my collection . winner of 3 academy awards including best picture . include some of the great actors and actress and i am good to go . loved the movie .
sleeping beauty is probably my favorite disney princess , and i absolutely love the music in this film . it 's another must-have disney movie !
this is so much better than the remakes . only fault would be wish they had stayed more with the book .
i am a huge fan of action anime and naruto has plenty of action and a good story . there are funny characters and good morals : ) a great anime for teens to adults : )
it is great series and have more to watch of the series . will watch more at a later time . like it
this is a fun movie to watch . not all that realistic but fun . yes , i would recommend this movie to someone who just wants to be entertained .
i am a 007 fan . this one was ok by my standards so i give it 5 stars .
it was just ok. i had to force myself to watch the whole movie at one time . i 'm sure some people really enjoyed it .
i gave the film two stars because it provided some entertainment . there was some humor in the story , but i did not care for the storyline
my grandchildren loved it and so did i ! i would recommend it for everyone in the family but maybe a little scary to very young children .
sequels have been known to become rather stupid . but this & # 34 ; iron man 3 & # 34 ; delivered well . pretty action packed with humor and a twist .
i liked the movie . it was slow in parts but not too bad . not sure i would buy it or watch it again , but i did like it .
the first was kinda funny in spots , but painful to watch the rest of the season . i kept thinking it would get funny , it did n't . do n't waste your time on this season .
this movie is incredible , anyone that is a fan of westerns should see this movie as well as the first one because they are awesome !
action packed and full of suspense ! excellent cast ensemble . i have already recommended this movie to quite a few friends .
we have watched this one several times now ... .very very good and did not expect the ending which ended up good anyway ... .
the cutting edge first going for the gold movie dvd is my favor i love sweet is my favor sweet i love sweet .
love it and kids do too . they do n't make them like that anymore ! great find and also a great price !
it 's an okay movie . would recommend it to a friend . also , watched on amazon instant video great product and service .
i love monster movies . the story is a good one . the actors and monsters will keep you watching . i even got some of my friends to watch it . they also enjoyed it .
the pace of the movie is quite slow but it 's nice . light up , sit back , and enjoy .
the quality was great and it was nice to get to see this movie in it 's true form once again .
i would recommend this drama series - it 's interesting and the characters are believable . it 's set at the beginning of world war 2 .
it was ok. nothing i would watch with the family . the picture and sound from the stream were very good . just not that great of a movie
excellent series , even better without the long commercials ! a must have for any present or future monk fan .
great cast and non-stop action . glad i rented it . this movie makes it 's sequel , & # 34 ; red 2 & # 34 ; an absolute must see .
i was very surprised after watching this show . it was very excellent and also had very good acting . hated to see it end .
our grandchildren loved this dvd . they watch it even during the summer months . probably because santa is fun every day of the year
love jason statham , he is handsome and a great actor this movie is different from his others but its still has action in it with his amazing fighting scenes .
saw the movie , but needed to have the dvd . it arrived the same day as the release and when i watched it , i realized i had forgotten much of it .
this movie was not quite what i expected . not worth the money as far as i am concerned . others may think differently .
wow ... love old movies ... this was deep , intense , and she had the last laugh in the end ! wow again ! highly recommended if you like old mysteries !
this is a wonderful video , with good lessons and no evil characters . really wonderful . i also enjoy watching it ! my 8 and 9 yr old girls love it .
i give this movie 5 stars for the cinematography alone . i found the plot engaging and the acting excellent . you really feel like you are watching real life .
loved it . my granddaughter and i have watched it at least three times . it 's such a tender story between sisters .
grand kids love this and surprisingly so does my husband . ( me too ) . we watch is frequently when they come . a good addition to our cd library .
i 'll just be frank about it . it was n't very good . i like movies that really pull you into the story and i just felt bored with this one .
the dog is fantastic ! the actors , ok. the story line , ok. good movie for the kids seeing good versus evil , with good winning in the end .
surprisingly good . very funny throughout . well paced , it never feels like you 're waiting for something to happen . very well acted and cast .
the 3d image was sharp , and the sound was awesome . this was a good but at a good price along with a good dvd . who could ask for anything more .
it was a good movie and i enjoyed it . having hugh j and kate b in a movie makes it better .
as usual meryl streep and liam neeson are really great in this movie . the plot is simple but interesting enough for the viewer to want to get involved in the story .
another great movie at the time i 've enjoyed . along with the original black and white feature , i 've truly enjoyed seeing it in color , i 'm happy to have the best of both worlds .
what can i say . it is by far the best movie . we watch it when we can . good to add to the shelf
this was one of audrey hepburn 's best movies . we watched it again and were just as happy . thanks to the vendor for their great service .
it does enough to keep you interested and you wo n't be looking at your watch . the plot is simple , you get an idea of what will be happening next but it 's not overly predictable .
this series is extremely educational and lots of fun . we 've been watching it since my son was about 4 ( he 's six now ) and we still watch it .
thought this was going to be a good wholesome movie . if you have values than you might not want to get this . was very disappointed in it .
there was too much hype about this movie . the special effects and 3d were great . the story just sucked it was very dull and slow paced .
these jesse stone movies are excellent ... tom selleck is perfect for the lead ! ! ! ! the story line makes you think , music is good ! !
this is such a great and amazing show i wish i would have gotten it sooner . i would recommend it to anyone who would like an anime with a story .
our youngest daughter loves scooby doo , just as i did when i was her age . it was a wonderful feeling to sit and watch these mysteries with her .
i cant believe i didnt watch this on tv when it aired but oh well i can watch 2 or 3 episodes at a time now ! love the drama and suspense
i liked the movie . mark and the rock are funny ! ! ! ! the fact that it is a true story kinda make you think how accurate the movie is
my grand children love it . a lot of action to keep their attention . it was sent in great condition to us .
very good deal . seen the show on cartoon network and really liked it . the whole season in one package . a great steal for the price .
there is so much to be said about this film , but i do n't want to spoil it . it went inside the regret a parent must feel when their child does something against society .
i love this movie so much . it is so good and keeps you interested constantly . i recommend it to everyone !
my little boy loves this movie and i think it was a great sequal to the first ! it made the decision to purchase the blu-ray version so much easier !
kept my interest through the whole movie , pretty sad movie but makes you think about things that can happen . i have recommended this movie to friends and family .
dvd 's are standard dvd 's and packaging is typical for a box set . i can say i really hate the commercials for their other dvd 's at the beginning of this one and all the others ...
ordered it based on a recommendation . it was a good movie even though somewhat brutal when it came to working with people
okay movie , a little hokey and slow at times but entertaining enough . not at all realistic but what movie is these days ?
very intense believe able movie about jesus christ . even though it is subtitled , it 's easy to understand what 's going on . another must see ! !
did n't seem to stick as closely to the book as the others , but then a good amount of time has passed since i read the book
great series , unfortunate that it only ran for a season or two . would of liked to have seen more , and at the price on sale it was a great steal in my opinion .
my family loves this movie . it is very funny and the characters are a joy . we 've watched it a couple of times already .
if you are a johnny deep fan this is a great pirate movie for your collection . it was sent to me on time and packed well very pleased
i love this movie , it 's different and not like all the others . the whole thing is just fun . the actors , the story , all of it is amazing !
this is a great old movie that we watch over and over . has a lot of twists in the plot and enjoyable through the years .
i bought this for my 10 year old son after he would see it playing at the comic book store . he loves it !
many thanks for your prompt service , it was good to see this video once more , good to know i have this for later !
loved this movie . took awhile to find it but was well worth the search . i dont think my kids enjoyed i as much as i did . lol
i 'm a huge john candy fan , this movie is one of my favorites of his . i guess you ca n't go wrong with both pryor and candy .
my mother loves this movie ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
i finally got the last one to add to my collection i have the whole set of the three stooges , vol . 1 to 8
i got this one for my father and he love it . i enjoy see it too . any one who is a daniel craig fan will like this one .
this movie was a joke . it was about these different people who all had problems and it just did n't do it for me
ca n't say enough about the roseanne seasons of shows . just a great bunch of shows to really make you think and give you a laugh as well .
i am such a fan of the old musicals . music , costumes and the acting , what a great way to spend time .
good story line , and kept my attention right up until the end . this one was n't as boring as i thought it might be .
this was a good program when it was on , i tried to watch when i could , it has great acting , lot of action if you like this type of show .
good movie , great action scenes . jason statham keeps making good movies . good storyline , better acting and action . suprised me with how good it was compared to my low expectations .
i especially liked the acting in this movie . sutherland was good . the ending left you hanging and wanting more . but other than that , good entertainment .
i love this series ! it is well written and the actors are great ! keeps you interested from start to finish .
my family really enjoyed this movie over the thanksgiving holidays . it is not for small children . all the adults were laughing so much after the kids went to sleep .
this is a great movie , one i can enjoy more now that surround sound and large tv 's are around . an oldie but a goodie : )
we enjoyed the film very much . visually very good with good acting . the animation was smooth , and the graphics were excellent .
glad that this movie was true to real life . also was pretty funny so i 'd definitely watch it again ! highly recommended !
this is one of my grandchildren 's favorite movies . well made and graphics are realistic . i would recommend this to others .
maybe they are old and some say outdated , but my grandchildren are totally enthralled with these movies . way to go , the peanuts gang still lives !
same jokes same actors same hilarious product . if you have enjoyed seasons one through nine then season ten will not disappoint .
nice family movie . gentle , emotional and touching . when you feel like a nice quiet evening and there is nothing on amazon prime provides this .
i cant say more , but this movie is really worth it . arnold is really cool
acting good , story ok but it is based on true story . people can not find this in netflix .
it worked great no problems . it is a great dvd . . . . . . . . .
come on its the classic batman flicks that was bad a $ $ and did n't need much work as the movies we have now too much computer graphics . excellent buy for movie collectors !
matlock has been in reruns forever but you ca n't beat a good show . never get tired of watching this show .
i purchased this to complete my set and was thrilled with its quality and faithful rendition of the story . a very good purchase .
really great story for young and old . i 've bought several copies to share with others !
a tear jerker for sure . enjoyed the movie and have shared it with others and they have positive comments on it
the series is great i have ordered thru you the entire set . i also have the first sex ad the city . this is great
this stuff never gets old ! great writing and it sure is nice seeing all the old familiar faces ! yes , it 's dated , but fun !
great fiction movie that nonetheless guess you thinking about the impact the human race has on nature . a must watch .
i have always loved this movie and watch it at least once a year . i wanted a blu-ray copy and boy does it deliver ! great service too !
i have not watched it yet , but i love all these midsomer murders programs . i have about 14 sets so far and will most likely continue buying them until there are no more to buy .
not quite as good as the first one but still a good movie . i really ca n't think of a film he has made that i did not enjoy .
i bought this movie as a gift . i had looked in several other places for it with no luck , got ta love amazon !
a classic teen comedy ! a very well written film with a great cast . if you have n't seen this one yet , it 's long over due !
service was all it should be but the video was not great . it does not keep my son attention while i am driving which most videos do .
i really enjoy this tv series , one of few that actually gets me to laugh at times . in fact this is my second go at watching the complete series .
it was not an award winner , but well acted , directed and written . i recommend it . the dog fights are fun to watch and the plot is a good one too .
this was a good & # 34 ; movie night & # 34 ; pick . it held my attention throughout with lots of drama and suspense . i would recommend it to my friends .
great movie ! i picked this up just based on the positive reviews and i was not disappointed . anyone who picks this up is in for a treat .
pretty close to the bible account . i bought it to interest others in the bible and a movie is easier to get them to watch than a documentary .
loved the ending - although i think i 'm still confused by it lol . . . .. . . .
the dvd box set was a gift i gave to some one they seem to enjoy it so i guess it was good
loved the dvd and the price was right for me appreciate that very much ! ! . keep up the good work . amazon is a great place to shop .
slow moving , boring , the screen always seemed dark , i kept thinking they would eventually turn up the light . i love period movies , but this was a disappointment .
this is a great series -- wonderful actors ! ! ! ! my husband and i really enjoyed watching season one . you are left guessing what will happen next . not predictable really and i like that .
good comic book on screen , but i suppose i just could not keep my interest in this film . i am sure younger viewers may like this more .
the writing and acting are excellent as is the storyline . we will continue to watch this show . missed it the first season and are enjoying now
enjoyed both movies . good to sit and watch a movie without sex , violence and foul language .
watched this movie last weekend with family and everyone loved it , both adults and children . highly recommend for any family movie night .
for some reason it stopped playing half way thru movie then i tried to play and it showed i need to buy it again . i think there is something wrong with this instant movie
this was an amazing and some what ground breaking show . please bring this series to either dvd or even better - streaming ! there is money to be made so there has to be a way !
good movie just to kick back and enjoy for what it is . just a fun picture and well done .
i brought this movie to replace my vhs and i was looking for this in dvd . i found it here and the prices was right . it arrive on time . i like those kind of action movie .
great movie ! my daughter loves it and so do i. its well worth the price and a great movie to start a dora collection of movies .
this movie was very unique in the clint eastwood way . he had good supporting actresses & actors which played their parts well .
great movie . creative plot . laughs for adults and kids . i was thoroughly entertained throughout ! forgot what it was like to see a fun movie .
not as good as book , but , what movie is actually as good as the book , the ending needed to be done with a bit more understanding of the books ending .
purchase was great . robert downey , jr. is great in this movie . i plan to buy the next movie too . love the movie .
jennifer lawrence is fabulous ! was n't sure i 'd like the story , but it was very well done & i did enjoy it .
i bought this just for the bonus material . i love it . i think that every dvd should include a lot of bonus material . sometimes it 's the best part of the movie .
this movie is great ! exciting and thrilling . i love matthew mcconaughey 's performance . i would definitely suggest others watch this movie !
great to see it again after all these years and the dvd extras were just wonderful . five stars to a well deserved release . thanks .
this movie is part of a series . great movie and is a good family movie . i highly recommend the entire series to all age groups .
you just got to have it - being a collector - they are enjoyable for my opinion that is -
i had an old copy of this movie from cable . it is nice to get a good original at fair price not outrageous .
saw this movie on tv first and knew immediately that we needed a copy . a super movie for all to see .
this sequel was done just as well as the first . it was also entertaining for the children as well as the adults .
i all way 's like family guy , it is a funny show , its my best show that i like it is funny .
definately not for kids ! we watched the season in 1 week and enjoyed the story . ordered season 4 ( on the waiting list ) .
this has been a favorite for a lot of years . i enjoy this version over the newer one with tom cruise although it is okay as well . thanks
we love this movie . the good guys win and the villain loses in the end and is really a good joe in the end . i think this is one of doris day 's better movies .
the film was very interesting . and it just goes to show that one person can make a difference for good .
it was well edited , exciting scenes , good actors and just really good sci-fi fun . i will watch it again and again
you can tell its a lower budget , but it is still pretty good . i did n't feel like it was one of those home movie types of horror films . it definitely has some strong points .
the show has a natural feel to it . in other words ; they seem or at least try to keep it real . i would recommend viewing for anyone .
as with all of the mission impossible movies i found this to be exciting and full of action . all of the actors/actresses did a fantastic job as always .
i really like the entire sixth season quality production and good action pack by all means , so i really like it and my wife really like the series ; for i bought it for her .
oh my god i loved this movie i laughed and i cry you have to watch this movie it is about life giving and taking those ladies had so much power
i liked party of five since it first aired on television . it reminds us that all families have issues but it is also this same family that is always there for you in the end .
i just watched the first episode and now i am hooked . it 's so interesting how the story plot goes . i look forward to every episode .
this is a love story , and the bonus is keanu reeves , i love this movie , it is such a feel food movie . fast shipping , great price ... ... worth every penny .
at long last a movie that lives up to it 's name . i watched it back to back two times ... stop reading and go watch this fun movie .
i love this dvd it is so funny and all of my family loved it as well , and the price was good as well
i loved this show when it was on air , and i am enjoying it just as much now . in this age of reality tv it 's nice to watch something creative , and witty .
i enjoyed the characters . it is sensitive and funny at the same time . themes did begin to get a bit predictable and repetitive .
the premise was interesting , but i thought there were some major holes in the plot . i like this type of genre , but this particular movie was a bit disappointing .
i was n't pleased with the couple selection . chemistry lacked and they did n't compliment one another . younger actress holds her own but the older one had the wrong part .
lots of twists to the point that you do n't know what is real and what is a dream . kept me interested .
i bought this video series for my wife and she absolutely loves it . this series was one of the best english comedy series for the bbc .
very sad and depressing as the characters lack hope and morality . could only finish half the movie . not a good use of your time .
this is always a go to if we ca n't find anything to watch on tv . old movie but a good one .
product arrived in new condition . i love the sg-1 series and this was a great way to complete my collection .
pretty long , glad i rented and watched the movie at home . thought the movie would be better but it was just ok .
great story , the harry potter series movies have been more faithful to the books than any movie remake i have seen .
it a mind game movie , you have to pay attention to the movies to understand it . it 's a good movie to have .
this was such a great movie . it is a similar story to october baby . it will touch your hear . a great family movie !
arrived on time and in perfect shape . i never thought i would like this one but it turns out that this movie is hilarious .
a classic . . . wonderful . . . wonderful . . . wonderful . . . i highly recommend it .
one of the worst movies i have ever seen , makes the blair witch project look good !
would have been good i think bruce willis is an excellent actor i think i have seen this movie only from tv . thank you
grew up on this movie looked for it everywhere on dvd , found this one and actually gave it as a gift , still need my own copy !
this was a fun movie and lots of action it was a good second movie to the first . hope you enjoy it
great movie . strong , dramatic . different insight on addiction . never boring . must watch if you like personal stories . denzel did an amazing job .
my wife loves this movie so decided to purchase it on blu-ray and it wasnt that bad of a price for this movie . ca n't wait to see it again but in blu-ray instead .
i looked forward to this movie and was terribly disapointed . the movie was 1 hour too long , the special effects were weak , and over the top . wait for it to come out on cable
i loved this low key romance . kristen scott thomas is an actress that i do n't love ( even though she is really good ) ... but in this movie she was so funny !
this 3d movie is awesome and is going to make a great gift for the movie buff in our family .
my 7 year old grandson just love to watch anime and he is starting to collect , this is his first and he watches it constantly
the mini series itself is amazing and very well done . the product in general came in perfect condition with a good case and everything in it . would definitely recommend this product .
this is one of those flicks that comes on tv now and then . i always seem to make time for it . good acting and a good story line .
it 's a classic . hard not to love it . had to get it so that my nephew could watch it at my house when he comes over . ; )
this blu-ray dvd has a very clean picture and sound . also this movie is funny and well written . would recommend ! ! !
this is a crazy movie and it is not for kids . it well have you on the edge of your seats after the movie is finish .
long movie , but well acted and engaging . good story . the ending is not what i expected having never read the comic book series .
this is a great movie , it 's how we wish we could act around people , without a care in the world .
heard this movie got horrible reviews so i thought i would check it out . it was funny and a good movie
this is one of my all time favorite movies ! i am so glad that i found it on amazon for such a reasonable cost .
it was ok , i was hoping it would have been better though . it was worth the money for an evening 's entertainment , but not something we 'll watch over and over .
the movie is like this review . nothing there . after watching it , i was mad at myself for wasting the time to watch it . do n't waste your time .
i think the dog soldiers made for an intelligent werewolf movie . there were creepy parts , with lots of suspense , and likable characters . if you like werewolf movies , you will love this one .
i saw this in the theatres and bought it when it came out on dvd and had to rent it so i could show some people at work . they all loved it of course .
another classic stallone movie to which i highly recommend that you people should go out and buy for your kids
this is a fabulous family movie . it has comedy , romance , but the most important fact is that is great for the family during the christmas holiday season .
so very well done . we enjoyed watching this collection . i know we will probably watch it again . we enjoyed it so much we bought a set as a gift for someone we love .
one of my favorite stories of an old house as a kid , now watching it as an adult a little different because of the filming , but acting still fine .
this is a wonderful dvd on addiction . i am showing it at a family support group . it is a great tool .
will have to watch again to see if i can figure it all out . very long and i think i fell asleep . must have to watch it earlier in the day
x-men was a good movie . perfect summer action flick for teenagers to see with their friends . ca n't wait for the next movies .
i remember watching this program when it was on television , and it 's just as funny today as it was then . very funny and worth watching if you enjoy some silliness .
arrived as promised and was in great shape really happy with the dvd and it is a great movie a really great choice for our collection and a great price .
the trailers made us think it was a comedy and it was not . the acting was good but the story was depressing .
a fun funny movie for kids . my little brother enjoyed laughing through this movie and loves to watch it . 4 stars
kept me interested and glued to the set . great cast and plenty of action . would recommend for an entertaining evening
again , when my wife is happy , i am happy ... i get my wife all the marvel movies when they come out . she is a serious marvel fan .
these are three wonderful mysteries ... i am just sorry that the entire mystery woman series is not available on dvd ... hopefully soon ?
it depicts the time period perfectly for what women were going through . it is not a family film , more for adults .
this is a movie that my wife grew up with and i was able to purchase it and surprise her . it is one of her favorites and i have to be honest i find it heart warming and funny
another fast paced , but i think , the least interesting , of the bourne trilogy . still , it is another very good movie , if you like action and intrigue .
nice to see a series that does n't have blood and gore ! well sometimes blood and doc martin does n't like blood either !
happy to find this one . it is one of my wife 's favorite movies . happy to add it to our collection .
it 's a good movie for kids . my six year old grand daughter loved it . she was laughing through the whole thing .
this is a good insight into the bourne creation . i expect to see more of these . jeremy renner is great .
i was surprised , clint eastwood work is generally good . not this time . x x x x x x x x
it came quickly and was in great condition . i ca n't remember if it was used or not but if it was it looked and worked like new .
good concept but i was disappointed with the lack of chemistry with the leading characters .
so glad i found this , made my christmas ! i never see this on tv and my kids even remembered watching it too . made us all very happy !
usually scooby is a house favorite but this movie would not keep my children engaged at all . i feel that we are avid scooby fans but this is no where close to the movies .
this is a fun ride . it has characters that pull you in . this movie can make you crack up , cry and want to sing the next minute . my family loved frozen and so did i !
this is a good movie that keeps your interest and is n't predictable . my boyfriend and i really enjoyed it . lots of action , chase scenes and suspense .
this is a great family movies love it and my kids love it to got it for a great price came fast love amazon
i love disney animated movies . this is one of the best . i really like the music . i would recommend this movie to anyone .
good story and the actors do a great job -- a must see . lots of adventure ! some violence , but no bad language , which is a plus , these days .
this is an important chapter in american history and i think everyone except small children should watch it . to top it all off the movie was very well acted .
grown ups 2 was even better than grown ups and it 's a dvd you will watch many times over . get ready to laugh !
wow love this movie from disney , and all the stars who are the voices of the dinosaurs , i loved it , wow ! ! !
just loved this film , after watching it 3 times i purchased a copy , its funny , well made , good actors , and a good storyline . well worth a second viewing .
i enjoyed the old shows and the movie . this one is a great one to get if you are a fan of the show .
great buy for a great price , discs are in great condition and i am huge fan of the show so that is all a plus ! ! !
this movie does not require much description or explanation , if you are a movie collector , then this is a must .
great great movie . watch it every time it is on the television cable channel and took it with me on vacation .
i love the view ( and the story ) of the island . it 's played by 2 top actors .
with keaton at his best this is a movie that you will want to watch over and over ! great cast starring in it ! !
of course , alice in wonderland is crazy and colorful and full of adventure . the scenes are cute and young children enjoy this classic .
i 've started watching this movie twice now , and it is so slow , that i am having trouble getting into it . i hope this week that i can get thru the whole thing .
the sets and period clothes are still top notch . the plot is beginning to feel a bit repetitive . still good tv , though .
i loved this series when i was a kid . when i saw it online i just had to buy it .
my friend requested this for her birthday . it 's one of her all-time favorites . she said the acting is great and the story is great .
funny , enough said . this movie is even better than the first ! and they really should 've stopped here . the condition of the case was good and there were no skips in the movie .
this dvd should be watched by everyone who is married or who might want to be married someday .
an above average b horror sci-fi movie . a great movie for older teens on a rainy saturday . lots of action and a bit of unnecessary violence .
typical of sequels , but fun to see after all these years of not knowing there even was a sequel . has it really been that long ? ? ?
this is one of my all time favorites ! i dont have alot of movies on blu-ray but this one makes any collection seem complete !
i have never seen any movie that is steven king that i really did not like . i did not watch this yet but the condition is great .
i watched in television all this program and i found a good price in amazon . i recommend if you want to have a piece of the best musical .
the action was good but i hate subtitles on these type of movies i wish amazon prime will come out with a way to change it to english
this movie teaches kids how to be better friends . another great disney film . our entire family loves it !
halloween is my favorite movie series . these are great movies ! we watch them about every october at least . michael myers is one of my all time favorite movie characters
in the simpsons the complete second season there are 22 episodes . it also has the best dvd extras that i have ever seen .
a very unique and beautiful story of a good family , you can see what was then and what is now . i really like the story , great video .
beautiful story , with a predictable little twist , but that did not spoil the plot . this is one funny , witty and very erotic movie . i enjoyed every minute of it .
i am a big fan of british series and this one fills the bill perfectly . drama , comedy and love all rolled into one
i 've been buying the seasons for my wife and she could n't be happier . now that she has them all she can go back and watch her favorites .
nick cage has stolen another couple hours from me . i ca n't help i just ca n't & # 34 ; put the bunny back in the box & # 34 ; .
i enjoyed this movie and found myself laughing throughout the whole thing . there were a couple parts that were n't as exciting as others but i would still highly recommend this . the whole storyline was great ! !
one of my favorite films , this dvd was a terrific addition to my film library and i 'd strongly recommend it to everyone .
this is a cute movie and we 've seen it many times . it is a classic and if you like billy crystal , you 'll find it funny and heart warming .
this is the one and only best version of the christmas carol on video . i would highly suggest if you like the story to purchase this version . you wo n't regret it .
i thought the movie was great , acting wise , but the plot kind of fell off towards the end . well written script but i wish there was a bit more to it than the way it ended .
i enjoyed watching it , however my grand kids got bored and took off to play . if you like cat in the hat , this one will be good too .
absolutely hilarious ! it does n't take religion seriously nor does it bad mouth religion . it just makes you look at things a little differently , which is what a good comedy does . i love it !
i bought this season used , and it came out good , everything played well . all the dvds played really well , none of them skip .
i would n't call the 2 hours a waste of time , but i know this is not a movie i will watch again .
do n't really see much of a difference from a regular dvd or a blu-ray but either way it 's a good movie !
this felt like is not at all going with all the rest of bourne movies and with ending be so open , we all agree this was just very poorly made
if you enjoy christmas then you must have this in your christmas move collection . this is a timeless family movie that is just a must have .
the first season was fantastic ! ! ! i enjoyed watching the interaction between the characters . the show is much better than the actual book !
this is one of perry 's movies that i enjoy quite a bit . i 've watched it a few times , and i 'm sure i 'll watch it some more .
we love them . the films are hilarious and quality historic entertainment that i share with my family and friends . new does n't always mean better .
i think this is one of the best movies and cher and nick were outstanding in it as were all the actors
i ordered this dvd and it was just what they said in good working order and clean no skips at all i had it with in one week very fast process and i will buy from them again
the kids love this . they received it as a gift and were so excited . it has four episodes . so far , it is a big hit !
good movie not as good as the first in the series but was okay . i do recomend it to friends .
a little too long , drag a bit . not as good as the last one . but still good action movie with wonderful graphics and animations .
i love the movies that disney puts their name on . they do a great job making family friendly movies . enjoyed watching it
a thrilling cold war story written by one of the great cold way spy thriller writers of all time . the move does the book justice , excellent cast . thrilling to the very end .
purchased this for a friend . this is the type of thing he like to watch and he was very happy with it . thank you !
the story was ok , but not intriguing . the act was terribly poor and boring . i can not understand how this pilot made it .
just right for grand children during moving time or taking trips in a vehicle . holds their attention quite well and not very many scary scenes .
i had this movie once before but we lost it in the move now i have it again and have watched it 4 times already !
the rock just keeps on getting better , i love the action and the plot of this movie , not to many low spots , great watching
this is a movie that is worth watching . it is very suspenseful and will keep you on the edge of your seat .
three 's company has alway made me laugh . i wish there were more episodes on the dvd though .
this is such a good movie ! i remembered watching it as a kid , and when i saw the great price , i had to get it . i 'm so happy i have it now !
this was n't even close to the book . i understand that the book is usually always better then the movie , but this was just bad ...
great blu-ray love watching tom and jerry on the big screen rate the blu-ray five stars it is worth it
we got 4 & 5 for christmas and have not gotten to 5 yet . we have the 2nd disc to go in series 4. this is a great series and wish there were more .
classic chevy chase comedy . i do n't know what to say other than this . if you like chevy chase comedy , then you 'll like this movie . watch it , you wo n't regret it .
these are both typical chuck norris movies . i really enjoy these and would purchase them again . these were good quality dvds .
this is hollywood at its best . story , acting and direction all working together to make a memorable and touching film based on a true story .
i was quite taken with the series and learned so much about ireland in general . the characters were well developed and i loved the story line . could n't stop watching it . recommend it to all .
i loved watching this movie when i was younger and i still love it today !
arrived quickly and in perfect condition . my parents have already watched all the movies and loved them ! !
great movie ! i loved watching it twice .it 's a classic now and i would recommend it for your enjoyment . having all three is great as well . under rated movies .
it arrived on time and works well . i love shopping with amazon . things are always as they appear and the prices are always reasonable .
good movie ! good story ! would be better if it is in color ! can it be remade in color ? i 'll buy one if it is in color .
bought it for a friend at work . watched it to see if i wanted a copy too . not my kind of movie .
wanted to add these to my collection , and at this price , i could not afford not to ! very happy with this dvd set ! !
just watched the movie and it brought back memories when i first saw it many years ago . goldie hawn was great in this movie .
it 's an entertaining movie ! just when you think you 've got it figured out , you 'll be surprised in the change of events . worth the rent !
started out an intriguing mystery but became a kind of stock story . worth seeing but not memorable . good for kids .
good sound and picture get to see neil off stage as well good live versions of some classic hits as well as newer ones a+
i enjoy a good a movie that keeps you on your toes . this one does and you are surprised at the ending .
great movie , great picture great sound and a lot of extras on the blu ray ... . must have for your anime collection
it takes a little while to get into it especially with this first season but after 3 or 4 episodes , you should get hooked .
another one of the stories that i did not relate too ( for some reason ) but i am sure others will rate it much higher .
this is a fun story for kids and adults to watch over and over again . a well thought out story with a good point .
after seeing previews on tv , i thought this would be a good movie . not so , it was a long , drawn out and boring movie and i would not recommend it .
great movie for a good price . i was actually looking for both the new and old movies and amazon was where i found them .
the great writing and the chemistry of the cast make this great comedy entertainment for young and old .
for all of us gay guys that are more interested in love and caring than just sex . love is all you really need .
brings me back to my childhood with this series . i was n't able to watch much television , but when i was , this was one of my favorites !
this was a very original movie . it was fairly well written and acted . it was probably the best movie experience i have had in quite some time . it 's worth your while to watch
was an all right movie . the kids did n't like it as much as we were expecting . not as kid friendly .
it was a gift for someone else and they like it and it was at a great deal and price
absolutely dumb ! there was a storyline you couldnt follow and the gore was lame in the parts you thought were gon na be the best . good actors but a horrible movie ... .
this is a great sci fi movie . and its stunning on hd dvd . if you have an hd set , you need this movie .
great movie very funny see it a long time ago and just had to have it on dvd to own
i love all of these movies . they are all classics and this a very great value to get all four of them in one set . you ca n't go wrong !
my grandson is into sports . when he ca n't play them , he likes to watch them . this dvd fit the situation . it provides hours of entertainment .
this is one of the best sci fi films in the last twenty years . such good action , acting , hot ladies . etc . you get it . buy it .
after watching season 1 , i went on to purchase all the seasons on dvd . one of the best written shows i 've seen . i 'm now watching this for the 2nd times !
typical adam sandler production , good story happy ending . hey i liked it you decide for yourself ! great for the family .
it was a great production , the acting was fantastic . a war picture that was more about the characters and their mission then just blood and gore
we enjoy the heroes and there stories and collect many of them and enjoy watching them many times with friends
this movie is incredibly sad , yet you feel a sense of hope in the boy , oliver . the songs are catchy and the timing is perfect !
this is one off my favorite cartoons . i 'm so glad i found it . it is one of the cutest cartoon movie . kids of all ages will like this movie .
a very good story that explains wonder woman 's life . the rest of the story is a great action story with some great with reference to greek mythology .
this movie is just stupid , do n't waste your money on this ! poor gore and poor make up and stupid acting ! just glad i never bought it . not even worth renting !
my kids and myself absolutely loved it , it 's funny , it 's sweet and most of all it 's totally entertaining . one of those movies you can watch over and over and still love it
very surprising . loved the singing . bought the cd also and love it . the actors and actresses were excellent . what else can i say , it was definitely a blast from the past .
amazon is the only place i buy dvds and cds they always come in good condition and very low prices .
this is a very touching movie with superb acting . it goes straight to your heart . it is one of the most romantic movies that i have ever seen . i highly recommend it .
this is another one for our john wayne collection . not a big fan of this type of movie , but we did want it just to have it in the collection .
i did n't get to see all the waltons when i was growing up . since i am older i really appreciate this show and it brings back a lot of good memories of the way i grew up
this movie is one of my all time favorites . great story . wonderful special effects . truly a must have for any sci-fi movie fan . pure enjoyment .
i love sinatra and like him in his later movies . it 's nice to be able to see him get better with age .
rocky has got to be my favorite movie of all time . a true inspirational story and a very well written screen play by sylvester stallone . totally recommended .
my kids loved this movie they were owned vhs before and lost it . thank you and have a nice day !
when i first watched this movie it made me cry on some of the parts but a great family movie to watch with the whole family
needed the first season to finish the series this is a great series i am so glad it finally came out on dvd for us all to enjoy .
if you have n't seen these movies you missed some great movies , both of these movies are timeless classics for your collections !
ted was a great movie unrated of course truly not fit for kids but it was really crazy i liked it
this show was always one of my favorites . i will watch it many times . the actors always do a good job .
if you ca n't afford the full season on dvd get this one instead . it has some of the funniest episodes on one dvd .
we happened across this originally on youtube and my son loves it . it gets annoying when playing for too long , but my kids find it so funny ( 1 and 2 years ) .
i would personally rate it 3 , but my husband really liked it . he is like a modern day dirty harry , but in a tv series .
loved this non vulgar version of a classic western movie . happy and sad at the very same time . loved it .
if you do not have this in your library then i suggest you buy it for sure ! keeps you on the edge of your seat . very action packed . i give 5 star
one of the best historically accurate war films ever . great action scenes , great cinematography the acting is good , location great and well balanced movie .

i love this movie . it is light and fun but still meaningful . goldie hawn is so funny in this . can keep re-watching .
it was a long silly movie . i can not understand how this movie could ever get 5 stars or any awards . it is absolutely a waste of money and time . the story
this is a great movie . it shows love compassion strength . and courage . i have told all my friends about this movie . thanks barbara
i enjoyed this one too . it is fun and clean ... typical of this decade . i find these movies refreshing since they focus more on the human aspect than a sexual one . nice .
have n't watched this yet because i got this dvd to add to my collection of tv shows that we watch .
the military is already training for this type of scenario . does n't surprise . i am surprised it has n't happened already . very well directed
thank you for putting this together , whoever you are . in my opinion , the first four seasons of happy days are the best , so on to # 4 !
good old fashioned scares . actors are great . the settings and the lighting helped keep me on the edge of my seat . really enjoyed .
this is a fun movie with fun acting and good actors . do n't take this too seriously and you will enjoy this movie .
great movie , kind of a chick flick with a great story line . and what makes it even better is that johnny depp is in it .
some movies are made for children ; this is one of them . it held the attention of my grandchildren and they loved it . that is all that matters . it was cute and funny .
sat down and watched it with my kids who are young teenagers . they loved it and they wanted watch again . great movie with good values in the end .
it 's a pretty decent movie . lots of action to keep you interested but it 's also very weird in the story and what 's going on
i had to get this dvd to add to my other shirley temple collection . watching her as a kid is one of my memorable memories .
love this program . it has action and some romance . very good and exciting , it is a must see show . love it !
it 's the only place i could find a blu-ray of & # 34 ; head & # 34 ; and am very satisfied with my decision / purchase .

i really love this movie . just a great , uplifting story and a feel good movie . a great soundtrack as well .
how can you not love the little mermaid ? this is a great price for a double pack and a good way to complete the little mermaid collection .
i like this one as much as the first , but i seem to watch this one more . the action , comedy , the supporting cast , everything made me like this . check it out .
the whole saw series is very good but the transition onto blu ray looks no different then it did on dvd
i loved the original story , i loved the movie as a kid , i still love it now as an adult , i have the whole collection now .
i liked this movie . i definately did n't see the story going in that direction so it definately helped it not to be so predictable .
my 3 1/2 year old granddaughter loves this and likes to watch it repeatedly . i love it because it is a lot of fun .
lots of action , which i love . and who does n't love & # 34 ; the rock & # 34 ; ? i would watch again . good story line .
we really enjoyed the movie . the color was good but the background music was too loud . the story line was very good .
great sandra bullock film to add to my sandra bullock library of her old and new films . nicole kidman is also great .
i bought this for my daughter because she wanted a work out video that had easy moves and good music ... she loves it ! ! !
a good plot to the movie . very believable flying action . the acting was good . always got to have a hot head in every movie . already suggested friends to watch it
... movies ever made . how anyone could rate this less than 5 stars is beyond me .
its timeless . its awesome . u cant beat blu ray . u need to buy it to believe how cool it sounds and looks ! !
though this movie had many well known movie stars , i did not find it interesting enough to even finish watching .
great acting , story line , another outside of the box approach to one of the greatest figures of all time ... son of god ?
i do n't know what more to say . i love criminal minds , it 's one of my faves . and this is definitely a good season , full of drama . you 'll love : ) .
this is a great movie . the story is original and the movie was very well done . i hope they continue this series the way this movie was done , a must see !
richard gere plays a different side then i am use to . you kind of hate him and love him in this movie .
entertaining for a moment , but cheap tricks and cameos are n't enough . i ca n't even remember the major plot points . i would pass on this in the future .
this is a well done mini series . the acting is superb and the story is rich . i found it to be funny .
the movie , at its core , is a good movie ; yet , i found it to be long and dragged out , at times . could have been better ...
i have always enjoyed disney movies - animated or not . this was well written and fun to watch , i would highly recommend .
i really enjoyed watching the series its so hard to find a good sci fi . would have enjoyed a fifth season
we love disney movies and toy story 1 & 2 are both awesome movies . this is a classic that will always be loved by children of all ages .
i loved the history in this movie . i found it very inspiring and think that all americans should listen to the message !
the first season of charles in charge is great , but it gets much better throughout season 2. i really hope universal releases season 2 soon .
this was one of my husbands fathers day gifts . need more steven seagal movies as he is so crazy about his movies .
story line could have been so much more . i found it hard to follow . i watched it a second time and caught some things , but there are still some things that i have not figured out .
i actually liked the original better - i did n't think the acting was as good as it could have been
plenty of it in all of them . cast and characters superb . i 'll never tire of watching them .
a visually stunning movie ! this movie is just beautiful to look at and sometimes i forget to follow the storyline . the story is classic and told well .
i was raised on westerns and this one does n't disappoint ! buy it , pop some popcorn and enjoy !
i find myself looking forward to watching each new episode . i like mystery type programs instead of reality drama shows . this one is a home run for me .
not my cup of tea but my wife can not get enough of this show . it is a laugh fest for those who like that kind of humor .
great movie . have loved this movie since it first came out in the theater . the special features on this dvd are also very fun to watch as well .
we purchased this shrek dvd to replace an old vhs copy . now we have the whole set on dvd - older kids still love it !
this is a great movie just started watching it and its awesome ... ! ! ! i cant wait to get home and watch the rest ... ! ! !
cameron diaz is always entertaining . she is very funny in this movie . it is a little raunchy at times . this is a fun movie to watch .
jason statham had hair ! ! ! it was nice to watch him in another part , then we are used to seeing him .

great deal ! i could n't pass this offer up , as it is rare to have this price on a disney blu ray .
since i have not received this dvd i can not really give an opinion , but am sure i will enjoy it when it gets here .
love this movie ! ! ! bought this after having numerous friends talking about it and i have loved every minute of it ! !
i really liked this series , even though i do n't really believe in revenge . it explores the good and bad about revenge , and is quite a sad show .
too too many people have tried making horror spoof movies , and this is the only one that did it well .
excellent movie if you enjoy action packed movies . all the guys in the movie played a perfect part for their role in the movie .
but i ca n't do any better . this is really a super performance .
this is a great and funny movie that all ages would enjoy . it will make you laugh and cry . i highly recommend it .
this is a nice set and will be a great addition to any american dad fan . there is nothing special about it or the packaging but you get the most important thing the episodes .
what a great sense of the 1950 's gone space age . the look and the characters are great . this is a fun film .
this movie is great , have always liked this show . love the songs and music as well as the comedy plus a love story . would recommend this movie to all who wants fun .
i have only used this once and did n't particularly like it . although , it did give me a fairly good workout . it is not my favorite dvd . but , would recommend it .
this is a great show and the fifth season was amazing . glad i own this .
i really liked this movie a lot . it has everything you want to watch in a movie . it is a great movie ! !
father ted is just fun . not unlike the three stooges no deep message here just a joy to watch . very funny stories .
how can you go wrong with a ( 3 ) movies with john wayne he is great . all 3 movies were great
i enjoyed this movie and thought all the actors did a great job . i may actually purchase this so i can enjoy it many more times .
no particular words can rate this hitchcock movie except that it 's a & # 34 ; wonderful classic & # 34 ; ! ! one of his best ! ! great buy .
the movie was very good , even if it was sad . the actors did a great job . most women would enjoy this movie .
this is probably the best mini doc ive ever seen of probably the three greatest musicians of our time ! highly reccomend if you 're a fan of one or all three .
a thin book , but worth the price . she is obviously a loving dog owner but also a good teacher . i understand what my dogs are telling me much better since reading her book .
the pirates of the caribbean series in general is one of the best set of movies out there for people who like action , romance , and witty humor . definitely watch this movie , and its sequels .
i never saw the movie . i thought i purchased a dvd and discovered too late that it was digital to be used on the computer only . we ca n't watch movies on our computer .
clean cut , entertaining movie , would recommend to anyone , especially if you grew up in a large family or wanted to know what it would be like to grow up in a large family
good way to relive your childhood and enjoy a good tv show were you know good and evil was so must buy
bought this movie because it was based on a true story and that can make a slow movie worth watching if you like that type movie .
at first i thought it was going to be lame and cheesy but it turned out way better then i expected ! ! ! !
my husband and i have always loved this movie and i am glad to have it in dvd ! the special effects are great !
it 's so funny and cute . kept the whole family entertained the entire film . we usually just rent movies but we actually bought this movie .
it was a really good show , and i recieved it fast it was packaged very well , a movie the whole family could watch
my daughter has been watching this movie since she was about 9 months old and at 2 years old this is still one of her top favorite movies . it was the first movie to make her laugh .
i thought this movie was decent overall . better than i expected . it kept me interested , what can i say .
search for this movie for sometime - hard to find a place that carries old movies - came on time .
this show is great and wonderful entertainment for the entire family . you do n't get many shows like this any more . if you do n't own it , what are you waiting for ?
bought for my daughter . watched it and was pleased . sometimes i have to watch a chick flick to get back to reality .
although this version has no big name stars , it was the version my daughter and rest of family would watch together each week on pbs . we enjoyed it as great family entertainment .
this movie is an old favorite and first introduced me as a child to morgan freeman . i cry every time i watch this movie .
a real waste of time ! you might like this if your jewish but then again you might be more offended too !
this is a great movie . thanks for getting this movie to me on time and in one piece . john wayne is one of my favorite actors .
late to the party on this series but now i am completely hooked . i think the next couple seasons will only get better .
very fun . lots of innovative twists with the different monsters . good message for parents and kids . i enjoyed it a lot more than i expected to .
love the movie ... love dennis quaid and julia roberts as well as robert duvall and the other actors . it is funny and entertaining and well worth watching .
love having this show on dvd because i can skip the segments about george 's parents . they are they only dull point in an otherwise amazing series .
i have never seen this show , so i was so glad to see the complete series on dvd . have n't watched yet , as i am watching something else .
state and main is a witty , intelligent , and funny movie . worth owning .
love this story and all the bugs . disney did great job on this one . perfect for young children . loved it
funny ... never thought about it ... bateman is only one letter away from batman ! one of the greatest psycho thrillers ever . if you have not seen this movie you are just wrong .
they do n't make movies like this anymore . chevy chase was king of comedy when this was made . i will buy more of his movies .
we watched this movie and it is something that all families should watch . i would recommend this to any one
pretty neat premise with lots of twists and turns . a bit predictable by today 's standards but still a great movie that stands the test of time .
i had a friend over and since she had not seen it , we watch together . it was delightful . very entertaining .
the product arrived in excellent conditions and in time . and the product itself is great .
great movie . if you have never seen this movie , it is a great kid movie . there is also a second one that is good too .
suppose it could be called chick flick with a difference ... but still well beloved and does n't disappoint - if i say that over and over it is because it is true and so seldom is !
pretty good subject but i honestly thought it 'd be a better movie . it 's an ordinary comedy while this subject could make a wonderfully amazing movie .
i received the movie quickly and i have enjoyed watching it with my son . i hope that they will make more . : )
got this as a gift for my grandson , have not watched it yet , so hoping the dvd is in good working condition , would recommend this site
goldie hawn and kurt russell are delightful together in this dvd that i have seen many times on video tape .
loved the first 2 movies , but the 3rd one was lame . otherwise , i would have given the set a 5 star rating .
what a wonderful combination . the movies are amazing ! i 'm so glad to have these movies in my collection ! thank you !
if you like linda blair you will try to get as many movies as you can with her in them . ca n't say it was great but is great for my collection .
love this movie very suspensful and awesome very well worth purchasing who highly recommend this to who anyone who loves suspensful movies
i 've only watched half of this at this point but it 's already got me hooked . i enjoy history anyway and this keeps your attention .
this was a xmas gift for my son , so i know he has enjoyed it , but i ca n't say i have watched it at all . but he wanted more info and movies on world wars .
meh . liked the other bourne movies much better . did i mention it seemed really long ? in short , not worth the time .
it 's one of those movies that i grew up watching . it 's not meant to be plausible , it 's not meant to make sense . it 's just meant to be fun .
i just like dr , who with tom baker the story is great , clean , and action . and the ladies that work with him are also great . for me he is the best doctor who
i purchased this for one of my sons for one of his christmas presents . he loves the spartacus series and i will purchase any further series for him .
it was very enjoyable movie . it was non stop action . it was an effective background for the lord of the rings trilogy .
enjoyed different episodes and were good family entertainment . had seen some before but good value for the price . whole family could watch .
it truly is a family movie and is one of my favorites . i do n't think this movie ever received the attention it should have . imagine star trek for real but , funny : - )
bringing up baby is fun . i saw this movie when i was a kid , then after i discovered it at amazon i new i had to buy it .
this dvd came promptly after ordering . it came as stated on the amazon website . i am very happy with my purchase , and i would recommend them to others .
you 've got to see this if you have n't already , and if you have , see it again ! it 's great ! ! loved it !
kept me guessing and was an interesting story . i thought it had a nice twist for the ending and was fun to watch .
different take on a famous historical figure but quite enjoyable nonetheless . especially good to watch in 3-d as the special effects really come to life in such mysterious ways . worth checking out .
i did n't particularly like this movie . it was dated , plot moved very slow and in fact my wife and i turned it off before the end because it was getting to be boring .
this was better than the last one . i 'm sure it will be popular . just not my favorite . a bit predictable .
the world has been saved . a great scary movie for everyone who is anyone . bravo .
came before it was promised it the shape it was promised and it 's just a great all around movie . l
what 's not to like , and blu-ray makes it even more wonderful . everything works to make this classic a wonderful view to keep .
denzel was great as always and i loved the fact that he owned up to being drunk and not putting it on his dead friend .
we watched this movie with my mom who had not seen the movie but had read the books over 30 years ago . she loved it and is looking forward to seeing other movies that she has not seen
i havent watched this movie yet but i have read the book and one of my friends said the movie went well with the book so i am sure i will love it
one of my most favorite movies that i re-watch all year . like the story , the characters , the setting , the family !
bruce willis makes the ultimate sacrifice to save the planet ... it moves me every time i watch it , just plain awesome !
this is the real aliens movie , not the knock off . great acting , award winning graphics and effects . highly recommend this movie .
i remember reading this when it came out in comic book form , the artwork and story are very true to the original .
i rented the hunger games first because i wanted to make sure i loved it as much as the books . when i ordered the 2 disc dvd , i was impressed with all the extra features !
received these dvd 's in a timely manner in good condition . these are great . tom selleck is the perfect actor for these .
awesome anime movie one of the best out there and awesome voice actors love it
this movie was not what i had expected however , it was a very heart felt movie . i do recommend everyone give this one a watch .
good action movie . i like anything with bruce willis and this was not a disappointment . if you like this kind of movie , this would appeal to you .
i just love the charlie chan movies i like the old black and white movies i think they are best they dont make movies like that any more .
there 's not much to say . great movie . i had it on vhs . i needed a clean version for my dvd collection . it a class of it 's own .
again , this is one of my husband 's favorite movies and he 's enjoying it a lot . thanks for a quality product .
i enjoyed this movie very much it was entertaining and kept my interest . i would like to have more movies as good as this available on amazon prime . i may even watch it again .
it is what it is , a kids movie . it is ok for kids up to 13 yrs old . do n't take teenagers . they are going to want to leave half an hour after starting .
this one was n't as good as i hoped it would be . the ending is n't what i wanted and i guess i hated to see it end a series of shows that i loved .
this is a fantastic movie . some historical mistakes like there was never a car chase , but that 's hollywood . ben is fantastic .
i bought this dvd collection mainly for scream of fear , but the other movies are solid , too . you just ca n't go wrong with some hammer horror !
this movie has lots of sex and twists to it . i liked it for the most part .
loved it . so excited to have this in my collection . ca n't wait for the rest of the episodes to come out .
thanks for the great dvd and the wonderful memories too ! now i can rewatch when i want ! ! ! thanks for the memories
another movie that the trailer was better than the movie . just a terrible movie to watch and sorry i did .
i 've loved this movie since the first time i saw it at the theater . now i can watch it as many times as my husband watches his favorite war movies .
i was disappointed with this movie . there was nothing special about the storyline that kept me on the edge of my seat .
as with all things i order on `` amazon.com '' , i received the dvds earlier than anticipated . i was very pleased . in fact , i just ordered more dvds from amazon.com yesterday .
i had seen this years ago when it first came out but i wanted to see again ... .it 's really good without being corny .
kind of a crazy movie , funny sad , weird at times but over all a good movie . you will enjoy it .
the movie was good but i did not care too much for this documentary . but for sure you should catch the movie .
i ca n't say much about the movie because i have never seen the movie . my daughter is the scary movie fan in the family and she says it was great .
this is a very entertaining movie . getting a chance to see a cg version of what ancient rome looked like is worth the purchase price alone .
i 've ordered every season and know it will probably come to an end soon . if you enjoy british police dramas , then this series is for you . it 's worth the $ .
i enjoyed this movie . it 's definetly best described as cute . i did not realize it was not actually in french though ! i would recommend it .
i loved the story - it was well done but the quality of this picture was a two star .
i much say , it 's an excellent movie . action packed as all of vin 's movies . the cast was excellent . it was so good , i watched it 3 times in 24 hours .
it 's a great restoration of the theatrical presentation . i 've only seen it on commercial tv previously and have seen parts of the movie that i 've never seen before
matthew mcconaughey is awesome in his role . he should have gotten an oscar for it . his partner in the movie was awesome as well .
i gave it 3 stars because it was n't as good as the first hunger games . now i know that a 3rd will be made and i hope it is better .
now this is what movie making is all about . two thumbs up all the way - five stars - a masterpiece .
the people were very good actors , interesting to watch , not boring and lots of twists and turns in this mystery . good quality dvd , played good .
we can not go to the movies , so we buy them . this was a great flick . it was great make believe .
the movie was very good and also the acting . it really lets you know what this family went through to find each other and is a true story . very sad but good ending .
i very much enjoyed this little film that i had never heard of before . only an hour & a half , well worth killing some time over .
this is one of the best romantic comedy film , i love all the main characters here , great story , great characters and great acting !
i grew up on johnny quest and the hardy boys . i love how this show takes it to both youth classics .
i chose 5 stars as it exceeded my expectations ! ! ! this series is very suspenseful . i 'd reccomend this set to anyone .
this is a good muppets movie and keeps the kids attention . this is one of their best i think and worth the money
this movie is really awesome . it is really funny and has plenty of action . the ending is unpredictable .
the dvds came ahead of time . work perfectly and i found the show to be enjoyable and entertaining . it 's just a shame there were so few episodes .
i gave this movie as a gift , person i gave it too enjoyed it thoroughly , i thought it was given too much hype
this movie was stupid and i might watch it again , but it will be a while and it will probably be by accident .
very good movie with lots of action and also a good story to go with it , enjoyed watching it over and over
the audio and video quality of this movie was extremely poor , not clear at all and lots of audio noise too
the regular dvd edition is better quality then the blu-ray . there are no special features . its also in french . not sure why this version sucks .
really enjoyed the movie , thought both leads were somewhat believable . if you like johnny cash then do not miss it .
i like these types of movies and enjoy it very much . price was right and quick shipping compared to some other online sites . the movie is a must see for those who enjoy the sci fi approach .
i thought the picture was clean and the sound great . it felt like you were in a movie theatre . i like the price of this blu ray
excellent story line and twists throughout that will keep you guessing until the very last frame . good drama , good action , and good suspense . what more could you ask for ?
just went ahead and bought it finally . a must have film for chick flick lovers . terrific cast and very well acted .
best investment i ever made ! if you are a west wing fan , pick up this collection . you will not be sorry !
this is one of the more enjoyable movies in my kids collection for us all to watch together . great movie for the whole family
this is the first of the twilight saga . it is a great movie ! i would for sure recommend it to anyone in the world ! !
loved the way he teaches and the information in this dvd . ca n't wait to get the rest of the passion talk series .
one of my husband 's favorite movies and my son watched it for the first time with us . love the movie . great quality and will definitely watch again i am sure .
well i knew that it was something like men in black but i can not say that i really enjoyed it .
i bought this series because i enjoyed watching it when it was first produced - the acting is excellant and the story is good - i do enjoy it !
my kids love this movie am not sure why its kind of creepy i think . my sister sad its scary but its not scary looking to me . any ways very pleased and great price !
our purchase and delivery of the product was a wonderful experience ! to top it of , the condition in which the product was sent was exceptional ! we are very satisfied on the overall .
this is awful . with sandler all talking in a weird voice , pretty awful . and the animation wasnt even that good .
i would recommend this to anyone who is wanting to keep the trash of today 's t.v . programs out of their children 's minds .
it 's hard to say what i think about this . it is really interesting . but overall only worth seeing once . at least that is how it is with me .
i really like this movie cause it is old and romantic . it is long and that is good and the actors are great .
this is one of my favorite movies of all time . if you have n't watched it ... you should !
the fact that it is based on a true story was remarkable ! had to listen closely at times as the accent got me sometimes - very good movie .
i think this should be the last in this series . the characters are getting tired and need to be put to rest and a new series started .
if you are a die hard phantom fan , you will enjoy this second film . it has a few twists and an interesting ending .
excellent movie . so nice to see no violence on this just plain fun film . all the actors are clean cut mostly and a joy to watch
this is a fantastic movie and is one of our favorites . i thought i had already replaced the vhs copy so when i realized i did n't i had to get it .
no other words necessary except that johnny depp is the coolest ( next to keith of course in the next movie ) ca n't wait for the sequel ! ! !
i had never seen this movie before so had no idea of what to expect . it was enjoyable yet sad at times . i am glad i picked the movie .
arrive on time and in perfect condition . it 's so nice to be able to watch a singer sing . love this dvd . thanks you !
excellent series ! the greatest series that has ever been on tv . this is series that i ca n't get enough of ! i would recommend this series to anyone who loves good tv shows !
excellent cast and character development ; good story . this was a fast moving plot with characters that immediately got your attention .
this movie was so lame i do n't know where to start . the only good thing is the story line had potential . it was just not put together very well .
great movie about the values of life - faith , honor , courage , and helping others achieve their dreams : ) . loved every minute of it !
highly recommend this movie . great acting and great story . plan on buying the book and the movie it is based on .
i enjoyed watching it . it was n't as intense as the first two but still good to watch .
a `` chic flick '' for certain but one any ( mature ) chic would enjoy . another oldie but goodie . cute plot and well acted .
finally this saga comes to blu-ray in the only edition that matters , extended . finally comes alive the way you wanted it to !
movie came early and played well , no problems at all , was a good movie to watch for some good entertainment
i had already seen the made for t.v . movie so i knew what to expect . i enjoyed the story and delivery of the product was wonderful . that is why i deal with amazon .
sorry but this was not my kind of movie.i only watched part of it and really could not get into it . the acting was not that good and to much nudity . i will not recommend this movie .
this is one of the all time great series from hbo ! ! and as good as the first season is , it only gets better and better ! ! ! ! nice play , amazon : )
fun , goofy , full of adventure , good actors , odd slap stick , never ending , slightly predictable . clean fun . kids will love it .
i love step brothers and watch when i need mindless laughing . will ferrell is hilarious in my opinion and this movie is no exception .
this movie had no purpose . i did not like it and hate that i spent the money to buy it . it was not what i expected . i was bored with it and never finished watching it .
this is a cute movie . my 3 kids love it as well as the other two movies . i recommend for your disney collection .
have n't watched the entire series yet but am finding this series simply wonderful .
i really ca n't say anything more about this movie other than what has already been said . just a freaking awesome movie !
we watch this because my husband want to and it was a good cowboy movie . it did have some moments in it that i would have not seen but over all it was a good movie .
first season is the best ... although you can get it in the colorized version , i prefer black and white . it 's classic and i enjoy watching it over and over !
i love this series ! so funny and entertaining . i ca n't wait for the rest of the seasons to come out on dvd .
i watched this show since it was first aired and it is such a great balance of drama and humor and a great story line .
this is a good movie , especially if you like the music of glenn miller . it 's a bit slow but overall good .
i am rating this movie low both on the quality of the image and the film content itself . a bad movie with bad image quality . avoid at all cost .
this dvd was purchased as a christmas gift . my husband really enjoys this movie . the dvd had good quality sound and picture .
great movie for kids . hope they keep making more . the grandsons loved it . made a great gift . did n't worry about them watching it .
i love watching good hero movies and when i saw this in the theatre , i had to add it to my dvd collection .
this show is a classic . it is great and well worth the money when you find it on sale , which is often . the dvd came in one piece and brought back memories !
i very much enjoyed the movie , it was funny and delightful to watch . i 've seen some of the previews of the title and could hardly wait to get it .
this maybe old tv show but was still as interesting as it was years ago liked seeing the old faces again the new movie made us want to go back and get the old tv series to watch
had the vhs but wanted the dvd this worked perfectly and is exactly what i needed to update my collection .
my kids enjoyed this series so much better than the new stuff so i decided to order all the seasons .
had n't really heard much about this before i got it but got it based on reviews . the kids loved it and the story was good and safe for the young ones . overall , very good movie
i watched with my wife and daughter , they were on edge most of the movie . i liked all the action . not a bad rendition of a zombie movie .
great set of movies at a great price . got this blu-ray set when it was on special . ca n't beat it .
this was a huge series when i was in high school , everyone i knew , even teachers talked about it the next day .
well , what to say , most of these `` types '' of movies just suck , but this one was good . watch it , good funny movie
my kids love it but i 'm a little tired of it . but they like the songs and they like the story .
i bought it because i was searching for some movies to watch , and it was cheap so i guess you get what you pay for . it was not bad just somewhat cheesy sometimes .
was a very good movie but not what i expected however i would recommended it since it was very good watching .
the one that started it all . ordered this for my dad as well . i like this one the best out of all the movies .
these two movies are both very good choice 's for viewing on a family movie night . adults and children will enjoy them
only down side was it did not last long enough . it was just a mini series of a few shows
another amazon deal of the day with a great show like this how could i pass it up ... .
i loved this so much i ordered the 2 disc version . i love the music and the voices . and i would have chosen the phantom .
very fine copy of an all time classic . the lead actors are stunning and the writing is outstanding .
love this movie , great adaptation of the serial novel by stephen king . when i first saw this movie i could n't believe stephen king wrote the novel this was based on .
we bought this after renting , then buying super 8 on dvd , which got scratched because it was n't put back in the case . then we got a bluray player and decided this was a must buy !
i loved this film . it was incredibly funny , sweet and just well done all the way around . it had good writing , acting and directing . i laughed my butt off all the way through .
my 3 year old watches this over and over . this is one of her favorite movies and has a good plot . she is learning and having fun at the same time .
this is a classic redford movie . we watch this every christmas season and on blue ray the scenery is even more gorgeous .
this anime i can say met all expectations . it was just like how i remembered and i can recomend it to anime fans . in fact a friend also said it was good .
i really love this movie . i have watched this show for more than 10 times . fast pace and great effects . for me , it is a must have dvd .
always loved this film and now so do both of my daughters . a fun film with lots to think about .
this movie was n't as good as we thought it would be . i really would n't recomend it .
the original is hard to beat but they changed it up a little and did a pretty good job with the story .
most movies do not often beat the first or continue to get better . i was really happy with this movie . surprisingly moving and entertaining .
fans of the show are just fans of the show . i 'm a fan of the show ... one of the best and funniest tv shows ever ! !
the picture on the cover of this dvd gave us the impression that the quality would be better than it turned out to be . this was extremely disappointing !
excellent movie . the dvd is remastered and looks great from the old vhs version . a must have for lucille ball fans .
my mom loves this movie , so i thought i surprise her with an early christmas present . she was very happy to see it again .
this was a fantastic movie . i really enjoyed the special affects . ill be watching this one again for sure . .
it 's one and still one of his best films - not for kids but a great film and will always watch it every so often
have been collecting them for a while . would get more if i had the money . retired now and now working .
cute and funny and the ending was not what i expected . wo n't give it up so you have to see it for yourself .
i love this movie as a child and wanted to share with another child ! sharing is a good thing to teach children .
i love this movie . it is a tradition at our house to watch this at christmas . i highly recommend this movie .
barbra streisand 's best work is in this movie ! too much fun and watchable more then once .
how can anyone resist jane austen ? this is a very good adaption of jane austen 's & # 34 ; pride and prejudice & # 34 ; . i enjoyed it very much .
low budget , but pretty entertaining . lots of funny lines and other entertaining things . the acting is not as bad as many reviewers say . i have seen lots worse .
this is a great tv show even though some of the characters are off the wall . it still holds your interest .
this movie is fantastic ! ! ! ! it is an adventure classic . we all know the ending , but it is an all time favorite ! !
a classic performance by a great canadian and who is just amazing , can listen to leonard all day . awsome cd
this is a visually beautiful picture , it is well acted and i think the actors match the characters , not very deep , just an enjoyable evening .
i have loved this film since i was a child watching these war time movies . i was very happy to be able to buy once for my own collection of classic films .
five star movie . great acting , spectacular scenery , good character development , and much historical information about ww ! ! . wish i had know it was based on a true story before i actually watched it .
i enjoyed the movie very much . it was not only about fast and furious driving but a good story line . the characters were very good . i loved it .
the story was changed slightly , probably to make it more politically correct . the acting was no where as good as the old version . the songs were not very good.i was bored .
i used to have this move on vhs and i really loved it . tom hanks and meg ryan are great in this romantic movie .
good picture quality and a pleasure to watch - i am glad i bought this title as it is fun and makes me feel happy .
was a funny and overall great movie . my 2 year old grandson sat and did n't move threw the whole movie .
i enjoy watching all of their movies . i am watching house party as i type this and that is a classic movie as well .
you must watch it to believe it ! ! ! it can not and will not disappoint you . you will not not regret purchasing this ! !
loved this animation ... great message ... gave as christmas gift ... good for young and old alike ... can watch this over and over again .
it 's just a dvd set of my favorite era of wrestling . its the greatest matches ever . we watch it non stop
love one tree hill . my girls are really getting into it and loving it also , really enjoying it . thank you .
awesome - action packed and complex storyline as we are getting with the new bond movies . watched it with my 11 and 13 yr old boys - we loved it .
this movie did the tv series no justice at all . i never watched the tv show , but i heard it was pretty good -- this was terrible .
alex cross is a change for tyler perry . however , it is worth watching . i found it to be different , but entertaining .
great fun ! . if you like british shows and specially dr. who . its the bomb ! i hope they come back . enjoy !
i never saw it coming , great thriller without all the gore that other scary movies have . it had suspense , intrigue , with a twist . i would definitely recommend it .
i so enjoy watching downton abbey each sunday night . it will again be a long wait for season 4 to begin .
i love this movie and if you are a barbra streisand fan it is worth buying ... it is a movie i enjoy watching over and over again .
i watched this again here recently after seeing it several years ago . great actors and a great plot . will probably watch it again in a couple of more years .
this movie is okay , but i would not really recomend it for young children . there are a few messages that young children might not understand .
it was nice to get one more chance to see the gang . happy endings all the way around . perhaps not quite as magical as the original series , but still very enjoyable .
how wonderful to watch something clean and fun . i found myself smiling after every episode .
this was a gift for my son . i think he 's watched the whole series through about four times and will watch it again .
great movie with great actors and an exciting plot . it is not to be missed and you wo n't be disappointed .
absolutely heart warming , entertainment . no violence , cursing , sex , just wholesome entertainment with excellent acting . everyone below the age of 40 should be required to watch it !
i really liked this movie - if you are looking for suspense and a good story try this movies ! i was pleased with my purchase !
this is a very good mini series . if you like science fiction and an all around great story with very good acting . watch this ! ! ! !
this was a sit up and take notice kind of story and kept me on the edge of my seat throughout much of the picture . very good suspense .
there , s plenty of action in this film . victor mature played a good part in helping the soldiers bring peace with the indians .
as with all the previous series , series 5 continues the tradition of smart , witty , and very human comedy . where is series 6 ? ? ?
if you like sherlock holmes this is a good place to start a collection and a really good movie to watch
this one & # 34 ; grew & # 34 ; on me . some words hard to understand but will probably enjoy watching again .
this is one of the funniest sitcoms around . definitely worth watching . jason bateman is great , as are the other actors .
there is no information as to whether this blu-ray is the theatrical cut , or the far superior director 's cut . if it is not the dc , i will not be purchasing this .
love the movie when i was a kid , brings back times when i was young . great movie and would highly recommend if you grew up in the 60 's .
it great price for clint eastwood movies if you like boxing or space movies . my husband enjoy all the movies in this set
this is the second part . it was very violent and bloody . it was an interesting look at the development of this criminal and how he got to his end . subtitled and definitely not for children .
this was purchased as a gift for my daughter . she will be happy to have this in her personal library .
we had it on tape and then our vcr went bad on the tv . so when i found it on amazon . i had to get it . we watched it on christmas day . it was great
film is really outdated but i was interested in how rating system came all about
this is a movie for my mother she really likes funny make you feel good movies this is a very good movie to see and enjoy with anyone
fun and a decent action film , but a bit too predictable if you are looking for suspense .
this , in my opinion is one of the best films ever made . scary as hell , beautiful to look at , great acting all around . just watch it you have n't yet .
this is one to watch over and over again and can enjoy with your family . you will be captivated by this and anyone watching this with you will be captivated as well . i highly recommend this .
nothing good on tv , i go to amazon and watch instant videos & i like the older shows like cheers !
although the story line is a bit different that the book i did enjoy the movie . i would watch it again .
he 's a kid who has everything , so it is difficult to tell when something is exceptional ; however , he did view these and seemed to enjoy them .
it 's not my favorite movie , but it was pretty good , and even a little funny .
it 's an ok movie . not in the class of the first expendables . heroes coming out of nowhere to save the day . ok
received dvd on time and in good shape . this is one of my favorite tv shows .
some ! great price ! arrived on time ! perfect condition ! and it 's an awesome family movie to watch during halloween or whenever ! i would recommend the movie , item and seller . two thumbs up .
a fabulous movie that was perfectly cast , acted , and directed . i read the book and saw the movie twice . i recommended it to everyone i knew . the perfect movie for dialogue lovers .
it is such a classic movie . if you love the old horror movies you definitely should add this to your collection . my granddaughter loved it at 7 yrs old .
this is a classic that the whole family can watch and enjoy i could watch this one over and over
this was a gift for my daughter and she was very happy with it . we will recommend it to others who like this type of animation .
great ! we all love raymond . we like the commentaries of the writer 's too . that really adds to the enjoyment of the episodes .
alot better then the first movie , as long as you remember that this is a comic book version so it should not be realistic but just intertaining . alot of action .
i 'm not much for tv programs but i loved the movie . the story lines were good and i just loved everything about it . special effects were wonderful
i love it and i enjoy it very much , this product have very good quality and i will recommend to all my friends , thank you
great show wish he never went nuts . . . . . . . . . . . . ..
got it for father 's day present for my husband . he loves it . watches it all the time .
i 've enjoyed this movie since it was first released in theaters . it 's so much fun - the characters , the situations , even the end credits are funny .
i can watch this with my boys and even get lost in the story at times . ca n't wait for season 4
disney has done it again . this will be a classic . everyone loved watching it , from young to old . love the theme and songs !
i remember watching this as a child . i enjoyed it just as much as an adult . something about doris day that is timeless .
finally a date movie that i was n't rolling my eyes the whole way through ! i loved it ! the ending was perfect . i do n't understand why it got such bad reviews ... .
a good film in the buddies series for all ages . they are given super powers and help out the true owner of the rings .
we really enjoy this series . the cast is excellent and the stories are entertaining . i recommend this very fine tv show .
pretty decent and entertaining movie , not of the kind you 'll never forget , but a sweet story with some humor , nice .
i like it , but i wish it was digital , i would probably use it more . i was amazed at how good i felt afterwards .
my husband and i love the british comedies . this is his favorite . i think we have every one that has come out so far . excellent seller to work with .
movie received and was in very good condition , bought the movie for my grandson but enjoyed watching it with him !
i 've loved this movie since i first saw it in the theater . what a great suspenseful movie . clint is the best !
this movie was a bit different . not really a feel good but was n't bad . liked david hugh jones . the movies was a bit slow as well .
any real fan will love this season . the price is not that bad either ...
the acting awesome , the premise of this film is very innovative . scary but one day that may be the world we are all living in .
what can you say about this movie that has n't already been said . it is 50 years old but just as good now as then .
any texas fan must have this for all the extras on this version of the classic film and uncut finally
loved this movie and the actors were great . storyline was amazing and i loved the ending . thanks for making this .
i watched series 1 thru 4 and just had to have series 5 and now ca n't wait for series 6 ... .
not one that i would care to watch again but do not feel my time was wasted for watching it once .
interesting and some education . not a family movie . it 's more for couples that been married for a while . some interesting and funny things that come up .
good movie , well cast and you cared about the characters . however the ending was predictable ... maybe just because i would have liked a happy ending .
i 'm glad i bought this one because it is fantastic . i thought it would be some & # 34 ; b & # 34 ; thing , but it was absolutely great . must see !
this is the best one yet out of all them if you are a fan you will love this move
plot not well developed . did not leave me riveted to the screen . the dialog could have been better . some character could have been better developed .
after watching these films you have to wonder why eastwood would attempt comedy . but the movies are great ; well made and engrossing . but this is n't the collection to watch back to back .
this is a must have for any adventure time fan . though a few of the dvd 's have some repeat content . it 's still worth owning them all .
this is a great movie and my girlfriend had never seen it . read the description and if you think the story is even slightly interesting give it a shot . you will enjoy it .
i love this , i watch this with my children and they loved it to . i grew up watching this and it still holds it 's own .
it was good to see arnold back again . he is not as buff as he used to be , but he does still have that screen presence .
happy to have found these for our grandson to watch . his father enjoyed them every saturday growing up now his son can enjoy them too .
sean penn is so good in this movie . it is a really good movie and it is true ,
i really liked this movie ! it brought back a lot of memories of the way it is way down south . great action , just everything ! i loved it !
i first saw this movie years ago and fell in love with it . it is so true to life . thanks
i love this movie ! it 's cute and funny and the whole family can watch it . i highly recommend it to all .
very good randolph scott western excellent movie i like all westerns by randolph scott he was a very good actor they dont make westerns like this any more you will like this one .
love this movie . it has everything a movie should have ( love , mystery and action packed ) .
watched all episodes of this and enjoyed them very much . the british know how to make a movie . i recommend them .
tom selleck has always been a favorite of mine , and i was not disappointed with these dvds . they are great , and i really enjoyed watching them !
this a great movie . hands down the greatest trilogy of all-time . it is a must own on dvd . bought this for a gift . great seller and item came new and sealed .
this is truly a movie gem - if you have n't seen this move - it is a must see . every couple of years pull it out and re-watch - it holds up to the test of time .
i received the movie die hard 2 within a week in great condition . i 'm very pleased with the movie and the service .
great story . truly a lost artist . another good example of remaining true to yourself . nice story that is uplifting . well worth owning or renting .
really good movie -- the opening scene , was a classic ... .. the new version of this movie will be just as awesome
extremely funny . have been in some of the situations that this dvd portrays . most of the parents with children will enjoy . recommend for friends with grown children .
this dvd is very good and educational in a christian view . i am glad i purchased it so my niece has good cartoon to watch when she comes to visit me .
impossible years is a good old movie from the sixties . it 's dated and the dialogue is fairly contrived , but it has some pretty relative humor on the never ending battle with teenagers !
watched it upon receiving it and not too excited about watching it again . probably should give it another try . not bad , just nothing special .
we have enjoyed watching this series and look forward to the last season which we have already received and will start watching soon . anyone who enjoys action and drama will completely enjoy this series
i had no clue about the back story for this movie , not a boxing fan at all , but really enjoyed the movie . great acting . christian bale is superb !
slap stick british humor . so silly it is funny . if you enjoy this type of humor this is the movie for you .

always interesting . like the stories . like the characters . nice to watch them again . fun to watch and remember from childhood .

this was delivered as promised and replaced quickly when the first one arrived damaged . replacement arrived quickly . i would do business with them again .
this is a look into a different kind of lifestyle and how two people are meant to be together . the other side of this is that these two guys are brothers and that 's just weird .
one of mark wahlberg 's and the rock 's better movies . the story line was excellent , ( based on a true story ) , and all of the other character 's were well played .
it would have been a good movie if it was free on prime but not worth paying for . kevin hart is funny though
love selleck , and this was not a disappointment . did n't know it was out , even though it 's one of his older ones . am glad to have it .
just plain weird . i can not say much else except a very strange premise . the description i guess doesnt want to give away the movie .
saw this movie on tv and liked it better then the other harry potter movies and i and to have it and to me it 's worth buying .
i loved everything about this movie . it has a good message and the story line is a winner . you wo n't be disapointed if you buy this dvd . a decent film for the entire family .

it 's still good , but not like the original movie rose red ... but it gives you an insight of the first movie ...
i 'm a big fan of lost and i watched every episode when it aired live throughout its 6 seasons . i do think that the 1st and 2nd seasons were the very best .

what is there to say except this series is one of the best every made for families to watch . it is full of fun and good values .
i thought this would be like any other alien vs human fight for the world , in which it is basically but the way the story line plays out keeps me entertained . nicely done .
i bought this movie because i thought i already had a copy but could n't find it . it is a very good film .
actually , this one was for me . it was recommended to me by my daughter . i did n't think i would , but i liked it . it was cute ! !
i love the simpsons 2nd season ! this season is the season that turned tv around .
this was a pathetic excuse to make a western cartoon ! ! ? ? ? the story line was completely unbelievable . oh well , you win some and you lose some .
good acting that could not overcome a very average predictable script . this is an adequate filler on a bad tv night . otherwise , i would pass .
love the action and chuck norris . i 'd really miss his walker texas ranger , but i have them all on dvd
love elmo and i love the dancing segment in particular . my grandaughter has been watching this alot since long before she was two and loving it . we always watch together
i think this is a true story , if not , then it 's very plausible ! replacing my vhs with a dvd for my collection .
i had seen this movie before but forgot the story . richard gere makes a good bad guy . not the best spy thriller ever made , but it has some exciting twists and turns .
this movie will stay in my collection for years ! ! what a great old horror flick ! !
everyone loves this film , it is hilarious and well written and just fun . even kids love it , safe for all ages .

i received this movie a few days ago , and my grandaughter loves it . well worth the price ! i would recommend this movie for children , especially on having kids over on a saturday or sleep over .
classic disney masterpiece , great blu-ray digital transfer , fun extras . i was thrilled to see this movie as a kid , and it only seems to get better with age .
it 's so hard to believe that it 's funny . i do n't think it was meant to be serious . what a spoof !
love the actors , loved the story line . definitely a chick flick but a guy could possibly enjoy it too . i would watch it again .
i bought this for my sons birthday and he has watched it over and over . he loves it . it has all his favorite songs on it .
my title say it all ! you 'll roll on the floor every time you watch ! if you 're in or on your way to college , this movie is a must have ( along with animal house )
my husband loves these movies . the only one we do n't have is the very last one . well have to look for that one .
denzel washington is always good . he 's such a great actor and good human being . it was a gift for my husband and he thoroughly enjoyed it .
i liked the movie , but it was a little scary that this could possibly happen . the characters in the movie were excellent
have loved this movie since the first time i saw it many years ago . it is so wonderful to now have it in my collection !
so glad i was able to buy it and so quickly . this is a classic for anyone that has n't seen it . acting , music all awesome . steve martin steals the show .
what more can i say this is an absolute classic and i am glad to finally have this on blu-ray
i chose this rating because i love this show . so it was great that i could get them on here
part three was the only real disappointment in the series ; not a terrible film just did n't meet the standards of the first two .
i think this is one of tom hanks best , he never loses character ; even as an adult . this move had added things that were cut from the theater version ; which makes it much better .
just when you think there can be no more story , it twists and turns again . this series is even more intense then the first three .
we had purchased the first two seasons before we saw this set . this complete set was a much better deal and we have had hours of laughs .
i am pleased to have found a reasonably priced set of this show that i have just started to watch to allow me to catch up with the series at my own pace .
needed season six to complete my collection . great series , wish they would have continued it ! ! dvd 's were in very good condition when they arrived .
i really enjoyed this series and was not disappointed at all in season 1. ca n't wait to get season 2 because they do n't make series like this anymore , plain & simple .
good condition love this movie funny entertaining fun to watch alone or with a group with pop corn . i would recommend this to you
the storyline & acting were a bit hokey but , all in all , i liked the movie . it was entertaining & the giants were my favorite characters
i think the movie was plain fun and nothing less than just great . it was just as good as the first movie .
the dvd was delivered as always in perfect time ! love this horror movie . the best actors luke and kate , and the hotel was really scary !
i could only watch about half the film . i did not care for it at all . my son enjoyed it and had recommended so others may like it .
this is a charming , heartwarming and funny christmas movie which is a must for anyone who loves having a christmas movie collection .
i liked the writing and the plot with lots of twists and turns . this is a very good series to watch
very entertaining . i would recommend to anyone who enjoys english period movies . this is truly a classic movie with wonderful costumes .
like it at all . story line goes all over . did n't understand it . the story line that is ! . price too high !
i love it and i ca n't wait for my son to get old enough , so that i can force him to love it too .
a very good film i recommend to see good love story good ending . i did n't recognize the songs they were good .
season 7 was good , and the story line was more believable and the writing more upbeat . it is terrible that will only be one more season left .
been a long time since i watched this movie . was funny then and is funny now . enjoyed it very much
this season just pulled me in and would n't let me go . went to bed worried about the characters ! really complex characters and familiar relationships in our lives .
this was good if you are looking for the documentary part of the movie . but i didnt keep it . it was a one time watch and i gave it away .
murder she wrote is still a very enjoyable show to watch with interesting plots , good acting and some very familiar faces you will be glad to see .
it is a dvd it was for a gift dont know any thing about it i just need five words
i purchased this album for my sister , a major fan . i was not even aware it was an entire series !
a good storyline that fits around the original . would recommend to all oz fans , young or old . acting could have been better ( oz )
these episodes are so much fun . we will want to watch them over and over . love the acting by these two main girls . they are wonderful .
the 7 book series is phenomenal and the movies do an excellent job of following them . i highly recommend both .
i did love tinkerbell , one of my all time favorite disney characters & amp ; the music was great . a few things could have been changed , but not much .
a must add to any family movie collection me and my kids enjoy watching this one over and over again
i watched this movie not once , but twice , it was so good , i highly recommend it , on my scale , i give it a two thumbs up
a great movie with a wonderful cast ! ! and a good story ! ! the whole movie is a classic story that will live on ! !
i have watched several of these some on youtube and a couple with my kindle , they are good british humor , but you have to like the brits .
what a treat to watch these shows during the holiday season or whenever you need a little lift during the year highly recommend !
purchased this because my grandson loves mickey mouse and i wanted to have something for him to watch when i have him .
the action is this movie is superb . the huge intelligent aliens the soldiers deal with really put fear in the hearts of all involved . great movie ! ! !
i 've seen this on tv and it is quite different from all the other bible scenes , perhaps more accurate and interesting
i had no problems receiving it or looking at it . the movie took me back to when i was a child
the dog that every one loves . you will remember how they got the dog . one family movie truly wonderful the dog that is the boss of the family .
everything 's great about the movie . you do n't get tired of watching it over and over again . it 's what america should be all about !
a good movie with nice twists . nothing spectacular , but overall it was n't a complete waste of time . i probably would n't watch it again though .
i love sci-fi movies besides martial arts and marvel turned movies . this one did n't disappoint ... story may have been lame but the special effects definitely worth it .
the beginning was boring but it gets better as it gets going . whoever played the old crazy lady was very good .
definitely better the second time around . this is one of those movies where sometimes you just do n't get it on the first watching .
her leading man is a talent too but if you love eye candy you must have this simply to see how beautiful audrey is !
as an owner of volumes 1 , 2 , and 3 , i will tell you that i love them all and they are so much fun .
i saw this movie as a kid so when i saw it had to get it for my kids it a great family movie great price and it came fast love amazon
these is also a great movie , my whole family likes the beach party movies
this is a good foreign film . i liked it quite a bit . why do they make up leave a minimum number of words ?
a real change from the popular walt disney version . the grandchildren like it , even the grandsons do n't think it is too bad .
my mother actually bought it and i have n't yet actually watched it right through . she finds it a very good movie .
i actually got this item to replace a dvd i had loaned out and was never returned . both are great stories .
love the show . this is fun to see them interact and enjoy the relationships with each other and the characters .
we have enjoyed watching grace card and after several times watching it we still enjoy the movie . thank you ! we will be ordering again .
this is the top chick flick in my collection - incredible cast and well acted ... great score .
the movie is ok. personally i would take all violence out of children 's movies , now i have to teach the grandson as he watches all of them .
thank you - almost brand new ! the story was wonderful and what you sold was not damaged . we will look to you in the future to purchase from you .
the movie arrived on time and in perfect condition . this 1950 classic is joan crawford at her best . i do n't think joan was acting in this film ; just being her true self .
the continuation of the story is good . the characters interact better than before . the story line of a predictable vampire story is ok .
well , not as good as i 'd hoped it would be . some very colorful language and a few laughs - but not nearly enough to take it to the next level .
i will be returning this item - the disc skips on every cd player or computer i 've tried it on . unwatchable .
will smith always delivers as an actor and i love the sci-fi action . i loved the books in this series and would recommed them to people who like the movie .
this is an easy movie to watch with a great cast and excellent scenery . it will make you laugh and think twice before you try to run your parents life .
what can i say , it 's supernatural and you are either a fan or you or not . going with that said ; we enjoyed season 8 and we both are looking forward to season 9 .
my niece and cousin love this movie so much that love to watch again and who would watch this movie again it is awesome to watch .
this movie is excellent . the acting , the storyline everything the rock did , was awesome in this movie . the story is mildly gripping , and the action is fresh and entertaining .
a nice conclusion the the bourne series . could have used a little more imagination on the ending .
great classic and happy to finally have this film in my collection . one of my favorite movies that i will enjoy for yrs to come .
i like this version as much as the usa based show . the characters and stories really let you see how british legal system works .
i love vin diesel , especially in action movies . pitch black was his first action movie . he is a good actor , and i enjoyed these movies .
i 'm really happy with this purchase . it works perfectly , thank you ! it does n't skip , and the case is in good condition . no problems whatsoever .
two of the all time great actors along with a great supporting cast ! a great story well told with great acting !
i thought the story was well told . acting was excellent . technical production was very well done . overall very entertaining , may be a bit too violent for 10 and under .
the grandchildren as well as the adults all enjoyed this movie.the 3d quality was exactly as expected ... .great ! thank you
this film was really well done but it is very dated . you will need to be an old & # 34 ; film buff & # 34 ; to really enjoy it .
this is a great sequel so she had the baby she was n't in this film , pity ! it 's a very sensitive heartbreaking thrilling horror
a favorite at our house ! good price , fun for the whole family , made a great present ! debbie reynolds and gene kelly ! just makes you feel happy !
so much has been written about this and other versions that i would only be adding to the noise . excellent performances .
this is a good item , enjoyed it very much , was a bit scary , the way i like . i passed it on to a friend .
this is one of my favorite movies . i watched this while taking a train ride to st. louis . i have seen it many times but always find things new in the video .
great series , great writing , some of the best casting i have seen in a series . the pieces fit together so well , and subject matter is always worthy ...
this is a very good movie . it is one of those movies you can watch over and over . would recommend
a very worthy middle movie in a trilogy . i 'm excited to see the final installment . by the way , look quick or you 'll miss the walk on by peter jackson !
great movie i thought , had to own it 's been years since i 've seen this one . a must see you wont regret
wonderfully complex characters . well developed . surprising plot twists . realistic characters beautifully acted . another british masterpiece . i loved it . great series .
i only watched a few minutes with my girlfriend and it just seemed so dumb we just could watch much more of it .
enjoyed watching this again . james bond at it again ! never get tired of watching these even thought the technology used in the day they were shot is not what it is today .
this is not up to denzel best , there were to many bad actors in this movie with him . i was glad i did n't pay full movie prices
good humor but fairly disappointing for the actors involved . i say it is worth watching , but do n't bother moving it to the top of your watch list .
i loved this show but never got to see it from the beginning . i will continue to watch the episodes until i seen them all .
it is an older dvd , but it is a good murder mystery , it also has some light laughs throughout the movie .
for those expecting something like the original movie , you may be disappointed . however , if you like a modern movie on a classic theme then i highly recommend this one .
great actress , a real natural ! it 's always a pleasure watching these old shows . we need to bring back shows like this one !
it was okay , but did n't hold your interest very much . a lot of cheesy lines and at times looked fake . i would n't watch it again .
an old classic movie i have n't seen in a long time . my sister wanted to order it . action packed movie
amazing ! easy to follow , fast paced documentary . i am considering buying a copy as christmas gifts for family and friends !
great movie . my 8 year old and 3 year old girls love this movie .
this is one of the best shows . i loved it . need to see ! ! ! ! ! it was new and scenery and lots of stars
there were some funny parts but mostly not . i guess my husband and i expected it to be much funnier .
did not view all the way . not much of a story to follow , but lots of action . if you just want action go for it .
great movie . i am not a sports fan per say but this was such human and inspirational story that i really enjoyed it
i have been watching these since they aired on cbs when i was a kid . great cartoons for the garfield fans young and old .
really a surprise - enjoyed the story ( its a well told story but i like the new twist on this one ) different and very enjoyable .
this season is definetly not as good as season 1 or 2 but its still funny watching these girls be outrageous
my husband loves this show . the purchase of the dvds made him very happy . that made the purchase worth it .
there is quite a bit of mystery in this movie . it 's a pretty good film to watch .
my husband and i love mysteries , and the british ones are very good . i have other series and hope to view all of the midsomer murders .
my wife says it is a a great movie . we have different taste in movies so she has her movies and i have mine .
saw this at the movie theatre and loved it . wanted it for my movie viewing . ca n't wait to see it again .
i had it in my library of movies for years but it walked out the door and never came back . just had to have it for the grandchildren and me .
for some strange reason , this one has always been my favorite in the series . particularly from the forest scene onto the end . as a child , it had really stuck in my mind .
it is my favorite love movie , well acted and very funny . if you like love stories with humour you will like this .
this is one of the better vampire movies . most of the newer ones are pretty lame , but , lost boys is pretty good
if you like tcm you will like this film , good effects , creepy story and superb acting . get this now .
we have all 21 of the original seasons and have watched them from beginning to end a few times . i ca n't imagine anyone not enjoying this series .
amazon once again delivers . nothing to bring back childhood memories . i will recommend this to anyone who loves a classic cartoon .
great show , great quality dvds . recommend for everyone . it 's a great series with good values being taught . enjoy , enjoy , enjoy !
good story line & actors . the beginning was a lot to follow but the movie had a good story line .
loved this movie before i got it in 3d ! the home version is almost as great as the wide screen .
this is good old movie . not by todays acting standards but for its time it is funny and well made
i have fallen in love with all of these characters . i have discovered that the bbc is very very good at producing excellent series . i am very sorry that this one is at an end .
this blu ray transfer was well done and brought out details that i had missed before . it is a famous movie so i can add little there but the blu ray version was worth my money .
love the series and the quality and shipping of the item were great . still watch this video from time to time . nice to have this to watch when nothing appropriate is on television .
loved watching this series ; some of today 's shows do n't seem to me to be as good as jag because current viewings offered just do n't hold my interest
this is a very good movie for christmas time showing the spirit of giving even from a criminal . very touching movie .
our whole family enjoyed watching this movie , especially my 6 year old . very entertaining and fun , with some adult humor thrown in .
i gave this as a gift to the same person who received the 4th season and she was thrilled ( she now has 4 seasons ) .
def . worth adding to blu ray collection just for the vibrant colors . plot of this movie was okay , just as anyone would expect of course .
keep your expectations low and simply enjoy the comedy and atmosphere . this is pure entertainment not art ! ! ! great halloween fun for the entire family and the kids will learn some new words for the sat !
was well acted , michael j. fox is a funny guy and the show was something the whole family could watch .
great service . purchased this for my daughter who loved this movie when it was first released . gave it to her for christmas .
not what i expected , but diane keaton can pull anything off . i felt her pain over losing her son . all in all , it was good .
this is a good story with a good cast . i enjoyed it very much ! i would recommend this movie to a friend .
many stars that i love starring in this movie . it was funny and touching and just good plain entertainment . i would recommend it to friends .
it is a great story , great actors playing their part to perfection , great sound track , therefore making it one of my favorite movies . i highly recommend it to everyone .
this collection of the final episodes of not only of season 2 and the also the final episodes of the series ! good , worth a watch !
the dvd got here ok. it may be months before i have a chance to review it . since i love shakespeare , i 'm sure it will be grand .
it 's a chance to go back and live life for others instead of for yourself , and learn new lessons too
i 've seen this twice , and it will be one to watch again ; it has good acting , good story , excellent cgi - a thoroughly entertaining movie .
wish there are barbie a mermaid tale 3 ! please do make mermaid there ? ok ? it pretty good than the first one
very satisfied with the product and with the speed of delivery . all was in very good order .
it 's not as advertised . poorly directed , bad acting and really quite boring , i was not pleased with it .
we love this movie and cant wait for the 3rd one in the series . this a move that we can watch over and over .
was in good shape glad i bought it . is a real good love story . will buy more dvd . have used it twice and going to watch it again soon .
great cartoon . brings me back to when i was a little kid watching the marvel action hour with iron man and the fantastic four . a must have for marvel fans .
cool little movie . good for young & old . lots of singing so if you do n't like musicals , this is n't for you .
its not bad but it not anything special either not really something to pay to watch its really not that good
one of stephen king 's better movies . this one is worth a watch . did n't care for all the sequels that came afterwards . i can live without them .
richard is the king of comedy , his movies are classics and will live on forever in our hearts , i 'm glad i got the opportunity to grow up in the 70 's ...
i love this movie . despite some people 's reviews i really enjoyed it . looks great in 3d as well ! i love the wicked witch ! !
i have watched this movie many times . i really like the people chosen for their parts . the premise is interesting and well written . i can recommend this film . thank you amazon
it 's part of the lord of the rings . i am kinda biased because i love this franchise so much . would definitely pay to see it again .
this was a good way to spend a rainy afternoon . sometimes the plot was a little slow going but then it picks up speed and you will not be disappointed .
it was fun watching this with my daughter for the first time . she realized where a number of cultural references that she grew up with came from .
seeing this movie will make you think twice about kids lol . not much to say about it . check it out . what 's the worst that can happen you spend time with people lol
this movie is one of my faves . i ca n't help but watch it everytime i notice it 's on tv . it was better than most 80s movie but not as good as the lost boys .
i 'm so glad that i bought this set . i waited for it to come out . she is so funny . i put on one of her dvd 's whenever i need a laugh .
of course i saw this long ago but forgot what a lovely movie it is . even men like this one .
this is a fun , interesting movie , i liked the story and the cast very much . sooner than netflix is great .
one of my all time favorite movies so i added it to my small collection to watch over and over

these guys are awesome as actors ! ! ! great t.v . series ! ! ! i got the 2nd one too ! ! ! just as great as the 1st one ! ! !
rent this or get it online free the production values of this are poor . dr strange ( who i didnt follow ) was superior .
always enjoyed this movie and i 'm glad it was released on blu-ray and offered at a good price . a lot of suspence and a classic !
love the singing and the dancing in the movie . surprised me that burt reynolds is n't that bad of a singer .
i love all the james bond 007 movies . in fact i have all 24 on blu-ray disc . this is one of my favorites with roger .
the rest were good but she is my love -- -- always . will you see her best film ? same time next year ?

one of the great ones they do n't carry in stores . wonder what stores are for anymore . great favorite with great actors .
i liked this movie . it had a good story and a good ending . it 's an older kind of movie , but , i still enjoyed it .
enjoyed remembering the characters and laughing at their antics . the theme song is one that is hard to get out of your head . good for a few laughs .
this show will make you laugh and then make you cry . very well acted and written . now one of my favorite shows .
this is my favorite in the series . awesome movie for the entire family . good times . this has awesome adult humor so us adults are bored .
and this movie proves why . dicaprio is great in the film and loved the accent that he put on . got ta get this one

it was a funny show you have to see over and over ! what more can i say man its real ?
wow to find the jag series was wonderful . i loved the show when it ran , and now i can watch them when ever i want .
excellent storyline and characters are flawless . keeps you on the edge of your seat through entire story . sorry , it was the last one .
saw this on the hallmark channel . did n't know anything about this movie and really enjoyed it . it was a very emotional story , but very well done and had to buy it for my hallmark collection .
love it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! hopefully i 'll be able to find more money to buy other seasons . keep a good thought for me .
it arrived quick . quality was great . i like horror movies and this was enjoyable . i would recommend any vintage horror movie fan to watch it . this is right on line with the 70 's version .
great movie and great cast . tom hanks and sandra bullock were excellent and the young man who played their son was outstanding .
excellent show starts a little slow but get real good quickly to bad it was canceled and not picked up by someone else . i recomend this to other scifi fans .
i was not that impressed but my husband seemed to enjoy it a lot . probably will not buy the dvd but will watch it on the tv when it comes out
everyone will find something hilarious about this stand up routine . just buy it .
this is such a gem ! doris day is an absolute treasure to watch , this movie is funny all the way ! you will love it if u like oldies that are funny n interesting !
very nice movie . simple to follow and very touching . a unique way of learning about friendships and what we are capable of doing .
if you like this tv show as i do then get this item there is stuff on here that you will never see on tv
i had forgotten about this series until i saw it on amazon prime . the writing is smart and unexpected -- the acting is excellent !
great classic comedy that is a must see around halloween . very funny and a great cast of stars . a great mix of comedy and horror .
short stories that keep you going for more . not real scary but still good . kind of like the show amazing stories .
is a very simple movie , romantic , sometimes funny , and nothing extraordinary happens but has his charm . because sometimes in our lives we have the same silly things . i like it .
this was a christmas gift for my daughter in law and she watched it right away and she absolutely loved it .
a cary grant movie my husband enjoyed and wanted for his collection . a great addition to his collection of movies .
surprisingly good movie that my entire family enjoyed , all the way down to our 8 year old daughter . it definitely was n't anything original but it filled saturday night movie night very well .
this is really one of the best comedy tv shows ever , i hope that all seasons to be released .
my son who has read the novels was not impressed with the movie version ... so thumbs down from a 9 year old who read the books . stick with the books .
sidney poitier i am a fan of his early films . i also have & # 34 ; in the heat of the night & # 34 ; a moive that should move you heart .
had a good trip down memory lane ! i 'm a big who fan and this was a good dvd to watch .
great movie . i love all the iron man movies and # 2 is a great follow-up to the first movie . highly recommend it !
i could n't wait to order this movie ! i love tyler perry 's work so i was excited to buy this move . it 's hilarious .
i do n't know anyone who does not love the muppets ! this movie takes me back . the muppets were one of the best things that have ever came to be .
i just started watching the show and so far it is really good . the episodes are really short so be ready for that .
i bought these for my husband for christmas ... he loves them ! one of his favorite sci-fi shows , it was fun watching them again .
excellent movie based on a true story . tom hanks was awesome in his role ! great entertainment ! i recommend it for everybody to watch if they have n't , i watched it twice !
the quality of the blu-ray transfer is very good . this movie is an excellent detective story and also provides an interesting glimpse of just how difficult life was in europe during the middle ages .
nice romantic comedy i had watched it before so it was kind of cool to watch it again ... really enjoy it !
you can never miss with tom hanks , and this movie follows suit . dvd was in perfect shape and shipped promptly . thanks : )
we rented this for $ 1 before thinking about buying it . the tv show is better . suggest you rent it . we will not be buying this dvd .
i think this version is better than the newer one that came out a couple of years ago . brings back great memories of hanging out with my dad and watching john wayne movies . loved it !
i was looking for a friday night thriller and after watching the trailer , i was sold ! this was so much fun ! loved it !
this movie is a special kind of christmas , one that everyone needs to see about how we touch each others lives
this was actually a gift for my father . he absolutely loved this as a christmas present ! it was something he grew up on .
brilliant ! one of the best of this type of film from the golden era . it is a treasure for any collector .
yep , now this is a good movie . i recommend it to anyone who is interested in watching this one , for sure !
the kids were not as interested as they were with the super mario brothers super shows . they love super mario but this was not liked as well .
i remember watching this show when i was a kid & it was good then & it is still good today .
i love midsomer murders and have watched all the sets , and look forward to the new ones now . highly recommended
this play had me and my hubby rolling around , laughing till we could not laugh anymore . if you like a good play , with laughs and christian themes , this is for you .
this is a wonderful movie . i got one for me and my 18 year old grandson , he loves the movie .
had seen the first movie , and thought i would enjoy the others in the set . i have to say that i was disappointed , and ended up selling this to someone else .
great show i love it one of the best hbo shows of all time a great conclusion to a great show
this dvd has a lot of hard to find 70 's movies rolled into one . it is definitely worth the money .
after watching several different productions on dvd at our opera club i have purchase a 3 of dvd 's of different productions of this opera , i like this one the best .
i bought this movie because i already own part one and so naturally part two completes my collection . it was exactly as described . great condition and delivered on time . i am totally satisfied
if you liked the dvd & # 34 ; big changes & # 34 ; , you 'll love this one too . a continuation of big changes , it 's just as enjoyable as the first .
i loved the shows in these seasons . i have now all seasons and ca n't wait to see when the next seasons come out
my daughter loves this movie ( just like every little girl i imagine ) and sings the songs all the time . the show has a great story and is n't too annoying to watch as a parent .
liked the series when it was first on tv and enjoy watching these again . simon baker does a great job of playing a likeable bad boy trying to be good .
i was hoping for a little more substance to this movie . dancing was good though .
this would be an awesome movie if it was n't for that . i 'm glad i watched it first without my kids !
watched this video when i was a kid and wanted a copy for myself . still a good show for the kids to watch .
if you are looking at this , you know it is good . i dont have to tell you that you should buy them all . seriously
i love even watching them on tv but to have them and be able to watch them anytime i want is the best
a very good movie about a wonderful singer . another movie that i can watch over and over and not get tired of it .
i have always wanted to see this . i know it 's an old movie but i 'm going to enjoy watching it .
i have not laughed so hard since the original hangover . this comedy is in a class of its own . leo is unbelievably hilarious ! highly recommended !
i bought this dvd mostly for the inner light , but all of the episodes are great . this is a great deal for any star trek fan !
have always liked how burt reynolds always had the same people in his movies . this is certainly not high cinema , but it was fun back then , and still kind of funny .
this is a very good movie . it was very exciting and kept me interested through the very end .
great action , great cast . ca n't wait for the next one . the end of this one leaves another sequel guaranteed . i hate it when they do that !
this show is intriguing and keeps you entertained . there is a great story line and it will keep you at the edge of your seat .
this is one of my grandson 's favorite movies . the story is cute . the music is awesome . this is good family entertainment because us older folks loved it as much as the kids .
i remember watching this growing up . it is a bit cheesy but good 80 's fun , and you ca n't beat that .
i very much enjoyed this movie . i liked this better than some of the other batman movies . i would recommend this over some of the other movies .
good for all ages . the characters are good to look at and believable . i like the story a lot . awesome
this is one of the best series bbc has produced and i 've seen most of them . the acting is superb and the writing and story line is wonderful .
i 'm getting this for a friend whom truly loves batman . he will really enjoy that i 've gotten him all of the batman movies ever made now , thanks to amazon ! ! !
never knew this was on the air got the dvd and i must say very good both guys rod hot
no more needs to be said . and the audio sounds great to me .
i love this movie ! this is for sure one you should put in your collection ! very good transaction , so no need to put off the purchase !
i 've seen this movie on the on demand free movies and i loved this movie when i watched it on tv for free . i 'm glad that i have this on dvd to own .
i 've watched this one a few times now and still laugh at it . who can resist betty white ? ! that being said , if you can resist her , pass on this movie
always a outstanding nicholas sparks read really like his books and movies they stay close to the book . great outstanding ! ! ! !
great story . awesome acting . fabulous scenes . cool movie . clint has done a lot of impressive films over his accomplished career - this is my favorite ! ! !
criminal minds : the sixth season is really a thinking persons show it has plots to keep you guessing and the ability to make you care about the cast . it is well worth watching many times .
this movie is good even if you have not read the book you will know what is happening all the way through .
what took them so long ! if you enjoyed the andy griffith show in the 60s you do n't need a long boring description . just buy it !
this show has great acting and fantastic characters ! its a great show from start to finish ! if you like comedy and syfy you will like it .
a good movie for a sunday afternoon . it was entertaining , and andrew mccarthy is always a good performer to watch .
one of the worst movies i 've ever seen . yes , it had a few parts that were disgusting but for the most part it was just slow and really stupid .
one of the following movies to the series , only buy this if you watched and liked the anime series . i reviewed the anime series .
this ai n't your normal sci-fi just trying to make it work with blood , guts , horror and special effects . nice plot twists will make you think .
my mom and i wanted this , thought it was a good movie . it was a good movie night . had a little bit of everything . the story is something that everyone can relate too .
i enjoyed watching this movie along with my two granddaughters . i highly recommend this for the girls . it is good to add to the barbie collection .
great movie , first chance i 've had to replace an old vhs copy i 've had for years . not only a classic movie , but a great cast . all these great actors are now gone .
i am a fan of british tv . this was excellent . great actors , story and excellent setting . looking forward to watching the whole series .
i missed it so much i had to buy it . i could n't resist . it 's just a fun show to watch . the families and the friendship make it a great find .
i saw this when it was in theaters and just saw it again with my daughter . it 's still a fun movie .
one of the best mini series i 've ever watched ! it is fantastic that there are people in hollywood that still remain true to their faith .
still one of my favorites after all these years . well-written dialog and plenty of action makes fun for the whole family . a must-have for any true transformers fan .
i enjoy watching this series from time to time and i still enjoy it . the quality is great and not disappointing .
the last movie in the series that both my husband and i love . i wanted it so we can watch them whenever we want and commercial free .
love that they have been releasing the 70s and 80s shows . i 'm not a television watcher now , too much sex , violence , and language . love the chemistry between lee and amanda .
i love this movie . it 's a classic . i 'm glad i was able to purchase it on instant video . movie night !
i enjoyed the premise of this movie and looked forward to watching it . it seemed to fall apart and i did n't like anything after the 25 minute mark .
i really like this show , but the first season was not a funny as i remembered . i 'm sure it will get better as the characters develop . i 'm excited for the next few seasons .
this is a great classic film that i have seem many times over the years and it is always a good one to go back to . even my grandson liked it .
i liked this movie better than the first movie judge dredd played by sylvester stallone but then i like karl urban .
arrived on time and was new as promised . great price . great dvd of john wayne , are n't they all ? great price .
not sure why this was such a dud in the theater . it could certainly have been better , but it was a reasonably enjoyable movie .
one of the burns ' brothers best - amazing amount of research and information but time goes by so fast its presented in such an interesting way . great educational tool .
i 've always loved this movie ... and even more now that my daughter is old enough to watch this and enjoy it with the wife and me .
nothing imaginative here . really no good acting . certainly no good writing . an action film without much compelling action . i would n't recommend it .
the movie was okay . it had action , some suspense and even though it was based on actual events , i would n't rent it again .
this has always been one of my all time favorite series . a must have for , let 's say , the older set . lol
zany and funny , well written and well acted . a bit silly and over the top but highly entertaining . a great date movie .
so much more to this story than expected . for the young at heart who grew up on mary poppins . emma thompson is wonderful .
i first only saw the first episode and knew that i had to own it . this is a great anime .
this film is a definite winner , with an outstanding beginning , middle and end . the film is action packed and well acted , as well as produced .
love paul hogan in this series good fun and great continuing plot a a a a a a a a

a good arnold bloody , action packed movie ! ! pretty good for an aging actor ! ! good story line !
a great segal movie where he takes care of a problem that needs to be done .
what an amazing adventure , captured on film ! i had no idea that this footage existed - so glad we discovered it !
have not got to watch yet , but i should get to it in a few days really like superman , just wish i had his powers .
good actors , but plot will leave you with bad feeling . sad for our society . cruel killing , crazy people . very sad .
it is great having all 4 movies in one boxset and at a great price you ca n't go wrong with adding these awesome movies to your collection
it was ok , but i could tell you at the beginning what was going to happen . i like ones i ca n't figure out .
received the dvd have not viewed it yet but it appears to be new as promised . thank you
i really enjoyed this movie . it 's easy to see that it was filmed a while ago but it 's still good .
this was a different type of movie than i usually watch . it was ok. i do understand that it came from comics and that is why i watched it .
i liked it a lot to put it simple i can say more but i do n't want to waste time telling you i do n't regret buying it
i 'll watch anything he appears in , and i saw this movie years ago . goldie hawn was even less annoying than usual ; it holds up well .
another disney adventure movie . ca n't wait til my grandson it of age to watch this with me . i know he will enjoy it too .
awesome special effects for a mostly done on blue screen movie , lots of extras , great addition to battlestar galactica series .
if you are looking for sex ... ... forget it ! however if you want to watch a good movie that is serious and somewhat reflects history ... this is it !
i used to watch this movie on lifetime every time it came on so i was so excited that they had it available to buy .
this is a great family movie . you can sit down with your children for a night of family get together and popcorn and have a good clean time .
great animated series for the whole family and a definite classic for all time . if you do n't like the movie , you will love this , for it is somewhat opposite of it !
i love bleach . i own all bleach up to box set 6 and hope to get more . i share them with friends .
i watched the first season and had to see the second season . it definitely has a twisted and great plot line .
got here in good time and looked to be in good shape . can ; t wait to watch it again . such a good movie . you should give this one a try !
my son loves this movie and so did my mother in law they are both big baseball fans and really enjoyed it
this was a great miniseries addition to the spartacus series . while the spartacus character was not seen , it really gave back story to the characters that made him what he became in later seasons . great series !
wished we had good clean movies like this still . enjoyed so much , good family entertainment . would highly reccomend for anyone
worth watching but not really that scary for me . others may be scared by this movie but it was more like a scary documentary
got this to go along with the original movie . we are happy with all three of the cinderella movies made .
ive been wanting this movie for over twenty five years . i saw this movie when i was a teenager . im so happy to finally have it .
the story is pure fantasy . the music is great . the costuming and set design are over the top beautiful . do not know why it did not win an oscar .
this was a heart warming and hilarious movie . the entire family truly enjoyed watching this again and again . thank you !
this is one of my favorite clint eastwood movies , and the second one called any which way you can came with it . with clint eastwood you ca n't go wrong .
i first saw this movie years ago and thought about it the other day . was very excited to see that amazon had a copy , and it came very quickly and in great shape .
my husband and i saw this movie several years ago and loved it from the start . was a for sure must have to our christmas movie collection .
this was such a pleasure to watch again . i would recommend anyone that has not seen this show before , buy it ! you will love it !
this is one of the best movies of all times . every year or so , i get this feeling that forces me to look up the movie and enjoy it once again ... addicted ! ! : )
this era has always intrigued me and this series and the characters within , portray it very well . looking forward to more episodes .
i enjoy watching this movie with the twists and turns . it ended with happy ending and kept me on the edge of my seat thinking and wondering .
just an easy watch before i go to bed . the show is a classic and fun . this one is not as exciting as the previous seasons .
my sister loves this show and was happy when i got this for her . she has watched and loves it
the storytelling and speaking style is different from the previous seasons , some are different voice actors . it 's okay , but definitely different .
the expendables is a very good movie love the one liners very funny looking forward for part 3 all the stars for one movie brilliant idea stallone love both expendables
this movie sucked it was not even worth the money it did n't even make any sense i swear there has to be a part 1
character is too hard and too tough for too long . no one could hold a job with that attitude . too much profanity .
price was great and i received the package sooner than expected . i love this series , so ended up buying the dvd - still hoping it will come back on tv soon
i think the bluray looks good . anyone who thinks too much into this stuff needs a life . van damme is bad ass as usual and never gets enough credit .
probably my favorite all time 007 movie . i was really pleased to find this on prime for no extra charge . always fun , suspenseful and with a touch of bond humor .
hard to find a gay film these days that has any production values . this was well-acted , poignant , and visually satisfying . good film .
this is one of my favorites great singing great storyline all in all needs to be long and everybody 's library
it 's a documentary . really slow start and slow presentation . i could not finish watching it , if you like documentaries you might enjoy this .
i really like this movie . it is a great romance and mel gibson is one of my favorite actors . was surprised that my purchase arrived so quickly . can wait to watch this favorite again .
fun movie with a great cast . it 's a little slow getting going but worth it in the end . those guys have a lot to teach us all on how to enjoy and live life .
bringing all the avengers together into one movie was a masterful move . the special effects are awesome . thor and iron man play the best characters !
this was an awesome show my sons even liked it . watch it though make sure the dvds play on your dvd player before you do anything else .
got this dvd for the grandchildren when they come to visit . they just loved it and watched it several times .
another great movie good for kids to watch also michael keaton is great in this role cant say enough about it
would highly recommend this movie as it is a realistic truth about history and the powerful catholic church . not at all what i expected .
the 3 pink panther movies were a great deal ! they were funny movie . the movies came in good order and quickly .
i enjoy this moving ever time i watch it . its definitely a tear jerker , thats why i had to have the dvd
i loved this movie . it made me cry but the acting and the music were just great . it drew you into the story very quickly .
this was highly rated , but i was n't all that excited about it . it was average as far as acting and story line in my opinion .
i always loved the series , and now i own all four reasons . it is good tv watching for anyone who remembers tv before special effects took over .
i think that this is the best of the & # 34 ; twilight & # 34 ; movies . i loved all of the series but this was by far , the best .
another great addition to our midsomer collection . especially at an affordable price . we look forward to adding more sets as well ...
i love this movie but lost it to a fire , and i had to get it again . its a really good movie !
i am a big fan of this series . although i do have to add there were some episodes that i did n't like .
great family story ! highly recommend it . most of us can relate to some part of it , for sure . original as well .
great & classic movie ! what makes it even better , is that whitney houston is singing throughout the movie . miss that voice !
while this season is n't as good as 5 or 6 it 's hard to complain when even a bad doctor who episode ( for me ) is still better than most anything else on tv .
love it - quality excellent - great in the theater , great on dvd . books better , but that 's usually the case : - )
this was a great collection . all of the movies in this set were entertaining , moving , at times suspenseful , and definitely something the entire family could enjoy . that 's always nice .
it was great to see alot of the older actresses with there clothes off again .
this movie has one spot that skips other than that it 's great . kids love it . thanks a bunch for all .
to mark the 20th anniversary of this wonderful film . it has so many special & wonderful features that any fan will love .
if you love them on tv you 'll love them even more on dvd where you can watch any time you want .
very good ! i do n't know if i like the second season as much but the first season was pretty good .
could n't wait to have this movie . what a great ending to a great series ! delivery was prompt and was very pleased to receive it . love the potter movies !
interesting considering it 's based on true events . acting was n't great . i would say it 's worth watching even though the acting was n't very good .
i remember watching this film as a kid . it is nostalgic to me now . not the greatest of movies , but the younger generation likes it . my younger brother sure does .
intense and well done home invasion thriller . i loved the weird feel of this and the surprises kept me entertained . missed it in the theater but will watch it again soon .
i really am not into new tv shows , too much blood , too much core , too much ... i like this because it is fun .
enjoyed the joy . have n't seen it in a long time . love disney movies and this was no exception . it has nice characters and a good family show to watch .
the fact that i could only watch 30 minutes of it does n't count . ca n't believe they all sang live . nice set .
this movie is a classic . you do n't need me to tell you that . there are very few movies that i will watch twice . this i could watch twice a week and still laugh .
i already liked this movie and this dvd was in excellent shape and a pleasure to watch ... it is a great story if you do n't mind facts and you can accept facts as they are .
i am waiting to get this great movie on dvd , its about time it came out on dvd
lots of back ground of her life . not much focus on what she did and how it was received . i would not recommend . acting was very good however .
i think there should have been more episodes ... ... hopefully , more to the series will be produced . talent in series was very captivating .
a tense film of the cold war era that makes one almost feel as if you are there !
it is so good it needs no introduction . the plot line is just enough and the plot is excellent and engaging
it was ok but not as good as the first one . i may watch it again sometime but i 've watched the original a dozen times and will again .
i have seen this movie quite a few times . though it is a bit old it is still great for its time .
i think that this is his best special hes ever done and i bought this used and looked just as good as the new ones . s
great movie , good price deal , came in no time , good condition , awesome movie recommend anyone to who likes action and adventure in movies
it liked all the stories , they were interesting and different . i recommend series to any that likes horror stories and looking for something more than zombies .
comedy , action , romance , social commentary , blood , great actors and great performances . if you have n't seen this you are in for a treat .
loved it a long time back so i knew i would like it more now so i got it again
my granddaughter 's favorite princess and favorite movie . how could this not be a great purchase . really pleased with this movie
it was entertaining , but could have been better . too pg , if you know what i mean . needs more gore and and more excitement , it was just a bit slow .
loved this movie . if you love elvis movies then this is a must . it was a great movie but then i think all of elvis movies are great .
this movie was very interesting and exciting at the same time . lots of action and a little strange , but good .
peter falk was perfect for the role of columbo . he made you laugh , cry and always wonder what he was going to do or say next !
my brother told me this was a must see so i bought it and i loved every bit of it

i love liam neeson ! the unknown was one of his better movies . i really liked the part he played as well as the climax of this movie !
you ca n't not love smallville . if you are a fan of super heros , then you are going to love this show .
ok this move was a great movie , i am so glad i have it in my collection ! as i could not imagine it without it !
bought this without knowing anything about it . kids and i watched it and were surprised at how much action it had and it held our full attention for the full movie .
i should have bought this one instead of just renting it . i enjoyed it and so did the kids . maybe for the new year i will buy it .
this is a musical that i can sit down and watch over and over again . my 18 year old daughter was amazed that i knew all the words to all the songs .
per memories . one of the first movies i ever saw . beautiful hawaii .

excellent as a movie , then a vhs tape , then two different dvds , now a blu-ray . get it now , who fans !
i watched the trailer and was expecting more . it 's an okay popcorn movie but was n't as good as i 'd hoped it would be . the characters are pretty shallow and the ending is stupid

i love iron man he is so funny and powerful . i like hero movies and this is a good one .

ordered this for a friend an she loved it ! she just loves to watch this movie . although kinda hard to watch .
it may have been a lesson on & # 34 ; be careful on what you wish for & # 34 ; . i would n't watch it again , but do n't regret watching it .
this is also a wonderful film from the 1950 's . i enjoyed seeing these films then and definitely love seeing the films on dvd now .

i 'm going to give this to my daughter for christmas . we have these shows on vhs , but well be better on dvd ,
this movie was horrible ! ! it made no sense what so ever ! it was boring and it did nothing to hold my attention .
this man was so way ahead of his time . is life was to short but his music will be around forever ! worth any amount .
it was really great that we found 1 dvd that add all 3 movies in a set . really good deal .
this movie was not what my wife and i were expecting . it was better . well acted , well written , well shot . what more can i say ?
one of the best old movies from the 60 's entertaining . movie is a great adventure to watch . grab a bowl of popcorn a drink and sit down to watch something very entertaining .
great price for all the discs . the movie itself it bad to the bone , ca n't wait for 2 and 3 .
i thought the movie was funny ; kevin james always makes me laugh . if you 're a fan of kevin james , you 'll enjoy this movie .
this a great cast and none stop action , the two main characters are absolutely fantastic together and has a superb storyline . makes another great addition to western collection .
it was a good film but it moved slow in spots . the acting was well done and the plot was interesting
my 2 1/2 year old grand daughter just loves curious buddies and this one has not disappointed her . she loves it !
pretty predictable , but still entertaining . i liked this movie the best of the series , and had seen them all so had to finish with this one .
this product worked fine for me . nice movie that i enjoy watching more than once . shipped in good time and in good shape .
i mainly purchased it for our sons . i enjoyed the movie , but my boys loved it ! we highly recommend this movie .
i did n't particularly like or dislike this film ... truth be told it was on sale and i bought it to add to my collection of lifetime movies on dvd .
what a nice bonus to have 2 seasons in one . i enjoy watching this series as much as i enjoy shopping amazon .
it 's wayne 's world ... so you know it is funny . but i do n't think it is as funny as the first wayne 's world . but all and all i still enjoyed it .
even though i am a big transformers fan , because i use to have some of those toys since i was a kid .
you just might be surprised by the way it ends . from start to finish , this series was truly great .
this is a very good movie and a good product despite the lack of extended version . excellent special features .
where are the season 3 dvds ? why is it such an issue to get them released ?
the first season did n't really grab me , but the second season has me riveted . i love it ! i look forward to each episode .
this movie is action-packed with wonderful scenery . tom cruise does an excellent job of acting . i believe this film won an academy award .
very good i would watch it just because its star trek , but even through it was well done it is a bit like the first one !
i bought this cd to complete my bond movies , one of the best ! the bond movies already have a space for this movie
i ca n't believe it is 2013 and i 'm just now watching this movie ! where have i been ? this movie is worth the watch !
very good story line . i could really relate to the characters as i saw myself growing up . exceptional acting . i would watch it again .
was n't expecting much but was surprised how great this movie ended up being . it was action packed and a fun ride . i 'm definitely a fan of both of the main actors now !
it is amazing how this guy could turn everything into an fun journey in life . even when he is walking into his death , he tries to make it fun for the son . i am very impressed .
loved watching it over and over . cant wait for the next season to come out . this seller will always be on my list to use over and over .
i had no idea that this movie had so much scary stuff and scared me a little . just a little .
really enjoyed this series . ca n't wait for the next season on dvd . made a great gift for my daughter . thanks .
this is a great remake of the classic . i enjoyed it more than i thought i would . i love the graphics in this movie .
i thought the movies was good but a little to dark for my taste . it could have shown more of the street life they had to do
i have watched this sooo many times . it 's so sad & so great all at the same time . i got a second one for my granddaughter . she loves it as well .
great fan of meryl streep who is so versatile as an actor . glad there is a source at amazon to get great movies at a reasonable cost .
it reminded me of the harry potter series of movies . the first was the best movie and the last just completed the series .
really can you not like something johnny does . it is great nothing like the original . this is a fun movie not really for young children .
i had the cover and was glad you had just the dvd . the kids love this movie as well as myself !
not as great as the first one , but still well worth watching . the obvious talent in the cast is just great
ca n't wait for the next season ( 4 ) to be available ! ! ! characters are portrayed as if you are living in that time .
one of the first anime series i ever watched and got me hooked on all the rest , if you have not seen this series you dont know what you are missing ! !

i love this movie . until i found it on amazon.com , i never thought i would find it on dvd but when i did , i had to buy it

this movie kept my interest and was fun to watch . good actors too . i would recommend it to the action movie fan .
this is a classic movie , i saw it over 30 years ago and was so move by it i had to added into my movies collection

what would you do if the circumstances were the same with your daughter ? i found the movie very realistic , and it is one i would watch again and recommend to others .
great sexy and fun that makes fun of that other movies -- this bat is more sexy than the male model of the same -- also their joker not half bad
old classic movie for young children and young at heart adults , i remembered this movie when it first came out

enjoyed in theater . wanted to see again as you miss things first time around . usually buy movies i enjoy watching .
having seen all the mature inspector morse works and loving them i find this acting so juvenile . stories , as l , are good .

i love this movie i saw it in the theatre and could n't wait for it to come out on dvd i was surprised to see it on the free streaming videos .
very good dvd . again , this was the very same saturday serial that i saw at the movie theater when i was a kid .
but the story was pretty good . i thought the acting was done very well . i just wish it had more laughs in it .
i ordered and received the movie brand new . i had no problems playing the movie or anything . it 's an awesome movie and i would highly reccommend it to those who have not seen it .
another great christian bale performance . he was really psycho . i watched this movie and was impressed with his early acting . he 's an awesome actor . a must buy for fans .
i think this movie is n't bad at all , yeah it 's not a movie i want to watch all the time but i think it is a fine low budget zombie flick , check it out .
great dvd . has some classics on it . bought it for my 22 year old daughter , she loves it .
very entertaining with a different twist . not much of a mystery but i enjoyed the different characters and their situations
this is an exciting season because jim and pam get married and have their daughter ! the wedding is one of my favorite episodes , it 's so cute ! definitely one of the best seasons !
my 3 year old daughter requested this purchase , and has not stopped talking about it since she watched it the first time !

this is amazing ! ! ! : d so cute and the songs within the movie are so catchy that you 'll be singing along to them throughout .
i love this movie , but i have n't watched my dvd yet as my tv has died on me . i am sure i will still love it when i get to look at it .

what 's not to love , picture is great , story is a kaye classic , and remember , it 's yours you earned it ! .
i enjoyed this movie and would recommend to most audiences . good plot with some really hilarious times . jennifer was great as usual .
did n't deserve the effort . sadly horrible script , acting and filming . and what else can i say to make the point ?
used to watch this show in the 90s and now my teenager is watching this show . great family show . still makes me laugh . loved how the package has the design of the house .
this tv show makes you feel like you were there . i decided to go hunting with my son just as an excuse to shoot something !
high action movie and better than excellent computer graphics . the only thing keeping it from 5 stars is a little weak on the story line . overall pretty good though .
was entertaining but probably won ; t watch it again . would have been much better to have watched it by streaming it down on amazon rather than purchasing the bluray .
the box came damaged . not particularly happy . do n't want to pay the money to send it back just for the box . hopefully the dvd works
i like this when it first came out on tv and still like it even today . wish they would come out with a new series to continue the story line .
i love to be entertain and have action at the same time . love all the actors . keep it up , bruce and company !
this is a classic i love harvey and we were very pleased with everything thank you
the picture quality was something to be desired . the story line seemed familiar but had some creative genius in making an enjoyable movie.i ca n't say i loved it but it was very cute ! !
andy williams christmas special brings back many happy memories from my childhood . used to enjoy watching his t.v . specials .
was delivered as promised and we enjoyed watching this dvd . our previous one got damaged and it 's nice to know this one was a click away
i thought this was going to be a great movie but got so depressed with the first 1/2 hour or so that i turned it off .
season 5 was the best ever . i do n't know how they can make this even better ! i ca n't wait to see 5 b !
this program was one of the best ever created ! they are awesome characters . the only weird thing is that last episode ... who were those people anyway ? ? ?
movie was alot better than i had thought it would be . loved the way all the famous actor and actress played their part .
great movie ! have this on vhs , had to get it on dvd . must have for your scooby doo collection . enjoy !
what can i say ? just great movie . they do n't make them like this anymore . too bad !
i could n't wait to have this set seen it on tv now i get to watch it anytime i want . i it does n't long for my shipment to come very satisfied .
the real story of alice in wonderland the politically correct do not want you or your children to know about
i will add it to my library of dvds and it will be available if i choose to use it .
i 've watched this at least a dozen times and it never gets old . a tight thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat and has held up well over the years . a classic .
the best dracula of all times , hammer film was one of the best producer of horror films in the 70 's
this is my favorite series movie . i love it soooo much . it is a must watch . this one of the sad parts of the series
good acting and a storyline that continued throughout the first season made this a gripping series . plus a glimpse of ellen page before she made it big in hollywood .
this movie gives you more details about rose red . love anything and everything from stephen king . something to watch more than once .
excellent lawyer show balanced with excellent drama . the characters are fantastic and the storylines are often relevant to current events .
got what i asked for - a good classic that my little boy loves to watch : )
i have watched the 3 seasons and want more . love his character , determination and how good of a detective his is .
classic story and has become a tradition to watch around halloween and again around christmas ! jack is the very best !
ordered by mistake . wanted & # 34 ; catching fire . i already have this movie and it extremely good and follows the book well .
great buy great story . i highly recommend this series you will not be disapointed money well placed in adding this to your collection .
my children have seen all three versions of this movie , and all three of my children agree , this is the best movie to watch .
this purchase was made after a friend shared her copy with me . i decided to make it a part of my collection as i knew that i would enjoy watching it more that once .
was a gift for my boyfriend . we loved the movie and showed it to his entire family . very good story too , would recommend to all ! good seller experience too , arrived fast .
some of these movies were ok and some were old movies . most are b movies , but a fair value if you want to add to your collection .
this is one of the funniest and most underrated movie of all time . it is a great , hilarious show with many great stars .
had this on dvd but wanted to see it in all the glory that j ford intended . i am very pleased .
great movie for the entire family . high quality resolution is great . family had great time watching this movie . need more like them .
mac is the man . love this period of kids movies . takes me back to my youth . always a pleasure to watch
this is a great show and i would say everyone should watch it and enjoy . it has action and fun . i think it is great .
not a fan of the actors ' portrayal . more a fan of the more serious versions of batman . prefer the newer versions .
first liam neeson movie i have watched . the plot is good and the acting is great ; for the most part believable .
i found the movie to be humorous and an enjoyable watch . of course not the greatest movie i have ever seen , but well worth renting through the instant video service .
this is more of a thriller than a horror movie . decent but not great . predictable for the most part . not scary at all .
probably in the top three of his movies ever . superior performance , great story , travolta at his best , fine supporting cast
there are some really good ones , and i am looking forward to watching the rest . however will let you know later .
wife and i enjoyed this very much . good story line , good acting , good action scenes , good soundtrack . we recommend this movie .
good movie good actors . a keeper overall . i do n't know this one as well as the others but all in all a good movie .
really good film and an outstanding performance from diana ross , michael jackson and the rest of the actors . it will keep you and your kids entertained !
very enjoyable , sweet story and well acted . little sad at the end . i would recommend it for a nice evening 's viewing .
this is a wonderful , not well known ( at least to me ) flick with a great plot and a lot of humor thrown in .
have loved this movie since the first time that i watched it ! ! great story ! ! ! adam sandler is always great ! ! !
this is so touching . i am afraid they do n't make many good movies anymore . i wonder what has happened to people 's taste these days
it is a great book . i loved it . it is great . even my husband read it . now my friend is .
i was extremely happy with the delivery time , and movie was in condition as stated , would by again . yours truly happy customer .
most of the stories told here i had seen before . nothing special for me here . i should give it a 2 star rating .
great movie lots of exciting features it shows an in depth story about the making of the hobbit and the movie is wonderful
this is a great show . great action & adventure , and the main character is always trying to do the right thing in very complicated circumstances . a must watch tv series !
this movie was your average vampire movie but was still really good . i was surprised that an obvious low budget film was so good .
good story line that keeps you coming back for more . we look forward to watching the conclusion of this first season and will likely move on to watching season 2 .
very low budget and the actors are horrible . the title and cover looks good but this movie will make you upset after purchasing .
cute movie - good for adults as well as kids . my husband especially liked it and he usually only likes the shoot 'em up kind of movies ! ! ! i highly recommend this movie !
xmas gift for 2012 for my son , he 's been wanting this dvd for some time . i cant wait till he opens it
i love the characters , rich and real . perfectly cast . the emotions and lessons are wonderful . i 've watched it twice and will watch again .
being a fan of the planet of the apes , i believe this is a great installment into the series and a great different way to approach the film !
excellent film ! absolutely love wes anderson ! great to watch with your kids ! shipping was quick , and a great price for blu-ray . got the digital copy right away . great product for anyone to buy !
just not my kind of movie . did n't enjoy it . i should not of brought it . it will be more careful in ordering .
i just ca n't explain it . i just do n't like it . i do n't like the gore aspect i guess , i would n't want kids watching this , but i see gore is in .
not the best movie i 've seen but if you just need a couple of laughs this movie is a good one to watch .
enjoyed movie years ago , and was excited to get again . enjoyed singing along with the movie and remembering the story .
think of the worst movie you 've ever going to see . it must be better then this was . it was boring
i was really blown away by how good the 3d was on this one . in my top 10 best 3 d movies . i have over 25 of them . check this one out .
one of katherine hepburn ` s finest performances ! certainly her best tv movie performance ! writing , directing , cinematography , costume design all above average !
when it comes to family movies and fun , its hard to beat disney . great picture and great sound ; these movies never get old !
the girls in the first two versions had some appeal , and the bad guys were sort of believable . this version lacked both elements .
for the love of cowboys this is a must see . robert duvall and tommy lee jones are at their best . excellent story about a long journey and the friendship between two great cowboys .
who does n't like scooby doo ? everyone grew up watching this character . i did , my children and now my grandchildren . i love mysteries and i would recommend it to everyone .
this story shows the effect the important people have on our life , as well as the importance of quality of life .
ordered this as a gift , great price , very funny i would recommend this
another great stallone movie . high speed all go no quite living the fast life movie . great storyline and great acting
this is a great movie for the whole family . especially if you are into baseball and love a good laugh !
my five year old grandson loved these short stories and found them very entertaining , laughed a lot and wanted to see them again immediately .
ok , we know this collection will be the ultimate , so lets stop wasting time with these reviews and stars and come out with volume two .
one of my all time favorites especially to give to kids . i rate this among the best especially for general audience movies .
i love this show . probably the best hbo series made to date . if you never had the chance to watch the series i suggest you give the sopranos a shot .
great way to buy just the seasons you need or really liked . great price since these are hard to find . and i loved the free shipping and quick delivery .
love watching these old sci fi movies . the land unknown is rather hard to find and is really a good movie for its time period . i remember watching it when i was a kind .
i love this movie , it 's hilarious and has a nice message . jim carrey did an excellent job on this one .
i have not seen this dvd yet , but do like the movie . i viewed this earlier , and decided to buy my own copy .
