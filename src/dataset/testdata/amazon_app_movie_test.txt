do n't buy . filled with bugs , the worst is that there are 2 week tournaments that then do n't pay out the prize . complete rip .
i love this game . the levels get harder and harder . you should get it . i recommend it . the levels are fun .
starts off pretty easy . then builds up . only flaw is if you need to use a cheat , it takes a lot of your earned coins . you have to purchase more .
my husband and i love this game ... .i ca n't get it away from him as he continues each level . excellent graphics , holds your attention and not boring . our favorite game !
i like bingo , but this version is too busy . i like the speed . it 's the graphics and loud music levels that turn me off . it 's a good thing it 's free .

printer share is better if you have a tablet , can print anywhere , but this did not work for me . sorry
its fun but really challenging . pictures are clear but very well hidden . overall i think its a great game . i highly recommend it to everyone who loves hidden object games .
one of the easier guessing games , but fun nonetheless . it could use some instructions , but i was able to figure it out relatively easily .

i t i s t h e b e s t g a m e e v e r y o u n e e d t o g e t i t
as you move through the levels , it gets tougher . but it is fun to see how long it takes to get through it . i still have n't finished 2 of the levels
this game is really fun and i really enjoy the different levels it has and i also like that since there 's an easy medium and hard it makes it more nice to younger kids and older kids
the kids did n't like this app so much . they got bored with it fairly quickly and no longer used it so it was uninstalled .
a great game . it is a strategic game . i have to at least play it to and from work everyday .
i did not know if this was going to work with my kindle fire but it does and i can see what is happening on facebook . the only drawback is that you can not play the facebook games
glad i do n't have to spend money in-game to enjoy it . earning upgrades is the way to go . much better than buying everything .
i like it but do n't love it because it is a little touchy when you go to tilt the kindle to move the ball . but i love the 3d !
very fun game . also a game that you will play all the way through more than once .
while it is fun to play , after a few rounds my kindle fire freezes up and i have to restart it . takes the fun out of it because i know it 's coming .
this is a great time killer . i ordered it for free downloaded in 5 seconds . so far it has been a good game . i recommend this game to anyone .
this is a fun game . in each level you must figure out what to pick up and where to use it .
this is so good i love ot so much and i like the themes . you should get this app.it is the best
i really like this it keeps you mind thinking and your eyes moving all the time great game thank you
this app is very helpful to me , it helps me remember when the last time was , helps me keep track
if you r into the wwe you need this app . keep up to date and be interactive during shows . just fun ! `` feed me more ''
same issue ... fantastic gameplay , and superb game and excellent graphics and free download and then they ask i to pay for better weapons .
this was a much needed item for the kindle . it was a great item to add . downloads quickly and fast .
it 's just like sims . not as good , but still really cool . a lot of my friends have enjoyed this game so i 'm not alone .
well hidden ! most of the time , need the hint . however you can at least see what you are looking for . it 's fun playing .
i wanted to access facebook on my kindle . this does it , and does it well . it 's free , too . good app .
it was fun playing solitaire . got stumped a few times . would like a little more animation . was great playing against my friends .
i love the challenge and its very addictive and fun force you to use your head and to think faster
it is a fun game . so far no issues . i do n't like how i have to post a review or like on facebook to go further in the game .
this game is horrible . when i exited the game it kept playing the music even when i turned my device off crazy annoying . do n't get this game .
my granddaughter downloaded this . she is so into zombies . she loves this game and plays it whenever she 's with me
its alright i just wish there were more options like following and saving the places you like on my kindle fire hd .
finished in a day . my 3 yo niece was able to complete the game with out a problem , needs more of a challange
my daughter loves this app . she enjoys the fact that the picture spins while she puts the color on it .
this is a good game . its entertaining but it can gets boring after a while . it entertains my baby cousin . the key is 2 sell as many fish as possible
my kindle fire started to flash and then the screen turned black then white then came back fuzzy i quickly pressed the home button and got out of it and it almost broke my kindle . do n't get please
i accidentally hit play but was n't done . it needs to check and see if you really want submit your answer before it goes through . also the advertisements get really annoying .
i do not care for a game that you can not play without having to keep spending money just to finish the game !
great game if you like shooting games ... however , i do n't like the cost to purchase slots ( could be a lot cheaper ) . everything else is good .
it is an awesome game to play to i really love to play it because i think real hard to play it
love this game . so far very good graphics and music is ok. if u like puzzle type games . give this one a try .
a must download ! a real time killer . if you never played this , you will become addictive . you can easily pass & play to friends around a table or in the car on road trips .
this is a fun way to pass the time . no real mind skill but a good way to keep the reflexes sharp .
like that i can color code my notes . date is easy to find as well for each note . overall very useful .
this is a fun app that you can use when you 're bored . i do n't know why people are complaining about inappropriate ads , because i do n't see any . i highly recommend this app .
i think this is a great app ! i still like wedding salon better though . i bought the full version of both and it is worth your money ! i think it is great for all ages .
do not use it much but it is fun to play . like to bowl and do n't get out much . i work 40 hours .
fun game . wish you could upgrade the weapons quicker . just started to get ads in between levels . not too bad
i love this game it reminds me of the times i used to horse back ride keeps me busy when there is n't much to do love the graphics
it 's basically scrabble . it 's fun though . there 's not much more to say . i have no more to add but i have to because the thing says i need more words .
i love bingo ! ... i would playing that all day with it and keep up the good work on this awesome bingo go go kindle yeah !
absolutely cute and fun to play . it could have a little more animation with the characters , but super cute as it is and addicting to play .
i can finally watch the current seasons of my favorite tv shows instead of having to wait until the season is over and hopefully watch it on netflix !
this was downloaded for my husband who occasionally likes to play it . he apparently likes it because he plays it a lot .
i deleted this it was not fun and not very interesting . i would not suggest it for kids to play either
this is a good app , it works as intended and is not at all disappointing . i would recommend it to anyone .
i have n't played this one as much as some of my others , but it is very much like the casino slot game .
very addictive and lots of fun . great that there is a little story to go along with it . lots of fun to play against family and friends . so glad i can have it on kindle now .
found it difficult to use . i have other & # 34 ; in a row & # 34 ; games i liked better . i play candy crush and bubble combo
i enjoy playing this game on my down time . it can be challenging to figure out , yet fun to do .
a good game using strategy and luck . very addictive when planning where to place the coins . cute graphics and prizes .
i thought this was going to be easy but you really need to think your moves at least 3 to 4 in advance . this is a great mind game .
love this game ! i play these games and so far this is the best one i 've found . best of all , i do n't have to wait for moves .
you should all get this incredible game ! i have all the salon games and they are my favorite ! best game ever ! ! !
it lets u tap on it way easy , since the real one makes it less easy when u use ur feet .
this is fun game and i would recommend it to everyone who like a word games and who likes challenges
love this game i like the building and fixing things and how you can go fishing and shot bad guys and collect money
i just got introduced to this game by my friend and it rocks . i think you should think about getting it .
don ` t like the facebook part to collect some of the winnings . but like graphics and kills time when don ` t need to think .
i enjoy puzzle games , and this is a good one . i have not had any of the problems other reviewers have mentioned . the game lives up to its press .
i like checking the weather in my area when i have not had the time to check out the news , i have this on my kindle and it works well enough for a quick check .
i like to play spider it is fun and i really enjoy it . everyone should try it and see how fun it is .
invite some people over , make some drinks and go for it.. some are easy , some hard , but the game is a lot of fun
very entertaining . hooked after the first round . looks easier than it is but still mindless enough to play while hanging out waiting in long holiday lines .
only downloaded this for the minute it took me to open it then i closed it and took it off my device .
this is one of the best match 3 games i have found so far . even if you ca n't make it through all the matches its still fun to keep trying . makes time fly by .
love this app n all this fashion . designs are great . selections are fun and backgrounds too . can spends hours on this app .
great app for saving money . i have used gas buddy for years when traveling now can get a quick update before going to the local station .
layout a little different but from what i 've seen it 's youtube . a a a a a a a a a
this is a fun game ! play this game for loads of fun ! i love th gems instead of coins to buy stuff in this game .
entertaining hidden object game . played it during a cross country flight and the time seemed to fly by . i would recommend it .
this game is as fun as it looks . i never write reviews but `` this game is worth it ! '' i read in another review .
i this is a very fun and very challenging game . good for older children and adults . definitely worth the try .
tiny bird is fun to play with friends and family because there is no connecting to facebook ! i had lots of fun with this game .
i have truly enjoyed playing this game . i love word games anyway so it is a great way to challenge you to think .
all you can do is keep tapping on a page and see if something happens . no directions what so ever . uninstalled .
this game seemed fun at first , but then would not run smoothly . after several interruptions over several days , i removed it !
i am still trying out the free version before purchasing the other version . the card game seems to be more entertaining .
the visuals in this game are gorgeous . whoever did the design did a wonderful job i looked forward to each new scene . the game play was good . could be a little harder .
the game is great , smooth graphics , wish there was n't so much player vs player . some people just do n't want to deal with other players so often . maybe a leave me alone option ...
fun but needs more shake up options . other similar coin games have a shake up bar so you can get more coins and prizes .
it took me a few minutes to get the hang of it . it is fun to feed the dragons and watch them grow .
love it fun and entertaining to the brain uses a lot of strategy have to really use your head if you were back in the day although i 'm not from back in the day
very great battery reminder . allows you to know when you are about to run out of battery life . recommend to others .
this is a great game . it runs great on my fire and is very fast paced . easy to learn , i 'm sure my 9 year old daughter will enjoy it too .
this app is the best in world get it ! very good app ! i love it very fun games for kids !
i 'm glad they updated this app to include a single player board . i like to use it while i wait for words with . friends .
i loved playing this game on the computer nice it 's so much easier on my kindle fire . love it , it 's bigger blocks so i can see the board better .
this is a super fun game , another great free game from amazon . keeps you on your toes , love it ... thanks again so much ...
the app works good . it is fast and plays whatever you are doing . you should get this app its worth it b
i love this game , it is hilarious to play . i ca n't draw worth a darn , but i somehow am doing well with draw something ! ! ! !
i enjoyed watching these old movies and television shows . i wish we could listen the old time radio shows on streaming rather than downloading . all in all a pretty good app .
i sometimes ca n't get the words to come about in my brain . i will keep on trying to come up with the right words
great app , it is nice that verses come up every day . it is nice to be reminded of what god does for us
i love this app . it is so much fun , especially when you get other people involved . i love , love it .
i like it . could be a little harder though . i get through the levels quite fast . be good for older kids .
i was expecting more , i was n't overly impressed with this port . i got it when it was the free app of the day , and uninstalled it that day
i really enjoy this game and the way it works - very entertaining and love the cat addition i bought
its an awesome app . this app will help you prepare your self before you head into a casino . big help ! ! ! !
this is a great challenge if you like bejeweled you may like this game . at the top you are required to complete the number of the color to go to the next level .
this game was a pretty good game . of course i love these kinds of games and can play them for hours but still i think any body could like this game
the game starts out real easy but after a while it becomes more challenging and that 's what i like , a challenging game .
this game you cant put the girls hair so i deleted it and you mostly have to unlock everything also you cut all of her hair
this app was just not what i thought it was . i was looking for an app to help track my budget and spending .
this game is lots fun and lots of bonus games ! good payouts and does not take long to get to next levels ! highly recommend this one ! h
this game is challenging and entertaining but difficult ... but if it was n't it wouldnt be interesting . i wish it had more hints though for free .
the greatest game ever it 's definitely worth the money but warning its addicting i would give it a million stars if i could it 's a great game for all ages have fun if u get it
great classic game to play , wife and daughter play 's this alot and love 's word search fun , great choice to buy .
this is a great game to teach you how to spell and find words at the same time . anyone can play this .
this is an okay game , but has too few puzzles , and is not very responsive . there should be three times the puzzles . it 's fun while it lasts .
i originally got this game for my phone from google and was very happy to find it here for my kindle fire . very cute game !
this has got to be the best game on the kindle fire that i have ever played . i 'm addicted . totally with the buck ! !
the camera on the kindle fire hd is nothing to write home about , so this app does the best it can with what little it has to work with .
it seems good ; however kindle fire does not have the software to make it work . i did not even received it in the device
i really enjoy playing mahjong so i downloaded this game and i really like it . smooth game play and nice graphics .
it was a good game to start with . but then you have to buy the full version . did not want to play that much to play rest of it .
my granddaughters got bored with this game quickly . must be an age thing ?
i love this app i use it all the time ! it 's really fun but i wish it could have special effects that 's what it needs but other than that i think it 's good : )
love this game . i sit down after work and play it over and over to unwind . it keeps my mind moving and is fast paced . try it out .
love it ! i play it as a single solo player and it is a great way to keep an `` old '' mind active .
i really dislike the ads on the bottom of the screen , very annoying and it messed up a couple of my games , other then that i love the app and also download it for my new phone !
first of all i got this on my kindle and for some reason it deleted everything i ever built . this should be fixed
very good . i reccomend this cuz it is fun however like any game it gets old . but overall it is good
i love that this game is very very very very very very very very very very very very very very cool .
fun . gives a story while you advance with the game . pictures were clear and fun . gives hours of fun . not to difficult .
i so cool its really fun an it just gives me some thing to do and the best part is its free !
i love the holy bible on my kindle . so easy to use and come very useful . when looking up scriptures
highly recommend . easy to set up and play . i 've become addicted to bingo and this one is at the top of my list
saw that it was a limited offer , so deleted it . i do n't think this camera would be what i needed .
if you like word search games this is fun . the game is free and the puzzle are always different . enjoyable game that will keep you busy for hours .
this is a fun easy game , my son really likes it , this is not violent so it is a good game
easy to understand and fun to play . still a learning curve because this is not you normal match 3 game .
yes i have played the original release of this game on pc but really enjoy it on my kindle fire .
i keep all my notes on it during meetings and just reminders for me for daily things . can 't do with out it . no need for paper and pencil with this app .
this game is kinda hard because when you are tapping one of the little squares to clear it , you have to hit it twice , so you might hit another square and clear that one .
this app is dumb it wo n't let me play do n't and i mean do not get it . it looks like fun but it is not .
my daughter has this on her kindle fire and she likes it ok but she does n't play it very much .
this is the type of game you spend hours and hours trying to finish it.it makes you think everytime you finish each level .
love sharing videos from youtube . this is the perfect app to do so . never had a problem with it and the sound is great .
i think i will like this only had it for a little bit . i will up date when i have had it longer .
just got it , lots of fun . have n't really got the hang of it yet but enjoying getting to know it . match three + is fast becoming a favorite .
the is great it is my 5 favorite game . another reason y i like it is because the animals are so so cute
it will be nice to get local news when we are on vacation . so far , i really like it . great !
very interesting free game . it is very addicting . those are logos we see almost everyday . some are never heard of . we have to search nonlinear and learn even more .
if you love listening to music you will really enjoy this app . i can not spend a day without playing at least one of my stations . you decide what you want to listen to .
fun , with great graphics . it 's by far the best horse game amazon has . i like how they give you gems for free as a gift .
it is an alright app but gets really boring after a while . they need to put a new photo on it each day instead of keeping all of these same photos .
some of the graphics took a while to load but this was still a fun adventure to play . creative ! will play more games from g5 .
this is a very fun game . it is easy and yet challenging all at the same time . it is fun to try to guess it with just the first picture . some you can and others not .
would love to have the lyrics board for the tablet , but no go from what i found . i do n't like this one at all . too complicated to use
would be better if we did n't have to pay for tokens or earned them faster . been playing on kindle fire and runs smoothly no problems as of yet .
this game is awesome . i have a hard time putting it down . its so addicting but so much fun . love it
one of the best free apps of the day ever ! had i known how good it was i would have paid for it . great game .
i have this and 1 other app for files on my kindle fire . they both work great . explore your kindle fire just like you would your computer with windows explorer .
love facebook have it on my computer , love that i can talk to cousins and friends that live far away
addictive ! it took me a minute to catch on , but now i ca n't put it down ! ! ! it 's a must have ! definitely worth buying !
can not play on droid . would love to play , bit does not go past the first level splash screen . reinstalled and had the same problem .
what a great way to learn and laugh at some great quotes while solving some very clever puzzles . highly recommended . note to developers : please make frequent updates . i must have more !
this is a fun game that will keep you entertained for hours . the graphics are good and the clues are sometimes challenging . i will be trying all of the quest games .
my son comes every day and say grandma when my home work you think i can have a little bird time .
i down loaded this by mistake . i tried the game and it worked well however it is not one of my favorites . i would rather play hearts and other card games available .
i love this app it 's easy to use and very handy . this is my new favorite app and will be using it daily .
great game . works good on my kindle 2nd generation . only thing is it needs an instruction guide . i had to ask my grandson how things worked .
i like this fun game ! it is great to pass the time when i can not get wifi . i play it in the car on long trips .
i feel very stupid in the game because i get the right word but i do n't know how to enter the word but it is fun to draw it but you have to buy it it is n't free
have n't got my first phone yet but this app is just as useful . u can text people who have phones or u can text people with the app . i highly suggest this app .
this game is a lot of fun . its a good way to pass time . the graphics and pictures are great . i would definately recommend this game !
started out working , but today it shows up blank . shame as it was a great app . it was a great idea , until it stopped .
worst bingo game ever . bingo blitz is the best bingo game worth downloading . all the others including this one are boring and a waste of time .
i have always loved hidden object games ! this one is pretty cool ! it took awhile to download but was n't disappointed . i could spend hours doing these !
do n't waste your time not fun there are better hidden objects out there that are way more fun i am sorry that i wasted my time on this
this app is really amazing . it lets me do things with my own horse . i really like that , also i 've always wanted a horse so this is as close as i 'll get to one .
this is basic match 3 game but the way the give goals makes it fun to go back again and try to gain 3 stars for each game .
fast moving game that keeps you thinking all the time . would recommend to all ages . helps with eye hand coordination .
this is a nicely done application . in timed mode being able to get all the possible solutions for the 5 character version is hard , but it is impossible when playing with 7 characters .
i like the game very much . it is addictive and mind boggling . it makes you think inside and outside the box .
started out good . some good game play . small glitches that i hope they fix quickly . overall a good game with good potential .
this is a great game . i enjoy playing this game . my children also enjoy playing this game . this is a game that challenges your mind . simply for that i give it four stars .
i love yahtzee , and this is it ! i also love that fact that you can play others live . if you like yahtzee , you will love this !
i do not recommend this app . it was not fun at all , and it seemed to be very , very slow .
really fun like a small journey ... . you can create your on stick person and go on your way to find a friend ... . : )
have n't played this one as much as some of the other games . maybe when i get the hang of it i will enjoy it more .
this one presents enough of a challenge to keep it interesting . just when you think the phrases are easy , you get some that are more challenging .
this app gives you a lot of stuff that people would like to buy and some of them ca n't but gives you lower prices than they usually are .
it is an ok app but you cant race anyone you just build cars if you like building cars get this app but if you only like racing then do n't buy it
good app to kill time : - ) i would highly recommend this app and i play everyday on my lunch break . i got a lot of people playing along
it seems like a decent enough game but slow at first and i am not too fond of having to spend real money for little reward
really fun game , have the paid version on my android phone and am planning on getting it for the kindle too .
okay i guess , not quite like the iphone version and some pics are rather confusing and some do n't really relate
i was just on this today and it now sucks . it wo n't let me download videos now and it makes me upset because this was amazing until that happened ...
this game is really cool . love the story . the graphics are cool . puzzles get progressively harder . you should get this great game ! enjoy !
saw the other reviews about not working on the fire i also had problems picking up items at first but worked fine after a few minutes . it did take a little longer to install .
there are only so many options that are free . the game is wonderful for learning and keeping kids interested , but after a while , they 've mastered what is free .
did not blow me away , but it was ok. like the option of choosing different games , but hate to ask friends for chips
just a good basic news app . easy to use , stories are listed well . a good quick go to for the top stories .
i download this game for my son we thought it would be fun based on the graphics but he doesnt like it .
my son played this out quickly . it 's cute , but there 's not much to it . he is 2 1/2 and he completed all of the puzzles very quickly .
love this game . it gets harder each level . . . i still have a couple that i cant seem to pass . i just wish there were more .
its super cute and super fun if you dont like then is something wrong because its awesome and i really love it
get this game . it will get people having fun all around the world ! if you are wondering if i love it . you are correct ! thank you amazon
fun but some design flaws to make you spend those gold coins by mistake . i had no restart issues but my husband 's game crashed and he had to restart it
my kids love this game . me of course keeps running into things . all in all its a pretty good game ! ! !
easier to riddle through than 100 floors . better clues and more fun . like searching the rooms and putting the hints and tools together .
it is an amazing game . ca n't get enough of it ! ! ! the creator of this game should make more like this .
it was an ok game for the time it took me to play . good for an afternoon to waste time .
fun game to play ! ! ! reminds me of sim city . will enjoy for a long time . i would recommend to my friends .
i love this game . its awesome . its so fun . its amazing ! ! you should get it . its like you are really in a tournament . you should really get it .
cool game download its like plants vs zombies and it has a twist to the game it is so so so so so so so so so so so so so fun
i got this by mistake . i do n't really understand it and have n't tried it . i 'll have to study it a bit more .
as far as hidden games go its pretty good not the best one ive ever played but not the worse either i 'm glad it was free for the day it was worth the download .
this game is awesome . but it 's stupid you have to redo some of the missions even though you have already completed them .
game runs very slow on my galaxy s phone , does n't look like there are too many levels . even if it ran ok , i would n't buy it , certainly not for $ 4
this game is a ripoff of pokemon but a good one at that so if you love pokemon get this game
like this game so far . and very easy to play . my children who are special needs can play the game very easily
this game is so awesome ! it is really easy to reach goals but half of them give you a do able challenge !
the sounds are just okay . it would be nice if you could see them all at once then choose the ones you want .
i love this game . some days i just go on and on , others i ca n't seem to build enough words . but it is definitely a great game !
this game was the most challenging game ive ever played , it was fun and i recommend it for all ages . the best game ever
got ta love this game . it 's awesome . i love the sound effects and how it 's interactive . great for kids to play .
it is so awesome ! it 's addicting . i do n't have to buy another app for a long time . and this one is free !
it wants my info ? no way ! ! ! i made a submit that wants my info was a bad choice for those people who agree with me .
i do n't know how to explain this except awesome ! the graphics are amazing and the fish are just like real life and the game itself is almost as good as minecraft !
the food that i need daily in my life . we all need this app to get us through our lives .
this game is so much more than playing . this game is a great memory aid for mentally challenged people . it 's also wonderful for early readers . i highly recommend this game .
i like this game . it is fun and exciting and really challenges you . it is very hard as well . i like it .
i am very addicted to this game ! love the colors and how easy it is to play it . totally recommended .
this game is the best and if you do n't like it this game is not for you but this game is the best
this is my favorite game ... i play with my mom or my family when i ca n't play an actual game with them
this is a cute . and interesting . little . game . that my little girl just love it keeps her entertained . just watching it .
could n't figure out how to play this game . there are n't any directions that i could find with the game . i deleted it .
the response time on play is excellent . i like the scoring system . i recommend this version to friends . i play often .
this app can be hours of addictive fun . it is so simple & amp ; yet i just ca n't seem to put it down .
i gave this a four star rating as i enjoy playing the game but wish you could earn some things instead of having to purchase them .
it was dumb and not entertaining at all . i play games to wind down after a busy day at work and this was boring .
to be honest , i thought this was n't bad at all . turns out , i was wrong . the graphics are bad , and the fact that it has in-app purchasing . do not get this app .
the stupid app would not load at all i am very very very very mad at tiny co i will never get a tiny co app again .
love this app ! ! ! simple , addicting , awesome ! ! ! i could just sit and play this game over and over again ! ! no suggestions for the developers , great job guys ! !
such a simple idea but a great fun game to play with friends and family . still a novice but learning and loving it !
this app is so awesome and it lets you do anything and it is the most funniest app i 've ever played ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! : )
always a game that relax my mind while playing cards good eye contact too i just love it and look for to winning alot
i do n't have this app but my friend does and i played it once on her kindle fire and it was sooooo much fun ! ! so i really think it deserves 5 stars .
i did n't realize how many different moving vehicles are really out there . so much fun to figure them out . i did n't know i knew a lot about them

i play it with my sister . this is a really fun game . u should get it . i love it so much .
i like knowing the weather so thanks but this twenty or more word thing is a bit too much ... i 'll be honest with the stars
its a challenge but its fun . and if you have trouble just find cheats on youtube . its really a good game !
pretty fun game only thing is you seem to lose more than you win and takes too long to get to a decent daily bonus . fun but glad i did n't have to pay for it .
its a good game and i like it but i think its a little over priced . i should have gotten the ad-free version for 0.99 .
ice age is very fun and fun to create my dogs love watching the animals . everyone will enjoy young and old
this game was just plain boring . i thought i would like it but there was no true challenge to it .
this is another one of my addictive game . once i start it , it 's hard to put it down . i love it .
this is perfect its never slow running and this is an app that you always want to come back to because there 's something new everyday
this game is great for challenging the mind as well as allowing a person to sharpen their puzzle working skills .
i do enjoy a good bingo game . this one keeps me well entertained ... for good periods of time . thanks gamers . keep up the good work .
i really like this game a lot , but sometimes only 4 dice show up ! i still like it , though , and it was worth the 99 cents i paid for it .
this is nice to watch when you ca n't watch tv , my daughter wanted to watch a movie , but i had to go to bed so she downloaded it on her ipad and went in her room .
this is a very cute game i put it on my kindle fire for my grandkids but iv been playing g it more than them . i love it .
love to play this - it gets more challenging as you go along . i can see this being a fun game for all ages .
my 5 year old son loves this game ... it is a great tool to get little kids interested in math . he can play this game anytime he wants too .
does exactly what it claims . its a slightly new twist on an old game . easy to learn with lots of levels from very easy to very hard . works great on my kindle fire . thanks
this is like temple run , but a lot more fun . i recommended this to 10 friends . best app ever , ever .
this was a good first game of a good game series . in fact i give it a ten out of ten .
i was looking for an easy to use simple calculator and this is it . nice big buttons and easy to read .
i have enjoyed each round of golf ; especially the use of multiple strategies to get the highest score . thanks big fish for a challenging game .
works even better on my kindle than my i phone . : ) love it ! highly recommended to anyone who has a netflix account . : )
dumb game , hard to play and not easy to figure out . would n't get this one again if i had a choice .
great app if you dont wan na give someone your cell number , or if your having cell phone problems , this app helps a load .
a cute app for some small children . my daughter played it for 5 minutes but it does n't have enough to make it more fun .
it 's a pretty fun game . definitely has tested my ability of to be more focused and not rush through things .
the kids are always on this one ! if we get a new device they put it back on . they are 8 & 9 and love it
oh it is so so so so so so so so so fun buy it it is awesome ! fashion is the key ! i love love it
it 's a great gun sim but it needs more guns . buy it and wait a couple months and it will have a lot of guns .
this is the first hangman game that i downloaded that i have liked well enough to keep on my kindle . every other one i was disappointed in .
awesome app ... does what it 's supposed to do . runs fast and smooth on my droid 2. graphics are decent and the selection of games is superb .
what can you say its an app for facebook , it works for what i need it and does whats needed ,
i think that bubble ball is an awsome game because you get to see a little bubble roll so cool
this is a fun and entertaining game that i spend many hours a week playing . i have fun competing with my kids .
i really enjoy this game . it 's fun to play it with my friends on facebook . it works great on my kindle fire
i enjoy playing this game . it looks easier than it actual is . when i get down to the hidden object i use the hint button
i like the graphics for the slots on these games . also , like the video poker aspect - like playing poker , but never do well when i play ; so am practicing with this game .
this game totally beats flappy bird i love it if you like flappy bird you will like this game very very very addicting though so be careful love this game it rocks must download
this game is fun and very addictive . i find i best to save up your diamonds and spend them , only if you need to .
this app do n't show you how to do it it just show you the picture like you can read what it is saying . horrible
i like this game . it is fun though frustrating at times . it can take many tries to complete some of the levels .
my 8 year old is very disappointed . we can not get beyond the start page . do n't waste your time or money !
this app is not only fun but it also has a few educational games on it . plus , it does n't constantly want your $ $ .
another game , which i do more often than others , this takes more concentration than most games , and gives me more challenges .
stupid game ! gives no directions & amp ; not fun at all what a waste of time ! ! ! if you think this is awesome you really are way too easy to please .
it 's solitaire , so there is n't much to mess up . always a fan of the game and this version is great . and you ca n't beat the price ... free ! highly recommend .
always liked this game growing up . well played on the tablet . great addition to my game collection in my apps .
this is really fun . i like that you can personalize almost everything . i also really like that they did a bunch of the games like other popular games .
this game has a lot of action that 's very easy to get addicting to . it also does n't really require you paying in app purchases like most free games make you do .
it 's solitaire - how bad can someone screw that up . it works well , i enjoy playing alone because i do n't play well with others .
played a lot and crazy about it . every body is playing and it too much now and stop it now .
i 'd like this crossword app a lot better if it did n't keep constantly asking me to review it after every completed puzzle .
it would be decent to have more game modes and maps but this game as nice gameplay good graphics and lots of guns to kill with !
this is a great game fun for all ages . come join the fun . i love to come home from work and go straight to the game .
favorite bingo game . only complaint ... bingo chips go so quickly so not a lot of play time . otherwise ... . this is the best .
i can not wait until my grandson gets his kindle with this app . i played this and it was soooo much fun . i wonder if he will let me use his kindle to play this game ?
i love this game . i actually bought it for my grandson but i play it more than he does . it 's challenge to get 3 stars sometimes but i keep trying .
there are a few episodes available if you do not have a cable provider but you get more if you do .
when i click start i cant play it just shows the title it happens every time i try to play it i do n't even know what this game is like
this is a pretty fun game . it really gets your mind working sometimes . hope they update with more levels soon .
my grandson down loaded this one on my kindle fire and he seems to like it i dont play it but he likes it .
its super awesome . do n't listen to any of the haters . works perfectly on my kindle fire . i 'm really glad its free .
i love crosswords and there are much better free apps available out there instead of buying this one , no matter how cheap .
the game is ok , got old for me pretty quick , but is a fun concept . if the price is right i recommend it .
ok app if you like looking for one type of object per screen . i prefer to look for a variety of objects instead of one .
good game fairly addictive great time waster would recommend to anyone . my kids also love it . was easy for them to figure out the controls .
practice and more practice in an easy to handle application . i 've already spent some hours practicing the quizzes and by doing so , i will be ready for the test .
i have this on my phone also . gives me accurate radar . and the alerts are great . i would recommend this app .
this game is kind of fun . if you want a free , laid back card game to pass the time by , you should consider getting it
my kindle would not allow this to be installed . could be a user error because it works great on my cell phone .
the game rocks , i love it . it is really kinda violent but when you get better weapons you kinda feel awesome .
after awhile it becomes very boring . then you just want to delete it i do n't think you should download it
it does what i need it to do . it helped with my phone and i just downloaded it for my kindle but i have n't had a chance to use it yet .
it was fine . i like the app . i just have too many angry birds apps on my kindle . i would not have removed it otherwise .
it is n't for everyone , but it is good for an older person , like me , to keep the mind busy doing different things . i like to play this game during commercials of my favorite shows .
like it because you can watch movies that are not on netflix and even some that are . biggest downfall is that there are still commercials
the game is fun but i think it should give the option to start where you stopped from the previous time and not just at the beginning everytime you go on . maybe i missed something in the instructions .
love this game i have it on my computer but i downloaded and wo n't . work on kindle fire please fix then i could give it the highest rating
this game is soooo much fun . its not to hard but not to easy ... i play it a lot and it loads great : ) no lag ... get now
not really anything special , it gets old quick and then you do n't use it again until you go to clean up your phone .
it 's cute , that is about all , idk what else to say but if you want to try it be my guest yea
i have several of these apps from many tv stations on my smartphone . this is the best of them all ...
i only have 1 problem it is impossible to land . but if you look at everything else it 's nice in a whole
the levels progress and a good rate . it was just easy enough and just challenging enough to keep us going .
love it just fun and also challenging to see how far you can get ,
temple run is a lot of fun once u play its addicting it great for people who love skill games
i like it very much . it is very addicting . i just wish more people would play it . keep coming up with more games !
i love ( ! ! ! ) the game it 's great but for a month it would n't let me play it otherwise i love it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
it 's interesting to play but after a few minutes , you get bored with it . still , if you want something to play , get this .
it 's ok , again , great for waiting room time , or when you have nothing else to do . like the others , there is more than one level , and they get harder as you progress .
this app is pretty good ! it keeps me entertained for a while . i like that there r so many levels ! ! ! !
this game is soon bad it is boring and not fun ! i thought it would be way more fun ! i dont recommend this game for anyone ! ! ! : ( : (
game is fun . it does get a bit redundant though . the biggest challenge is the touch sensitivity as you have to press for a while to get it to register .
i was able to print what i needed to from my kindle . the first app i downloaded did not work .
very challenging . however , with my 7 '' kindle fire , the picture is so small it 's difficult to find some of the objects .
cute characters . fun game . does require real money for some thing 's . good way to waste time . and its free so you cant beat that .
great slot game . would have given five stars but it took forever to download to my kindle . other than that no issues or problems to speak of .
it 's a cute and fun game . i can leave it for a day and come back to lots of activity .
this app sucks , if you buy it on a kindle fire . it ca n't locate a lost phone . do not buy it !
this is quick and informative . my favorite items when looking for a game to play . and it is free too . best combination .
wow ! is just about all i can say about this app . i can shop all day from anywhere and how cool is that !
wished they had a free lite game of this free so could try it first as well as see how it works with the different devices . i wished they make a free one available soon .
love this game it is a good way to pass the time you wont be sorry a good app i would highly reccomend
it makes me feel like i 'm at a casino yet i do n't leave my house and i do n't spend alot of money because i do buy coins when needed .
love the game on kindle hd . was a very smart purchase . should have got it the first day ! ! ! play it everyday ! !
i love this game it is so cool to play if i could well i can but i would stay up all night playing it
this app is pretty cool . i ca n't figure out a lot of these movies but i still play it lol . i definitely recommend it to everyone .
cute but i found them a tad hard to control . although i never am very good at driving or flying games so would probably be better game for someone who really likes them .
i love this game but its not my favorite game and it gets stuck when its loading like on for me it gets stuck for me it gets stuck on 21 and 18 .
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 minutes to download
this is a great game i really like it : ) its awesome if u like words with friends or hanging
i do n't know why everyone is complaining . it is a great game . first you choose your own team and progress through seasons . i recommend it to everyone
this game has added upgrades since i first started to play . now i ca n't go a day without playing because i get a gold coin daily just for logging on . lots of fun .
i had the free version & rarely used it . when amazon offered the pay version for free , i downloaded it & it is now my weather app of choice . much easier to use
really like the graphics . wish we had a little more time to search . i like the way the items we search for are hidden in the pictures . makes it harder to find them
i really enjoy playing this slot game . it is quite addictive and lots of fun . you never know which bonus game you are getting which adds to the fun .
it is fun but it lt reset my account so i uninstalled it . how does it delete my account ! ? that 's really stupid
completely addictive . i have been playing for hours and did n't even realize that i was . i would definitely recommend this for anyone .
it is lots of fun . great for killing time . love that there are different games to chose from . fun for everyone .
i love this app . i play it quite a bit . a recent update caused it to crash but the support i got by e-mail talked me through fixing that .
great app for kids kindle access , free makes it even better . gives my daughter lots of options of drawing and coloring .
i love these kinds of puzzles especially the flippix ones . you cant complain about free . i definitely would recommend this app .
i love i find it fun and some challenging levels some easy u will love it to real cool and it is totally worth everything ! ! ! ! ! : - )
its hard to control but if they made it easier it would be fun , but they made the controls hard . and well its not fun .
this game is so much fun . love the sound effects . the birds are super cute . i can sit and play this forever .
candy crush is a great game ! when i first found out about it i did n't know why people were so addicted to it then i started playing it and i am totally addicted ! ! !

i play this game all the time . the game works flawlessly and is very interesting . i would highly recommend this to anyone who has a phone
what a game . love the challenge and the different levels and vehicles . hooked on the game , do it while watching tv
this is my overall favorite game for the kindle fire hd . great with a big screen . great with a small screen
this game was very entertaining , and oh so very addictive . many of the logos were very difficult but it became a challenge to research the answer . definitely a winner .
i have tried to contact someone to help me get the game open but have not been able to . i can rate the game because i have not played it .
i like the format of this game , and my kid seems to enjoy it as well . we particularly like the characters .
i have always loved logic puzzles and was more than happy to find them for my kindle . love it
boring and i do not like it . might be good game for a 4 yeah old . sorry but needs to be more entertaining
the best game ever for the kindle fire . wow i ca n't believe its finally available for the kindle fire . so addictive and fun . i absolutely love it ! ! ! ! ! !

it is pretty fun . i enjoy it and think it is fun . it is not the same as the original but i enjoy it anyways
this game is great for long car trips . my kids love it . to be honest , i play it to ! great game
this game is really addictive , as well as a great time killer . great sound , wonderful graphics , and no glitches with my kindle fire . truly impressed .
the only reason i downloaded the application in the first place is because it was the free app of the day and i was curious as what it had to do or could do
this game is so addicting and is a game that will make you think plus it gives you a challenge .
this is by far the best game . makes me glad i have the fire . even though i bought it mainly to read . i 'm hooked .
it 's a little glitchy , not the best app ever . not the best quality . however it did help me , and i give it 3 stars .
like this game . i usually ca n't remember names of movies but enjoy this game anyway . most of the time i just guess
the questions are either pretty easy or repeated too much . i have been challenged a bit but not playing too much any more .
i played this all the way through years ago in pc and loved it ... the controls are bad and it froze repeatedly . i deleted it .
wow its one of the best games ever love it and restaurant story and fashion story . great game lots of fun
fun game for anyone to play . my niece & amp ; nephew will steal my kindle once they play it the first time .
i really like this . hope i can go farther on this one than version 1 ! fun for the whole family .
good app but not on the top maybe you guys should try harder next time and seriously how many questions do you guys want to get people to get all the questions
i just did n't care for the looks of the tiles . they were hard to see and just too small . i like the game though .
you watch the baby dance . it is cute cause it moves to many different sounds or music . you like cute . this is for you .
hidden objects quest is a lot of fun . i have this on my kindle fire and when i have a few minutes down i play for a few minutes which goes into an hour .
this is as habit forming as finding words in a crossword puzzle . you are given choices of playing under different conditions . really enjoy ! !
i got this game for my granddaughter that i was visiting . she loved it ! perfect for a little girl .
this is a fun bingo game with cute graphics . easy to play and easy to continue playing without paying which works for me !
this took to long to load . i did n't like the fact that u cant get a good shot because it moved hard to control the aim
my granddaughter and i really like this game . it helps her spelling also . it gives us lots of quality time together .
really fun and u can buy ur favorite dog or any animals ... .if u love games u have to check a lot u will luv this because i luv it
i like all flip pix pictures but the objects in this one were rather boring in comparison to the others i have done
this was a really fun game . the bad part is that it does not save the level u r on . : ( but . still try it out . its really fun .
this is a really good app . it will show you where day and night is at in real time . no matter where you are . this is one of the few apps i keep using .
it 's just a basic notepad , no more no less . perfect for just creating a quick note or a list . i love it !
temple run two is a great twist on the original game with new characters , money , goals , and i love the mine portion of the game .
my daughter loves this app . you get to put makeup on princess . also when you are done with the makeup you can add the pictures to your kindle fire hd
i love this game , can be very addicting . sometimes it is hard to stop playing the game . will recommend this game to others
this is the best game next to flappy bird ( before it was taken off the appstore ) its fun , easy , and awesome ! ! : d
what a fun bingo game ! great app ! thanks for being a free download ! recommend to anyone who loves to play bingo !
love this app , and the social interaction with other stores is pretty spectacular . i just hope the clothes are worth a day of wait ! ! !
we play as a family and challenge one another who can get the most coins in one run . we always have fun with this game .
its just a little book were you touch things and they move . unless your five or under you wont like this app
good game , just like yahtzee , but how do you set it so there are more than 2 players ? i 'd like to play this with my entire family .
to be fair , i did not use this much . you need a constant internet to enjoy this app . if you have internet on everywhere you go im sure this app . is ok to enjoy .
we could n't get this to work on our kindle fire . it would look like it was talking , but it did n't make any sound .
this is an entertaining because you get to maintain your own horse it is very extremely fun to help your horse
this is cool . you have lots of options and i see my 3 year old getting better at her letters and sounds .
great game . fun game . awesome game . do n't like how quick your energy runs out . zombie games are always a good thing . make more .
game is good to play , especially if you have more than one playing . need cheaper hints or better scoring . try it ... .
totally cute and fun matching game . i 'm addicted and telling everyone i know they should play , too , because it 's so much fun !
for a free app it 's great my kids downloaded the app as they know i like hidden object games this was a good choice .
awesome game . one time when i went to play , after playing another game all my progress was gone . other than that , this game is the best game rovio has come up with so far
incredibly fun and addicted game that is great for any age . the recent updates have added a lot of content as well .
it was n't what i expected . it was a maze that you had to get the character through , and i found it tedious and totally boring . just not my kind of game .
it is so fun i like games that you serve burger 's . i love this . game it is fun fun fun
thus game is so fun trying to figure out how to open the doors it 's so amazing i. could play it all day ! ! !
fun but instructions are not to clear on how to move up levels . wish you could make money faster and things were cheaper
this app is great for keeping your grandchildren entertained for short periods of time , especially when they are 2 years old .
what is free is about 5 minutes of game time and then they start asking for money to upgrade , excuse me but free to me means the ( whole ) game is free .
great fun and challenging at times . some of the puzzles are kind of dumb , some are long and get hidden behind the keyboard . but all in all , a fun app to have on my kindle .
so i played it and all the people started fighting me for no reason ! and your energy go 's down super fast
this is a fun and challenging game . easy to play , but not always so easy to win ; which is what keeps me coming back to it again and again .
i really liked it . although the ads are solo annoying , this turned out to be a great game . do n't make bad reviews ! ! !
this game is so good i like it so much it is the best game i ever played i love it so much
it 's a mission so that 's the only reason why i 'm doing this . if you get this game try it before you make up your mind .
good game nice graphics . hate that you have to make out of game purchase to improve play . plenty of hints that you need to buy gold .
i was able to play using just an email account . the game freezes a lot , requiring me to restart my device each time . might be fun if it did n't freeze .
simple straight forward game . if you do not want to buy content , then you have to be very patient . something to do with your hands while watching tv .
this is a really fun game , i love all of the time management games based on the original diner dash .
gives me that little slot fix when i ca n't get to a casino for a while . quite realistic , right down to hardly ever getting the bonus . ha !
my daughter just loves this game . she likes the options you can get and use to make the character look how you want . the characters . the leveling up . the graphics are really nice .
the game is ok but took simple for me . needs to be more challenging . would not have bought if i knew it was this simple .
the whole game does n't make much sense and sends you back and forth . more or less running you in circles .
it is fun and easy to play ! i love being able to design my own home ! ! easy for children too .
this game really challenges your mind . you have to come up with the exact answer and spell it correctly . very addicting !
this game is awesome i absolutely love it ! ! i have 60 kill already ! ! ! ! ! stop reading reviews and get the dang game already
i love this game it 's fun and it gets me entertained and this game is new so that 's my opinion keep posting reviews so people know what you think .
cool game cool game fun addictive takes a while to get better scoring but i enjoy playing cool game try it . you 'll like it .
i love this game , the quest to complete that help earn money , the different wonderful dishes to cook and the best part is that you can set it around your schedule .
okay , i have played better games and this gets boring after a while . this is a good game for kids to play .
it is great with the kindle fire amazing games mostly for all ages it is the best app i can nonstop playing
the side stories make it boring , and some puzzles are not intuitive . ca n't beat free , so it 's still worth playing .
the kindle fire version of this game is my all time favorite . it 's easy to play with your fingers or a stylus and a lot of fun when you have to sit around killing time
love it love it love it get it get it get it best app you 'll . love it bet game i love it
this game is fun , you build your own town and turn it into a city , and nice graphics , if you want to fine a game that you can build a city i recommend this one .
great app ! i ca n't believe all that is packed in this app ! this is a powerful little app ! i ca n't get enough of it ! highly recommended !
this game is a lot of fun . it helps relax me and also keep me occupied . i have found that i like spelling more now that i play this game .
this game was way too easy even at the hardest level . maybe okay for children . i would not recommend this game for anyone over the age of 4 .
i really enjoy playing . it has lots of fun games . they are pretty easy to play and some what addictive
just got this game and already know that it is going to be one of my favorites love the bonus
very easy , laid back games . the graphics are cute . animated . this is a good game for beginners . this game is good for kids of all ages . play bingo
i love this game . pretty challenging the higher you go in levels . great to kill time with . considering buying higher levels at a later date .
seriously the best angry birds ever . it is so fun to play and you never get bored and there is always a challenge .
bought this for my kindle fire . works great . fun game not a real challenging game by any means . but nice game to play when you have a few minutes to kill . worth the small price .
i recommend this to anyone who likes 3 match puzzles , loads of fun , very enjoyable and can become very addictive
nicely designed golf game with good graphics . physics engine seems ok. levels are interesting and game plays well . good times all around .
i did not care for this game . it was not what i thought it would be and i removed it .
the controls are very slow to react . i was disappointed cuz this game seems like it could be fun . it was frustrating with the slow reaction time on the controls i stopped trying .
i really enjoy playing this game . i find it very cute and entertaining . u should get this game cuz its now only fun , but its also free . so give it a try .
when you find super hard puzzles but than you can get it i love it very puzzling and kids put their mind to this game for puzzles !
this has a awesome story line and its so much fun its the best game that has ever been put on the amazon app store
full of fun filled learning . never a dull moment . my daughter loves it . she loves to use this app and learn .
why are people giving a 1 star without even downloading ? thats pretty messed up , if you ca n't do the first level im surprised you can read or write a review
love playing different solitaire games . this one has some i like and others i just do n't get . it 's free too !
i really really love this game.. i sit for hours playing it , i take a short break & amp ; i 'm right back at it . thanks a lot for this app .
i love this app even though some of the stuff is locked . it 's still very fun . i would get it if i were you .
i 'm sorry i did not like this game too much so i uninstalled it . not that fun ... .i do n't know . do n't like it .
worked once or twice , was a good bit of fun . now force closes whenever a goal is made on both my phone and tablet
this game is fun because you go from easy ones to hard puzzles back to easy ones again . this makes it more relaxing to me . wonderful for a free game .
not too bad but kinda slow moving . hopefully will pick up a little bit more as game goes on but very good way to spend time
easy fun . it 's simplicity at it 's best . just what solitaire should be . i use this app as a way to relax and unwind when i 'm stressed .
it is very helpful to me searching for info on my kindle fire . thank you so much for the info to get it .
best game in the world it is your favorite of mine is your favorite game in the world it is a good game
i like card games including several types of solitaire . you can play it when you only have a few minutes to a few hours to kill .
what is it for , not too clear for its objective to learn to play to have fun with , too boring
the game is a combination of a city building , tower defense and a rpg . if you enjoy these types of games , hi will enjoy this one .
i chose the rating of 2 as i thought it was hard to maneuver around on this game and play it . i really didnt like it and deleted it .
this is a fun game to play and on most pictures , you have to really think . the pictures are really cool to look out and most to answer puzzle .
i luv this app . it is really fun and you get to name all of your fish and it is super awesome i luv it .
this game is so cool i played the first one and fell in love i waited for the second one to come usually i do n't pay attention to the free apps of the day but now i will
a version of fruit ninja . i know my math but ca n't seem to slice the correct answer fast enough so my scores are n't too good .
if you like crosswords this is a good one . the concept is simple enough but it 's still pretty addicting ; good
i love this game i liked to be challenged and learn new things that prob forgot thru out the years lol
finally here for kindle fire ! way better than the first , only one thing what about the other people ? ! ? they be gone ! still great app better graphics , more options , awesome !
top girl is one of my favorite games on my kindle so far but i tried it girl and i absolutely hated it .
good game for the price . good graphics and good challenge . more games would be better , free would be better ... but good game for the price
find this game not as much fun as others i 've downloaded . seems slow at times and i often just move on to another game .
i did n't expect much from this app but when i opened it downloaded some maps and went on minecraft i had the maps and i could use them ! ! amazing so much fun ! !
so addictive and fun ca n't wait for more levels to come and i just love perry he is my fave
fun at the beginning but then you get to a level that just does n't work on the kindle even when you know what to do .
the game is okay , but , it 's the same thing over and over . although you can keep trying to get better . so it 's alright .
i like these types of puzzles . i have played many different ones . i think you should get a letter for less coins as it can get to expensive to play .
not only is it fun to keep track i find myself doing more to better the out come . very easy to use , and the information they give you helps alot .
fast and easy way to log on and shop . like being able to find items easily from this app . one tap shop
really fun game with a bunch of funny characters and places you can build trust me you 'll have a blast with this game i know i did !
has so many glitches and force stops . not worth the hassle . i ended up deleting it from my kindle fire .
no clear instructions on how to play and once you figure out the game , it get boring rather quickly . glad i did not pay money for it .
yes very nice app and easy to follow . you will enjoy it very much and will have little to no problem learning how to draw if you 've never tried it before
yes a good job for the kindle for sure keep us busy when we have to pass the time away
i think this game is so much fun you should get it it 's the bomb i love it and you will too
the amount of anime on here is incredible . the ads are simple and quick and the videos load relatively smoothly . i very much enjoy this app .
a awesome graphic and it a fun game you can either play on the kindle or facebook . a good game to played .
i wish each game gave more points it will take a while to complete . but i will keep at it .
never got the rules or any idea how to play it , so just deleted it from my device . it seemed stupid to me .

my daughter loved this ! he is so cute , and the noises he made entertain the baby . they should make a sequel !
i love mahjong , but this is more like a trial game ; it does n't have the full options that regular mahjong has .
this game is sooooo fun . it can get a little hard but that y they give u hints a coins to help u figure them out .
i was looking for matching with friends and this game popped up . i have n't stopped playing since i downloaded it .
too much stuff popping up and it 's got too many choices just to play ! ! ! tone it down , please ! ! i just want to play tetris !
i honestly in my opinion thinks it ducks all it does is makes the screen white okay so do n't get it its stupid . its so stupid i gave it a 0 star
this is my favorite bingo game . it 's fun to play and you can win bingo bucks and coins and do n't have to spend real money . and i got it free ! !
same birds , different backgrounds , new puzzles . nothing really special but still fun to play . it 's ok if you have finished the first one .

its a great and fun game after trying once it will be hard to stop playing install it right know .
a lot of fun . some levels are frustrating . children will enjoy playing this game . it really works your mind figuring out your next move and what color to use .
reminds me of farmville . i love it but the only problem is i do n't have any friends to complete the five friends quest because i dont have facebook , nor do i want it .
if you do n't have this game , download it . i have a lot of fun playing with friends and family and every few months forget about it and come back and have fun all over again = )

this is awsome i cant stop drawing . awsome . very cool . when i found out about the app i had to get it
after a while they start charging for the use of all the & # 34 ; upgrades & # 34 ; . free ? not ! save yourself the trouble . use clean master .
this game is tons of fun to play . there is such a variety of songs and artists . i have learned a lot about songs
cool game to pass the time . u do have to buy full version part way through the game but so far it has been worth it .
i like this game because you can speed it up or slow it down for your kids . i also like how you can upgrade without having to actual buy things
i love this calculator and recommend it highly . it is full screen and is simple to use , and the best part of all is that it is free .
this is great educational game . teaches kids colors , letters , shapes and numbers . my three year old granddaughters loved it . thanks
this is a change from candy crush saga . it 's ok but a bit clunky . i do like that you can see what you need at each stage .
i have not tried this yet but it seems like a copy of office jerk . but i do n't know for sure it just seems like it so ... three stars ?
this is one of the best slot game i have found . lots of bonuses and pays alot too . if you like slots this is one of the best !

if you like word games you will be sure to like this one . it is a lot of great fun .

it takes a good picture . i can keep all my photos here or transfer them to my computer . thank you
if you do n't like then just delete it is not a big deal and do n't bring anybody down just because you do n't like it
it keeps my five year old granddaughter 's attention on short rides across town . not something i would recommend for a brain teaser for anyone over six .
very fun game . i wish it was longer and easier to get items . lol . even though i beat it , still play it off and on .
this is a great app from a great product ! music and reviews on the go , anytime anywhere . i have had this app for a while and truly use it often .
great graphics and good story . puzzles could be more difficult and it could have been longer but a good choice .
an excellent tool that i use daily on my tablet . easy to use and very useful tool . recommend for everyone ! ! !
my 9 year old daughter liked this game the first time she played it . but i dont think she has played it that much . i guess it 's alright for what it is .
this game . is easy to learn and addictive ! i play and my kids love it too . we are all hooked .
i thought it was fun at first but it 's really boring and it took way to long to complete the quests .
this game right here is sooooooooo fun except for the hard mission but they have good people well strong people to send out
this is a fun game that does n't take a lot of thought . you also do n't need to purchase anything if you have a lot of patience .
the best horse game ever ! very realistic , it ` s like i really own this horse ! ! ! ! just wish it was easier to collect diamonds .
absolutely love this game , makes me come back every ten minutes to get my coins lol so awesome ! recommend to everyone !
i am sure if i did not have angry birds on my kindle i would try to spend more time trying to understand the concept but it just bored me .
i can not put this one down ! i love the story and the visuals and the challenge . will look out for more games from this company .
this app has really helped me track our bank accounts , no matter where we are . i have n't even used some of the features it offers yet , but am excited to try them .
i wanted to play it really bad , but it did n't work on my kindle , so i had to delete it .
this is a very boring app and i did not like it the game is much better in person that on the kindle
love this game ! its so much fun and when you are bored it keeps you entertained . its not my favorite game but its one of my favorite .
this app is really organized and will help you to take care of your device memory space so if you want to keep your device working properly you need this app .
did n't work out for me , that 's all really . good app , just not for me ya know . decent though , i suppose
its got pretty great graphics and it does n't take up much space at all . gameplay is pretty smooth and i had no problems with the download .
does not work on my lg optimus . sucks because i was really looking forward to this game . so very disappointing .
most of these games are hard to see where or what you need to do next this one has been very clear and easy to advance through .
a entertaining and relaxing game . first day playing still trying to understand game . i hope it continues to keep my interest .
i like the game but i do n't like all the lag that happens once in a while otherwise i really just enjoy playing the game .
very fun and easy to play . i really enjoy the farming portion of the game ! my kids love it as well great pass time game .
it is sometime too hard to determine what answer they want i prefer several other of the word games which i have purchased
i used this for about 30 seconds before i just decided to use my laptop . clunky and confusing to use .
this app is easy to use and very helpful i check it every morning so i can plan my day .
i do n't use evernote much on my computer but the app for the kindle is great ! i can keep everything organized !
this game seems very simple and kind of boring . it would probably be better for a child . i should have looked at it closer before downloading it .
this app is very slow , this app has a freezing problem , this app does not open properly , when opened it will only scroll up and down but not to the side
i like all types of mahjong games and this one is fun with cats . works fine and i like to keep trying to better my score all the time .
this game is full of fairies and mystery is my case . i like this game ... but i would n't buy it if you do n't like & quot ; finding & quot ; things .
and freezing my kindle fire so that i have to do a complete reset . it 's more frustrating than it is fun .
this game is great for days that i get bored . its its nicely priced and fun for on the go .
i am a big fan of movies . this app puts my knowledge to the test . i love it and you will too .
it is awesome there are many upgrades and weapons to get . very entertaining i have had it for a while and i still play it . i recommend that you get this game .
this is a very nice set up for a bingo game . really not much more i can say about this game game .
this game is very interesting i enjoy and spend a lot of time playing it . the levels seem to get more difficult to as i play which i love . it has not gotten boring to me .
the game is very addictive ! i really like it for its simplicity ! i used to love garfield cartoons when i was growing up : )
this game is definitely fun . it is really challenging however . not as easy as it looks . test your skills and see how many you know .
great game to pass the time with , yes i would tell a friend , cant stop playing it i love playing this game
loving this app ! glad to have found ! takes a little getting used to but once you get the basics figured out , it does what is advertised to do . works for my needs !
i 'm so glad that they have a sims and its soooo fun to play and i can see all my friends too . and it has a great quality too .
i wanted an app of abc and tried to see if this was the one , but it was n't . i have removed it from my kindle .
not enough scenes before you have to buy ! do not like to write headlines - if you want my opinion , stop making it harder than it should be .
great app . i needed a calculator that i would always have with me and i looked at a lot of them and this was the best that i found . great job .
great radio app . plenty of music to choose from your local stations to something for off and way out . the got it . check it out . i think you 'll like it .
i love this game it is soooooo fun i 'm so addicted to it i cant stop playing it . the minions are so funny .
i wish i could 've waited for the sale . can i get my 1 dollar back ! ? i like the game and all but , i 'm kinda mad now .
virtual city is an awesome game but if u r a beginner , it 's hard . get this game ! u will learn !
with all these great reviews i would 've loved to at least try the game , but it would n't even load for me . it just kept freezing up .
plays perfectly . no freezes or crashes . different and interesting modes of play with great graphics ( kindle fire ) and sound . great value .
its very slow at first but it is a very fun game so i think u should get this app
very easy to use app , makes ordering something on the fly easy , recommended to anyone that uses amazon
you get to play like a kid , making dinosaurs . you get to build a park that 's pretty to you . the game is fast paced enough for adults and is safe for kids .
very fun game . it is perfect for when you have a little time to kill . i have no problems with the ai .
i love the challenges each puzzle presents . i like the idea that it is keeping my older generation mind active . but most of all i just enjoy playing this game .
have installed all logo quizzes on kindel fire - i have gotten my entire family involved with the logo games
this was the first game i got for my kindle fire and i love it ! ! ! ! also the ads are n't bad at all 5 out of 5
i love the puzzles and the thinking it is really good . my parents think it gets your mind thinking a lot
this is a fun game . i do n't really play these kind of games.i would recommend this game to anyone .
played this for awhile . some of it is hard to figure out but it takes some time to catch on . fast action , cool air craft .
this game changes with every turn ... ... ... makes you think . there is no way to plan ahead . it is most challenging . i love it
i tried downloading this game on my kindle fire , but it would n't work ! it would n't even start downloading . i played 99 for it and it is n't downloading . oh well ... ...
this was as enjoyable and challenging as the others by this company . they make the best as far as i am concerned .
i love this game and play it all the time it is very fun and addicting i love survival mode with this game . probably its best feature
this game is fun . i was surprised . i am glad i gave it a try . the moves are easy . and it is very entertaining . so have fun playing .
this application have many features that supposed to have , but it does n't . the alarm works good as well the timer .
i think that this game is fun . it is very hard . the only reason i 'm rating this is because i want to get a free hint .
it fun for little kids from ages 3 - 7. since its fun for little kids i will give this a 5 star review .
i could n't even figure it out on the fire it would n't go to the location that i put in and it was n't as good as other ones
it is for kids i think , very easy , i like it i am a kid at heart . i wish you could go to different levels but not in burger making
this is a great game . lots of fun and just difficult enough to be addictive . no glitches so far . look forward to many great games .
i appreciate having a more accurate picture of how my phone is using its charge and how much charge i have left . i 've installed this app on all my devices .
this game is a lot of fun , and you can start off with a tutorial so you can understand the game before playing . you can play online as well if you so desire ! very addictive !
definitely different so makes it interesting and enjoyable ... . love the crush the gems ! ! ! ! i can keep playing as long as i keep win in and getting free coins , awesome ! ! ! !
i have other bejeweled games and this one does not compare . i thought is was the same but the spelling is different .
on fire , great app , u can watch movies , tv shows etc . and for free ! u can do it without wi fi too
you ca n't do some things on your kindle that you can in your pc . i basically use my kindle so it 's got limited use for me but it does help .
this game keeps me focused , it is difficult to put down . it makes for a great break after working all day . easy to figure out and it also challenged me to work faster !
i like to do crossword puzzles this one is fast and some times can really make you think and i like to do that
this game is fun , but the music gets annoying very quickly . you can turn it down though and just play the game without music .
fun and silly not very accurate sometimes but still cute i show it to everyone who wants to see the new kindle fire .
if it were completely free , it would be a good game , i like what i was able to play . oh well
i really enjoy this game & like the idea that i can play friends on line . the rules are easy to follow also .
it was a fun game while it lasted but i beat the game so fast it is just a waste
enjoyed playing game , good graphics and flow , puzzles were fun with right amount of challenge . look forward to more games like this .
did n't like how it forced me to rate . at least he start you can say later but that only works a certain number of times . graphics are cute . story lines ok
i have this app & amp ; i thought i could vote on it but nothing happens when i try . what am i doing wrong ?
i guess this is made to work on phones and not just android wifi tablets . so it makes it hard to give it any review . i was hoping this would of worked but oh well .
all of their games are so entertaining . love all the extras and how easy it is to get to the function tools . my favorite solitare .
quick and fun . wish you got more free coins for playing . great for people with limited time . i like to help others with the bonus round .
ok i love apps but this app is not the best it works but then it does n't even give the right answer its ok ! ! ! i would suggest it to my close family but no one else
this game was very challenging . it kept my interest and i could n't wait to get to the end . loved the creative story line . ca n't wait for the sequel .
i 'm rather new to this type of game play but am finding i enjoy it . with the help of the strategies book i was finally able to finish .
this is a great game for all ages and it 's a great time killer . i would recommend the paid version as well , it 's not expensive at all .
i like these types of puzzle games . makes me use my brain and figure out what to do next . not to thrilled about having to buy up levels though .
i ca n't stop playing it . i just love the fun of controlling the little people . one thing i dislike is that the people barely make enough money .
i loved the channel and now love the app ... love the show video clips and being able to get breaking news notifications ... good stuff : - )
this game can be a nice way to relax and be mildly challenged at the same time . it can be enjoyed by a wide range of ages .
i am enjoying this game very much . tried the trial app and bought the full app today . worth the money .
this was a fun game for my 4 year old grandkids ; however at times the game would just shut down or the screen would become small . lost interest in this after a few times of that happening .
i did n't like it at all . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
no strategy nothing . you just keep touching the screen in different places and that is it . that s a game ? not in my opinion .
this is an amazing game that everyone will love , young or old . you should buy it , and love it too .
i played for a day and really did n't enjoy the 2 games . i was expecting more choices for games so a bit disappointed with the product .
this game is solo much fun and addiction u want to build and earn stuff it 's solo cool get it it 's really fun and worth your time : )
this is a hard game to play , not user friendly . it would help if there were instruction on how to play
very cool game . nice effects , and generally a fun pass time game . if you like the simpson 's you will love this game . nice job !
love this game . fast download and great that it was free . i have it on my ipod and now on my tablet .
this is the best weather channel app i have used . the information and variety of information is really great for my uses .
awesome game ! cant wait for the sequel . make more games like this one . it is worth it to play this game .
i downloaded these hidden object games because i thought they would be challenging . once you have gone through the game and know where all the hidden objects are it is no longer a challenge . i am not impressed
this game is very fun ! but there was only one problem . kick off was locked and cost money but other than that i would of rated it 5 star !
i got a new kindle fire for christmas and so it is much easier to read facebook with the bigger screen than on my iphone
can keep up with local news and traffic conditions whenever i need to find out why i 'm stuck in traffic
this app is incredible ! it takes your selected interests and searches the web for anything you might like . that includes pics , videos , and more !
this is one of the better & quot ; escape & quot ; games i have played . challenging , but not impossible or ridiculous like some others i have played . nice graphics also .
this might be great for a tablet , but not at all for a phone . it was hard to control even using a droid x with it 's large screen . the controls on it are terrible .
a very great game cant put it down i love it makes my day go buy fast when i 'm at work so r my sims need more friends though
this game was a super life saver on a road trip . my niece was very entertained four hours and now i 'm hooked
i like this star map best . i searched through a lot to find it . also it does not require being online .
ca n't ... stop ... reading ... rage comics . read all the comics ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! great way to pass a few minutes ... . or lose a few hours ...
i love it . mine is this country and the next generation your food open to all those who want the far
i was playing words with friends but was less than satisfied with the pace . scrabble has given me what i was looking for . worth the price and they have added single player by popular demand .
this game is actually kinda fun ! ! ! but it always has to force close and u never get to play so if i 'm u ... . dont get it ! ! ! ! ! ! !
i found this app limited and not that worth the download . if it had more options that would be different .
great translation app i 'd recommend you use this if you want to learn a new language the easy way . worth the 2 minutes of download time
great fun for the whole family . i challenge my kids by giving then seasons and colors to dress them in .
what the h @ ll ? every droid and iphone has the radar function . i will be uninstalling . when we see weatherbug for kindle ? ? ?
fun game challenging and hard to put down . it is great to have new games to play especially on a rainy day
i am so happy to have this app , but we have not been able to use it yet unfortunately . = (
this is actually a pretty fun game . you should all try it . theme park tablet edition rules ! please try this game
great book to use in church . this is one that i was brought up on and nice to have at a my finger tips
well done with some really good sounds . much better than others i have tried . plus free sounds to download online . thanks .
very fun and easy to use ! i 'm not very good with video games but this is not too hard or easy . i recommend it !
keeps you busy and you do n't need neighbors or to spend a bunch of money to play the game . love it !
i love this game . it is fun and as i 'm a beginner i found it had helped me learn how to play better .
this app is a cool way to do status updates on facebook . i like the different cartoons and how you can really make it look like you !
i just downloaded this game and so far i am enjoying it . the puzzle are pretty easy so far but i hope they get more challenging .
i 'm loving the game so far . only finished the first level and it was n't too hard . looking forward to getting more challenging levels . thanks for the free fun .
the whole family loves this game ! closest thing to the real thing ! fun , fun , fun , and more fun ! two thumbs up !
okay . i think it was okay it 's fun to play but hard to beat . you need to work on graphics and performance .
great pictures ! - gets harder with each one ! the first challenge is to figure what animal , and to get the first piece in the right place .
love this game so much fun to play with the kids . we all love it and have fun trying to beat each other .
it is ok to look around on but that is about all i found it useful for if thinking of the right one
my grandchildren love it wish there was a little more to it its just the same recipes over and over
i would recommend this game to people of all ages . provides hours of fun while requiring thinking . allows u to think outside the box !
my baby sister had this game and she loves it she has a lot of fun only one problem it runs a little slow but still a fun game for little ones
not to bad of a game . it fills the the rainy day and does n't take to much effort . recommend for any one who is bored lol
i downloaded this game for my grandson and i started playing it myself . its so addicting and so much fun to play .
it 's a pretty good light for those odd situations where you really need one and do n't have one on you . i like the way you can change the settings .
whatever i do with it , it turns out really cute , so i always enjoy playing this . it 's so neat and anyone of any age could probably enjoy it .
good at guessing but guess sometimes wrong . just did not hold my attention . it is no longer one of my apps .
just the right degree of challenge for a fun and relaxing game . nice graphics and sound effects . i do think the bear is a bit creepy , however .
i have used yahoo mail for a long time and enjoy using it . i know there are other email systems available .
i really like this game . it 's just like the original game . it 's fast pace keeps you on your toes for the full two minutes .
this game is over quick and difficult to figure out . at this point i am not sure if i like it or not .
not easy to figure out how to play or what each level is about . there is not enough different things to do with .
i loved this game . it is very creative ! but too short . i wish there were more levels in this game .
it lets you know how much time if left before you need to charge it and it tells you how much time for games , videos etc - really good - a must have app
pretty good . not my favorite , but good . useful when i 'm bored . it 's fun and easy , and its always challenging you .
i just got this game but i 'm really enjoying it . you can win chips and power ups easily . i would recommend this game
just really did n't care for this game . it does have a great concept but i could n't get into it . just was n't for me
this a fun game and as you go along , more challenging . i need something to challenge me occasionally . love it ! ! ! !
this is one of the best games i ever played ! one problem , it should be easier to get gems . over all , it 's a great game .
i thought that this is one of the best calculator apps i have ever come across . a must get for every one ! ! ! !
best game ever , i love the walk through right on the screen , ready to use when you need the help ;
great game . but too many foreign logos . and not enough hints when you guess correct answers . still worth getting this app
i love to play this game with the kids . some are easy , some require a little more thought . great way to pass the time .
have 5 bingo games , this is 2nd favorite . seems to always have a surprise . extra games here and there . power ups .
saw everyone using this app on social media and i got curious have n't used it yet but will soon enough .
this is my second time playing this game great graphics . only thing i wish was that the words were larger in the hidden objects areas .
about time there was an edition made for kindle ! makes the addiction so much easier since i do n't have an iphone !
just started playing but a fun game to pass the time . good graphics . kids have fun playing the game too
poor for those who are not good with word games . if your strong with crosswords then here you go . your game .
downloaded based on recommendation from zoo story . not fun , nor entertaining . this app is far worth the money or your time .
it 's a fun game to but but sometimes the game cuts off and does n't let you back in so you lose the coins for that game
entertaining game to play . can earn a daily prize . check it out if you love bongo you will love this game .
i didnt think this app would be all that great when i first downloaded it but its really great and extremely addicting ! love it : )
i love this app a lot . my hubby and i both play and love trying to out do each others city .
thank you for adding candy crush to kindle ! ! ! one of my favorite games ! way to keep up with the & quot ; others & quot ;
was nicely surprised at the game . a bit different than the same ole match three games . the graphics are cute . i recommend this one for all ages !
i usually like to play a card game to unwind before i go to bed and this is great . i loved playing this game with family so it 's been nice to play again .
these types of games are a good way to pass the time on cold nights and lazy week ends in winter
while there are many other uses : daily readings , prayers , etc . for those on the go it is sooo very helpful !
it was impossible to get from one opening to another , going very fast and with a very short amount of time .
this is the only app of 4 i tried to download to my kindle fire hd that actually downloaded and installed . now i can watch my stuff from anywhere . i 'm very excited about this .
wasnt wat i thought it was . n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n

its a pretty cool game just do n't like that you have to pay to play more but other then that i like it .
i love playing this game , it is challenging and great to play . sometimes , the computer makes , i feel , the wrong card to play . however , that is half the fun playing .
game has bugs that are not allowing me to store items and move on . i have checked with online resources and know that i am doing it correctly . finally had to quit after trying 3 times .
i liked the first game but i enjoyed playing this one more . it was more straight forward in a way .
i do n't have time to watch the weather so this is nice to have so i know what the weather will be .
this game is really fun and works your brain . the levels are mostly easy but you may have to do a few a couple of times to get it done .
just enough levels . fun . cool . addictive . i love this app . the best thing about it is that its free . no good apps are free . but this one is ... ..
fun fun fun fun fun fun fun ! trust me ! if it 's updated it will only get better one of the best of this genre !
i downloaded this game because i spent endless hours playing pac-man when it first came out . since i did n't have a joy stick , it was much more of a challenge .

great way to kill some time while waiting for an appointment or your kids lesson to end . fun for all ages .
waste of my time . i know it was just for fun but i did n't have any using this app . took long time to down load
this app wo n't even install on my kindle . it is not worth it . from reading all the other reviews , it is obviously has lots of problems .
my 7 yr old grand daughter loves it . she is better at it then me . makes them think ahead . planning and logic . stop and think what there actions will cause .
i ca n't tell that it has made my tablet faster but it is easy to use and seems to work as advertised .
clean and easy to win i like the lack of a lot of bells and whistles a nice game to play when you run out of points on the other games
my son loves this show that 's why i got the app . and the app is perfect for learning toddlers . there is even a little racing game with bubble puppy .
i have been waiting for it to come out ! ! it is so much fun ! ! i am so glad amazon put it on app store ! !
my son downloaded this app and is definitely pleased with it . he uses it all the time and has no complaints !
awesome game i think i like this because it makes me feel not bored . i also like it because it is a challenging game .
this game is alright . i personally think that there should be no extra letters that u r not going to use . but , other than that , it is good .
i love my horse . i think it is really good because you do not have to spend money . i also like it because my friend plays it as well .
it is really fun . i highly recommend it . it is worth the download . get this app for a good time
i can not even bring this up anymore . also stuck on floor 30 and guide not helping me at all help
i downloaded this game and never played it . it was not what i was expecting , so i uninstalled the app .
fun for the first couple levels then i got bored of it . didnt get any different really just searching for things in the same way level after level .
really enjoy this bingo game . offers a good amount of free bingo bucks to keep you in play . cute music and sound effects too !
this is not the app you want to use for the kindle fire . download the other task killer with the red x. also free , more features .
daughter loves it ~ plays it on her new nook all the time glad it was free for her to get
this game just seems dull and not quite as exciting as some of the tetris games i 've played in the past .
love it ! ! simple and fun ! excellent way to pass the time and enjoy the use of single and 2nd player !
this game is hard using my kindle fire it is not fun do not like it at all do not get this ! !
i like playing this bingo . i would have given it 5 stars if it was easier to get keys and power plays without spending cash . seems to take forever to save up when playing without them .
i like this game easy to figure out , i have it on my kindle wish it would convert to my screen very small to read other than that it fun to play .
bingo beach is a fun bingo game . it helps me kill time during the day . it 's a very enjoyable game .
im nine and i love this game it never freezes like other games and does not have a glitch ! it works great for my kindle ! : ) ) )
fun resource management game . social with other players is built in with neighbors quests and such . worth the download for free .

this is extremely funny and have had lots of fun with this ! i 'd highly recommend this to everyone ! good one !
i really enjoy this game . it helps with eye hand coordination and memory , but there should be another way to earn stars . the process is two slow .
i love the sims i have it for my kindle my ipad my xbox and computer and i love every angle one of them i think you will like it alot
this one was just ok. did n't seem to have to many levels and i got through them pretty quick . its the kind of thing i like to figure out but it needs more levels .
videos were good in sound but terrible in picture . the music videos kept on freezing and sometimes it would stop , so i deleted it off my device .
ok for a while had to uninstall because it took up to much storage in my tablet . would download again
slots of fun great bonus games and different levels they do have coins for purchase but not needed try it you 'll like it
did n't always shoot where i wanted it to . annoying , so i uninstalled . if you can work around the problem then you will like the app .
this is so much fun for kids and adults alike . i can easily kill an hour or two ... . or keep my kids busy for a while !
it worked fine on my kindle fire but i used up all the free levels in 15 minutes . i wo n't be buying it for $ 4 though .
i just purchased this game and so far i am enjoying it a lot . i think this is a great game for all ages so we would all enjoy it .
i did not like this game too much . it was difficult to start . i did not like the time factor for the game .
i did not keep this one for very long . perhaps i am not the puzzle sort but other than that , the graphics were okay .
this is a great game . you will not be disappointed with it . nice graphics and pictures . starts out fairly easy .
bought this for my 4 and 2 year old . just what you expect . i got it free . i could n't see paying for a memory game .
its a cute game it reminds me of hotel city on fb ive only been playing for a short time but so far its enjoyable dont have any complaints yet .
good game overall . wish it was ad free . would be willing to pay for that . would love to be able to change the designs on the deck as well .
i love how i can build my city the way i like it . if there is new stuff in the game . i just ca n't wait to see it .
it will not even load do not get this app it really sucks and it crashes itself do not get this
a very good mystery game . very addicting and fun to play . i recommend this game to anyone who likes hidden object games .
really cute game i bet kids would love it . i really like the animal sounds when you get a match .
this is so far a very entertaining game . i like a game that i can go at my own pace , perfect . also it 's not frustrating like some other games i have played .
i like this app but if it had a different patient u can do and different situations then the app will get five stars but until then it deserves three
not a great app , should be free . why have a camera in the kindle if you need to pay for an app ?
did n't like it . do n't bother w this game cuz it is not worth the effort of writing all the required words .
awesome game love the entire thing u would love it if u were to be in a great mood like i always am
got it for the grandchild and he is n't really old enough yet . i like it fine though . not an artist and makes me feel like i might be able to be one : )
this is a fun game . it is challenging , yet gives you hints on little known brands that can really stump you
a very addicting game with increasing difficulty levels but not so difficult that you get stuck and have to stop . i play this game most every night .
this game is not bad . there are a lot of fun games . the only problem is the time it takes to get the games
this version has many languages to it . i am finding it had to set up an account with this version .
i absolutely love this game . some of the levels are pretty hard . but very challenging ... love to play any bubble games . i like that it 's challenging .
this is the best escape game ever ! it is so entertaining and challenging at the same time , most are too hard and boring , not this one !
i ca n't put this down . a game that keeps you thinking and busy for hours . good for long road trips or doctor office or just any long waits .
i love this game . it has hidden objects plus a good mystery story . also finally a hint option that actually gives you the hints you need . hope to see more games like this .
im sure that this is a fun and entertaining game , but i wouldnt know . i bought the game , but it wouldnt download so i really had no choice but to give it 1 star .
amusing game , keeps me entertained for a while , and works for the kids too . not to hard to play !
simple calculator with big buttons and easy to use . my go to calculator on my kindle fire . what else can you ask for ?
this game is great i play it with friends and family . its very addictive ad i love it very much . !
fruit devil is a really fun game but there is the word devil in it and if you do n't want your kid playing a game like that then i suggest not to download it .
nice game holds my interest . i wish the pieces were a little larger and easier to see . all in all , it 's okay .
never gon na be like temple run or anything but it 's okay but wish you could get coins though the game instead of at certain parts
these crosswords are so habit forming that i have to play at least once a day . great way to stimulate the brain and start the day .
it does n't give me all that need so i do n't use it as much . i still have to go online
this game is ok but i have played better ones . it keeps my mind occupied as well as giving me something to do .
this is an ok game . it gets boring pretty quick . you do n't get to choose categories , you have to search what it gives you .
i like having this on my kindle fire hd tablet so i have something to occupy my mind on the go .
keeps you interested to keep playing , and just busy enough to get you really involved in the game enjoy it its fun . the different levels and speed of the game are great
i cant get this set up to work , maybe its me that is the problem . this app i have never been able to use yet .
not a bad game , enough coins to keep you busy for awhile . fun bonus games . cool graphics . download it , you wo n't be sorry .
it get 's stuck on the last step of level 11 , ca n't complain i got it free . i do n't think i would waste money to buy it though
game was challenging at first but quickly became boring . luckily i downloaded the game for free as the amazon download of the day .
did n't see why the need for the plug in . it just was n't enough to make me give up the messenger . not impressed at all .
i was honestly impressed with this game . i recommend it . the layout was well thought out . the map feature that shows you areas where you have an open task is brilliant .
the only downfall to this game i have found is that you have to spend gold coins to open the high levels . other than that , it 's a fun and addicting game .
great family entertainment ! graphics are just amazing and the sound of the ice breaking outstanding . the music can become boring after a while but you can always lower the volume a bit .
it is nice to finally have security that was needed for the kindle . it appears to scan each time the kindle is turned on .
i 'm beginning to like this game a lot . graphics are really cool . i will recommend this game when you have time to waste and the time will fly by .
another great app for all of us slot lovers that do n't want to spend money . nice going : ) thank you to the developer !
i love tetris and this app provides a great platform for anyone who enjoys the game . once you get used to playing on your kindle - you 'll love it .
i think it is fun because there are lots of things to do on this app i enjoyed it ! you should download this app !
this game is epic and super addicting but the coins should n't be so expensive . they are pretty easy to get so there 's really no point in buying them anyway . still a must buy , though
this game is really fun and addicting . i have played this on my computer and was happy to see it available for my kindle . this game is fun for all ages . have fun playing it .
so far , i have been able to download every song i have wanted in english and spanish . very easy to use . love it .
little grandson likes to play this likes the animals and sits for a while and plays likes the numbers with it
good game . its very fast paced so you have to keep on your game ! i havent made it yet , but i keep trying . i recommend it , keeps you mind working !
it is a fun game but sometimes it can get aggravating . i would never buy coins for this or any other game and would not recommend any one else to waist there money on it .
this game will keep you entertained for quite a while . i would recommend it to almost anyone . it gets harder the longer you play .
basically you keep tapping cookies then you can buy upgrades to get cookies faster . this game will literally eat up your time .
ok so to match and get high score you need to keep looking and matching thinking of the next match if you want to get a really high score for three stars
its fun to kill a few minutes here and there , but it lags sometimes . it needs to be a lot more fluid . still fun though .
this is a very entertaining game . the levels are very difficult to complete with a star , however , you still pass the level without it . city building meets time management . very fun .
if you enjoy just having fun and playing something that 's catchy this is your game . i enjoy the levels and working towards getting the best score .
i really like it though i wish there was more levels but worth the $ 0.99 you should get it if you have a dollar
you certainly get your money 's worth with this game . great graphics and story . i play these ho games all the time , this one was one of the best ever !
excellent puzzle ... only problem , it was completed in only a few hours . ca n't wait for more apps like this one .
i have to rate to unlock a feature i have to rate to unlock a feature i have to rate to unlock a feature
fun to play as and very engaging for the mind . keeps your mind working while having fun . made me use a different part of my brain to figure out the puzzles .
i just used it once to see how it worked . unless you are at a good wireless site that can be used for the length of the item you are viewing not good since you loose the signal .
love the bonus games . like the way each game is a little different from the last . easy to earn more games too . just keep playing and i like to do that !
this was slow and laggy on my device , after all the updates it has gotten better . seems to work alright .
it works on my htc evo 4g and love it . the only thing i would like to see is the ability to print from my mail app other than just gmail . then it would be 5 stars !
it worked great at first , but now it 's not working on my kindle . have n't had time to figure out what 's wrong with it . if it worked , it would be great .
match three fruits is a lot of fun . you can play for hours at a time . good game for the doctor office .
really good content , easy to use . meets all my needs , keeps me updated on what is important to me without the typical media spin .
i am golf fanatic , and there is nothing more that to have one of your favorite magazines with you on your tablet or any other magazine , no paper . nice .
unable to start game , force closes on start up . tried reboot but no success , same with doing a reinstall . good thing it was free at least .
this is he was a great game you should play because my mom told me to get good games so . get it
same as the other fb hopefully time will fix it will try again another day and hope its fixed , i love fb
it used to be my favorite in the world but now , when i try to open it it just crashes .
if you are using the free version it is too short . just when i was getting to it , it was over , maybe the paid version is better
good love it ! ! ! ! it is so addictive i could play it all day ! ! ! i got the free one so but i would not buy if i. had to pay . : /
the game is very challenging . and difficult at times . i spent a lot of time on one level and could not pass it . i lost patience . but it is a pretty good game .
this game is addicting to play . can be easy at times and hard at other times . love this game ! ! ! love this game
love this game ! calm your nerves for sure ! lol got stuck on some levels , but than came back and passed those as well : ) can play it all over again !
it gives you the same 4 animals but it is cute i bought the free version i think that 's why !
definately a game i could play over and over . would highly recommend to a friend . get this app today & hellip ; you wont be disappointed
i do like the game it is fun , but the power plays are far and very little won . i wish you had a way to win more . at least a chance to win .
my 2 yr old daughter seems to like this game . she , however , finds the animals rather quickly . in result , it may not stay on her top 3 favorite game list .
fun fun fun . i love it . great way to pass the time . i love to be able to have so many things to throw and so many fun settings .
i received this from a free amazon offer . it is addicting . i have received lots of questions about the game when i travel .
not what i thought it was . just like the previous rating . should be more to it and less of the advertising
i really really like this dice game . you can play with anyone or your friends . it is fast paced and easy to play . i could sit and play it all day .
the videos show the line that they are loaded but it suddenly stops so i have to pause and then play it and then do it all over again every 3 seconds
when i first saw the free app for this game was n't sure what it was but decided to try it anyway and just see if i would like it or not
fun game . very realistic . the thing i do not like is it is too difficult to find out how to start the game .
what is there to say ? it 's a challenging game . fast moving and easy to navigate . free is always good , too .
i love this game works good on kindle fire and everything best i just ca n't stop loving this app : ) worth the money you pay trust me ! ! !
this game is really entertaining and enjoyable worth the 2 bucks definitely go ahead and buy it its also a good time waster
i love this game . it 's fun and challenging . makes you work to find hidden objects which is why i like the game . it 's unique .
omg ! ! ! i played this game nonlinear but now its on my kindle and its even better ! ! ! i recommend . this for everyone of all ages ! ! ! ! ! ! xd
i love it , very addicting . very colorful . great value for the price . will be playing this for a long time .
i have only been playing this game for a few hands but it is very fun so far . fun , fun .
well ... ... good concept . would be better if there were more free songs to choose from . easy way to waste money . ca n't recommend it .
this really works the other side of my brain . it makes you think about all of the possible choices . i found it fun .
i was surprised they had the star wars theme playing on the game . angry birds , what ever version , is always a lot of fun . i do enjoy hearing the music as well .
hard to use . my finger would n't pick up the words right and it was frustrating to try using this game .
i really like this app for android devices . this is definitely one of the best free ones out there . my only complaint would be that you can not easily add or delete locations .
this sequel was great , all my friends like it so i decided to try , and loved it too . just fun
quick and simple , but entertaining enough . a good entry level for this genre and the graphics are nice . best of all , there are no ads or permissions ! enjoy !
warning ! ! this game is very addicting ! ! ! ! great shooter . incredible graphics . multiplayer . what more do you need ? love this game . would be 100 stars if i could .
not enough to do the game with it seemed like a good idea but it 's hard to level your kindle .
i deleted this game after the first day ... it is hard to see some of the objects ... and on each screen you were looking for the same objects ... no wonder it was free ...
it is a great free app would not pay the 4.99 for it . lots of fun my 8 year old son loves to play it !
i really do like this app . nice to know what is up with the weather at all times so easier to make any plans .
on the kindle it does n't freeze up and it is really fun . i love playing it and it kills time . love the game it is awesome .
i watch it all the time with my dad and i 'm a girl but i love even im a girl
this game was recommended to me by my kids . boy it is fast pace , now my husband and i play it on our devices and we are even in competition ... i am winning of course .
it is so fun and i can never stop playing it is so much fun so that 's why i gave it five stars
game turned out to be more fun than expected . fun for the kids too highly recommended . can also upgrade with money
i like this app . the news is up to the minute so you stay informed . it also has video and stuff to read . i recommend this app .
i love keeping in touch with friends and family . it 's entertaining . i love the picture and videos . i would recommend it to everyone .
even the ads rock 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 . 15 16
i love this game its so addictive and i just cant stop playing everyone will love this game very much . : ) . its soo fun ... ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
once you realize a blank is used for a dash it is all fun and games . know your brand names !
i enjoy playing this game but it is slow and often freezes up my kindle . i like that their are challenges other than letter score .
love it best game ever in the world love in it ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya
this is a good app . it 's a great test to see how you know your bible . it 's also a learning tool to help you know the bible . very fun .
i love that i can play the machine and there are different levels . great graphics . it 's easy to open and shut down . good game .
could not get past the directions . obviously i am not smart enough . very sad . i like math games usually . i may have enjoyed this one .
i am enjoying the pandora app very much because i like listening to music with out interruptions . pandora has many music choices that i enjoy and i can listen on my kindle anywhere .
i could n't ever get my plane to fly . it would always crash . i just could n't get any of the controls to work .
i love this game . the bonus games are great . i also like that it gives me extra opportunities to win coins .
this is my favorite kind of game , i like skill of shooting down the various colors and seeing if i can beat the game . it keeps me working hard .
simply put , amazing . rio works great and looks great on my droid x. thanks angry birds and rio . and we even get to know when the next levels will be available ... awesome awesome , awesome .
this game was not the same game i thought i was getting -- but i play it occasionally . i am getting used to it .
love this game . works wonderful on my kindle fire . easy to lose track of time playing this game . love getting the puzzle pieces !
this has to be one of the better free games out there . i had it on my droid , but it is even better on my kindle .
i am finding it difficult to get rid of bubbles because i just ca n't seem to go beyond the first screen to get to the top . enjoyable but frustrating .
i love this game ! slowly but surely i 'm getting better with each game , and making new friends along the way . recommend to all
not for people with poor vision . i have difficulty seeing a lot of the objects even after i am shown them , but still a great game .
story holds your interest graphics are decent and puzzle challenges range from easy to difficult enough to hold your interest . i would recommend to anyone that likes this type of game .
kicks my butt so it is n't much fun . the reaction time of my kindle fire hd makes it hard to use .
l played this slot for hours and its better than almost all the rest . i give it a very good score .
funniest games there is ! ! ! it ever pays you to play ! ! ! ! it is really a great game ! and i hope this review is helpful
this is very cute ! ! ! great graphics , neat little game . i do n't normally write reviews but felt i needed to because this is a neat little game .
enough said , very disappointed , useless game , wasted the time to download and now ca n't figure out how to get it off my nexus .
it was so boring do not get this app because all u do is just fix her hair and do all that but it is boring
i had the old version of this app . there have been a lot of awesome improvements ! even tho i got the free day one , i 'd still but it !
my friends and i are using this app and have found it very useful . it 's easy to work with , too .
great game but a little bit too easy . ca n't wait for the update . got as far as i could in little over 2 hours
the story line is different which is a nice change . i am looking forward to the next one . my only complaint is i wish it was longer !
this app is entirely fake . it 's definitely not worth 99 cents or 99 coins . do n't get this app ! ! ! really it 's horrible .
this is another game that gets me going the more i find a word the more i want to play
i really enjoy this slots game . i could spend hours playing . reminds me of one of my favorite machines in las vegas .
i was looking for candy crush on amazon , but this was the closest one i could find . i do enjoy it occasionally .
great app love this app i think this app is a great app to have . you should really great app . i recommend this app to others
every time i play this i lose way more than win . complete waste of time and space to play this game ! ! ! !
there are no directions which makes it hard to play . hints require in app purchases . glad it was free . i would be very disappointed if i paid for this .
i really like this app . the backgrounds make this more interesting and exciting . the background music is calming and peaceful and the tiles are beautiful .
this game is fun , addicting , and challenging ! i ca n't wait to get back to playing the game . love this app !
no game instructions . what is zuma ? no fun not knowing how to play . all apps include a how to play .
this is my 4 year old granddaughter 's favorite app to play with . i wish it did more but she seems content with it .
in this awesome racing app you can pick your car and get to the tracks . this amazing app surprised me so much that i ca n't stop playing it !
this game is one of the best i have ever played . incredibly fun , challenging without being overly difficult . ca n't wait for more !
i really enjoy the stories and it is easy to follow . it is just like being on line at my computer .
quite an interesting game . as with the others , not sure about the physics . but the developers do need to explain the changes in the updates . that 's just good practice .
i was searching for an app because i was going on a 20 hour car ride and nothing seemed right i woo found this game and it is incredibly fun and i will never delete it .
the game is awesome and fun to play but it is hard to unlock new weapons . most of them will take more than a straight month to unlock them .
i agree with everyone else . i ca n't see recent posts . i am removing it from my device . i am in search of a replacement app .
i used this and loved it for about 2 weeks then i got bored doing the same things every day and never really noticed much improvement . might be my slow brain but it was fun while it lasted .
i 'm not totally sure how this game works , so far , but i enjoy playing the game and see how much points i can get .
best mahjong out there . i hope they hurry and make some new updates . best graphics , sounds , play . some are so complex where it 's unnecessary .
this game rates about third on the list of games offered as reward in my day care . the older children say it helps them with their spelling tests .
my daughter told me about this because we played it a lot when she was younger so i downloaded it on my smart phone and kindle fire .
addictive ! even my 2 yr old and 8 yr old love it ! ! ! fun times to be had by all ! love it !
it is so stupid all you do is toss birds so bad . p.s . all you guys the space one is awesome get angry birds space a lot better .
this is a great driving game . the only thing i do n't like about it is that gold is hard to get without using real money overall its a good game you should get it .
get this game it is so worth it at first it might lag but then it wont i enjoyed every little bit of this game : )

got this for kindle fire hd . it is fun to play . the graphics are great . the puzzles varied in difficulty . it runs well . i have no complaints .
this is not a bad game . i played it and could not stopped . i am a hidden object freak . but they have to have a story and or mystery to them and this has both .

not really as entertaining as i thought it would be when i tried it . it is ok but not something that makes me want to keep playing

this app used to be great . now they changed to where you have to spend money . they took away free things .

this is the best bingo by far . easy to win and the rewards are awesome . i have n't played long enough to rate the bonuses and power up yet .

it would be great for older children to play with because it is very fast paced but it has a good concept just not good for my 4 year old daughter .
i like it very much . i have just started to play games and this one i will keep on my kindle and iphone .
it is a fun game . it does take a while to get started but still fun . i recommend it for kids and younger adults . after starting it will get better .

now it was so much fun i wanted it on my kindle fire hd and it is just as much fun on it as it was on computer
a new approach to the match 3 genre . great graphics and challenging levels . unique powerups . this could become addictive if it were n't for the 5 lives limit .
a great way to pass time . the ads are annoying , but it is a free app , and you can purchase the app if they really bother you .
i really enjoyed playing this game . i would love more games like this . beautiful story and excellent games . hope to see many more like it .
this game is awesome , it 's so addicting once you get started , i learned , do n't be scared to use a lot of your stuff , it ends up great , get it
i like the game , but you are pretty much stuck playing several hours or days to get upgrades if you do n't want to pay . i did not try the multiplayer option .
gave it a 5 star for music , relaxing , and ease of play . also enjoying the 3 play modes . great way to pass some time .
thought i would like this site . the games just dont get me interested enough to stay connected . maybe it will be fun for some .
it is a very good game i like it it can be very challenging at some times but then very easy
love the game keeps me interested . thought it would be too easy , but it definitely is hard enough to keep you playing the game .
nice game . challenging but easy to play . game to play when time is limited . games are short if you know the answers

i do n't understand it at all it seems to easy ... .. do n't buy it , it is stupid ! ! i regret buying this .
just like the original . i played a few rounds by myself and liked it showing the different scoring options . i would like to be able to play against the computer as an option .
i love how you can actually take care of it like its real i highly recommend this game like i said its amazing i love and you will too and its free
great graphics . i particularly like the hints feature . it 's very helpful and visually attractive . a good game for anyone . worth the money .
a good game for no brain . little thought needed . would be great if your child can not use the real thing . and never wanted to .
i love the fact that you do n't get stuck if you do n't buy gems ! you can breed monsters to get the ones you want and they 're adorable ! i love this game !
this app is a great learning tool . i play my fb friends daily and most of them get more than double my score !
i am rating this higher because i am pretty sure it is better than the rating it currently has . it runs fine on vibrant . it seems like a decent game that is worth a buck .
i like this game totally and completely . you will also . and its much better than the older version so enjoy and pass it on
it was too short and i could n't even try out more than a couple things . the demo ends after the first day and i was just disappointed . : /

i love this product and have one for every room in the house . this product is great for streaming everything . i especially love the ease and navigation of this product .
i recently downloaded this game and have really enjoyed playing it . this game has really held my interest and i do n't think i will get tired of this game .
this is fun . i play it myself even though it 's for kids . it has various levels of difficulty , which is nice .
this game did not hold my interest at all . i would rather just stick with the hidden object games which are more entertaining .
i already enjoy this game on my big kindle in black . & amp ; white , so it will be even better in color !
very creative game challenging . i would love to see a sequel for it . i liked the way they did the hidden object parts of the game .
this game is so much fun . it can keep you occupied for hours . you have to use some brain power if you 're trying to get to the higher levels .
i enjoy this game . i love hidden objects , and this one is pretty good . i like looking for hidden things .
this is a pretty good game so far . the graphics are pretty clear and so far not too tough . like it !
i looks to play a game several times before making a final decision . this appears that it will be a winner .
not worth my time when i found facebook works great without having to put it just for tablet when it gives nothing more
fun to play . download it and start playing . have fun . relaxing and easy to play . begin playing and see for yourself .
love this slot game - gives me hours of entertainment trying to get that & # 34 ; wheel spin & # 34 ; always fun - never disappointing !
i love this game , had one similar to it in a hand held game , the bonuses are great . if you like slots , you 'll like this .
possibly a few thing i might could change , but those would not keep me from paying for this game to support the company .
this game gave me everything i was hoping for shows you how to play awesome theme songs to tv shows and more great game definitely worth the money one of my best games
this is a game that my children play . they seem to really enjoy it and it seems to work very well for them . i would recommend it to others .

my 15 year old needs entertainment and free is ok by me . decent game and no cost is a good deal for everyone .
talk about some cool wallpaper this is it . love , love this for my samsung tab 7. there are hundreds of different wallpaper that you can choose from . love it ...

this game is very easy , but is also fun . i can figure out the answer to the problem in about 1 second .
i like the game . levels get more difficult as you go but not hard . i started with free version but upgraded to the paid version which has more levels . well worth the money .

love this game . advance player of seek and finds and this game really makes me think out of the box .
a great game added to my tablet . hours of fun to enjoy and it helps that it was free to download

it 's good for video or minecraft lovers like myself but i wish that when you buy it they come unlocked
what can be said except fun . it is a fun and quite game which will keep you entertained . get it .

downloaded this onto my kindle for my grandson and he plays until the battery runs down . additive ! better than the free version .
this game is awesome . you should definitely buy this game . you would have to be an idiot not to buy it
this is a very pretty , scary , fun game . i am enjoying playing it . the only problem i have with it is that sometimes the items are too small to see .
love this game , can play whenever i want to and do n't need anyone home to play ! i always look forward to my next turn .
it is okay , but not a really good substitute for minecraft . if you are looking for minecraft , pay the cost .
very cute game that moves fast enough to keep the player interested . keeps player interested with new features and adventures .

good graphics and entertaining . just wish money did n't go so fast . payouts should be larger . overall i enjoy playing to pass the time .
this game is really fun to play because you feel like you 're really working in a hotel . i also like that there is different themes . the themes are very creative .
great app that lets you pick your own radio station to listen to . there is a wide variety of stations available
does what i need it to do . i love the big screen and buttons . very handy and it 's a quick start up .
pac man is one of my favorite games growing up so this is totally perfect for me . my children love it too .

if you watch a lot of tv then get this fun app because it will keep you guessing so get it .

entertaining . i do n't know how far i can get before it asks for money to continue , but its fun right now ...
if you have never heard of candy crush their us something seriously wrong with you . this version plays very well on the kindle . very pleased ! !
this product is really good . especially on my kindle . one problem is that it does take quite a while to load up . other than that its a great download .
i really like this one there are lots of choices to calm your mind and relax good music and sounds .
this game downloaded quickly to my kindle . i 'm so addicted already . get ready for hours of fun and excitement with this one .
to much to do to get it to load , had to call support and decided that downloading so many apps was not worth the effort .
i really enjoy playing this game ! i recommend playing it ! i first played this game on my computer and now i play it on my kindle .
this is one of the best bingo games out there . i just love it.i would recommend this game to anybody ; and the best thing its free .
it is okay . i am not very lucky . but is fun to play . i like the word games better . fun
very nice graphics and game play had a lot of fun playing it . much better than other games i 've tried
wanted a game to be able to play while on the road and this is it ! my kids love it too .
lots of the levels are really hard . though it is kind of fun . you should n't buy this if you 're not looking for a challenge .
i am only on level 3. so far it 's fun ! village is small but growing . hope to get past this quickly . @
i got totally addicted to this game even though i 'm not that good at it . it was totally worth the couple of seconds i had to wait
i liked this a lot . i do n't consider myself an idiot ( thanks , mom ! ) and i found the puzzles challenging . give me more like this .
nice app for the novice user . i do n't know all there is to know about twitter , but it works for everything i need it for .
my grand daughter plays this game . i guess she really likes it or she would n't play it more then 5 minutes
i get people who leave messages but no dates . they are either not interested or i 'm not interested or too far away
this was pretty easy . i did give it four stars ; but i wish that the house had more rooms to & # 34 ; look & # 34 ; through .
but you can play it without having to wait on your friends to take their turn ! ! also it 's a one player game .
some of the puzzles were challenging , but i was disappointed with how short the game was . i think it would be fantastic if it were longer and the end was n't such a let down .
endless entertainment , husband plays daily at lunch . i play in the evening , seems like you never play the same game twice .
i do n't know why ... the app did n't seem very user-friendly . i have it on my kindle but rarely use it .
it was easy and fun and challenging . nice to past the time away . easy to navigate . i 'm no expert , but i enjoyed it .
this game is addictive . i did n't think it would be this fun to play , but i love it . it 's easy to learn the controls and game play is fairly easy .
it 's nice to have a calculator handy at all times . it is right there at your fingertips when needed . works great
not a fan of that software . so i 'm rating it 1 star for that . if open feint was removed this would be a 4 star game .
does anyone know where the crosswords and other games can be found ? other than that it seems a good value .
this is a lot of fun . at first i thought it would be too easy , but the difficulty increases as you go .
this is a good game . it really works the memory . i am enjoying i very much . i have not had any problems with it on the kindle fire .
this was not at all what i thought . i removed this app quickly after downloading it . it is just not fun .
the facebook application downloaded fine and works with no problem . speed is fine and have seen no errors . thank you . : )
abc def g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y and z
it was okay its just an ap . i really not sure what to say about it . i need it for my kindle .
i love this game it 's just like scrabble , and its a great brain game that makes you think and grow .
great game very addictive love playing keeps you entertained for awhile love love love love love love love love love
such an easy and fun way to pass the time . all th animals are cute ! and the game is so easy to play , easy enough to level up that it never gets boring !
i bought this game the day i got my kindle played daily . the update ruined the game completely . so small it is pointless .
i enjoy playing this game . could get hooked on it but i ca n't get past all the buying other tokens or stars
i love this game ! it is my favorite game ever and it is so much fun ! this is without a doubt the best game ever made and it is totally worth the wait .
this app is really great . the puzzles get more difficult as the progress . he has learned how shapes fit together .
this is the best weather app anyone could ever have ! it works great on my kindle fire and cell phone !
fun game as all of the rest of the angry bird games . really like the star wars characters . will have to get the next one .
fun game that sucks you in because you want to keep beating your score . easy to learn and play . addictive .
i have never played this game but my husband seems to like it . he has it on his kindle fire
the quality of the picture was blurry , but other than that it was funny . too bad you could n't adjust the sizes of the faces though
maybe i did n't give it much of a chance but my initial experience was poor . i uninstalled it almost immediately rather than deal with it .
this is a cute little app . my complaint is that it is too hard to obtain diamonds . you must buy them to keep the game moving .
challenges your mind . makes yourself think and make mental thoughts of what the logo could be . very hard and although i suck at it its cool and exciting also fun

fun and relaxing . love the different challenges . it would be nice to have more lives , or to take less time to receive new lives .
it ok i mean i hate that you cant go to the next level until you get s certain amount . but otherwise its alright
this app stops on a regular basis and it is frustrating when i am in the middle of a game .
extremely good app and must have app for every kindle user . easy to use and with nice interface . definitely an app to have .
i would rate this 5 stars if it had n't keep asking me to go on facebook . other than that , it 's fine . have fun .
the game is nothing special . amusing for short amount of time . good for free not so much if had to pay .
got this and several other games in the series . this is by far the best . i play it constantly to pass time when i 'm not busy .
it was fun playing this , love all versions of spider ... .its an easy version to learn with . its a keeper and fun for a time filler when you have a few minutes to spare .
this is a very funny game . you feed candy to the monster . better than angry birds . best game i have .
my granddaughter and grandson love this game the excitement they have when they pop the balloons and the surprise falls from them is great .
this is nice for some people but not for me . it just does n't give you that much info for what your make up would be .
i really like this game . i love word searches and this is great because it not your typical word search game . which makes it fun but a little challenging but not too hard . awesome game !
my friend had this app and i watched her play it , then i got addicted to it , everyday i 'm on it now
i love this game it is really fun and super addictive . i would recommended this game to anyone and everyone .

awesome game to play keep them coming yea cant wait for more games like this this is one cool game
easy game , too short in my opinion , finished it in less than half an hour . plenty of clothes , not enough levels .
really good app - it 's constantly updated with fun stuff . just wish it did n't take up so much memory on my kindle
this game really makes you think . my kids can play the first few levels but that 's it . i really believe it really makes you use your brain . and very addicting . fun
kinda fun for 5 to ten min but gets old fast . wo n't play often , works for when your bored in a waiting room or something .
this app is very fun once you get used to it and now whenever i want to play a game this is the first one .
this asked me to rate it after only three games ... ..i think that is alittle too soon to rate any game .
if you like fighting and puzzle games . you will love this game . once you start playing you will not want to stop . only downside is it runs on energy .
i love this version on my kindle . it 's very user friendly . i can take notes , highlight , cross reference and get many different translations . i wish it was available in a non online version .
this game makes you think . sometimes it seems hard then all of a sudden you figure it out . it 's usually more simple than you think .
this is another word game that is fun to play . i like it very much . i would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys word games that interact with other people .
it is what it is . it is tic tac toe . i like the difficulty levels . the hardest is very hard , but the easiest is easy
one of the best sudoku games available . wish there were more than one a day , so i sometimes play the same game again !
i l love this app . i use it all the time to help me figure out what i need . it is designed very well and easy to use . i recommend this app highly .
good find the objects game with a storyline that 's interesting . works well on my kindle except for not being able to pick up objects the first try . sometimes takes repeated attempts .
once i started playing i had a hard time stopping . i 'm still playing the free part and will probably purchase the full version .
great game . very entertaining and lots of fun to play . i would recommend to a friend and they would not be disappointed
i really enjoy this game . i played it all the time . with my grandma and now i play it with my own children
i love it you could just take a gun and shoot it its a cool game really fun awesome and cool
this is a really fun and addicting game . i am having so much fun playing it and creating new and interesting recipes ! @
harder and easier at the same time than temple run 1. very glad they let you keep your coins between runs though or i 'd never get anywhere .
i think it 's a fun creative game i wish they did a little bit less of the work but overall it 's great .
where 's my perry is an upgrade of where 's my water . it 's my favorite game on my kf . i have almost beat the whole game in 2 days . this game is simply addicting .
mine i think it 's glitch or the app i pressed on it but sometimes it does n't count i get frustrating when that happens other wise it 's a great app i put 1 star because the thing
this games is fun but sometimes crashes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
i play this a lot . it 's fun and a great time killer , no issues with the app itself and you do n't need wifi to play !
it is a fun silly little game that is rather amusing ! you can unlock all characters without in app purchasing !
this application is very useful and good . wo n't use to much memory on your phone and easy to follow . you can get it for free at google play market . this makes exercises fun !
my two kids ( a 2 year old boy and 4 year old girl ) both love playing with this game all day ! !
this game too would not load up so i got rid of it too . it was a free game so i can not say one way or the other .
fun ca n't wait to buy the whole game . wish that i could unlock more levels for free . wish there were more games like this
this game is awesome if u do n't like it that 's just sad i can play with my sister while shes sitting next to me
fun to play with friends . ads are annoying , but it 's better than having to pay money for the app . but it 's a good game anyway .
i make sure i play this game every day it is fun to play it they have another i play every day .
great graphics . needed a pinball game for my new kindle and this one is fantastic . a lot of challenging games .
this game is a fun one to help pass the time . nice for those time that you are just sitting around and waiting , like the dentist and doctor 's . games are short and challenging .
i thought i had the best bingo game available on my kindle , that was until i tried this one . keeps me entertained for hours , and it is free .
beautiful photos of beautiful sites that remind me who god is . easy to use application ... quick download . i like the colors that are so vivid .
i like the app , it does everything i need it to do . i dont have any complaints really , it just works .
i am now on my second generation of families and i absolutely love this game ! its an easier version of sims .
this is another great game . frequent bonuses and good spins . five stars from me . you 're not forced to buy coins .
this is an all time favorite of card games to play . done very well with colors and speed . lots of various settings . this is definitely a keeper !
i have been searching and searching through all the pet apps and games i could find on my kindle for a good pet game . unfortunately , this is not it . pretty boring .
great app to have whenever you need to jam ! love the fact i can listen to any type of music and my local radio stations !
this game is pretty fun i 'm only rating it at 4 stars became a use its not the game for me
overall it 's a fun way to kill time ... i wish you started off with a few more coins . great for all ages .
a very easy game to play . it only has 100 levels . and they were easy to get through . i had hoped for more levels .
got this game for my grandkids and my husband is now addicted to it ! ca n't wait for more levels to be released !
burn the rope as fast as you can . love the idea and it 's really fun playing it . free app . what more do you want .
even with the small screen and format it lets me choose several different news items on different pages . scrolling through seems quick and easy .
i like it but it is n't a favorite to play . it is ok for a 10 year old to play the game .
fun exciting build the town game . there is great graphics and fun missions . the only bad things it takes a while to level up and where you have to buy items . i love playing it .
this game keeps me busy when i 'm waiting for someone or just to pass the time away . i recommend this to people who like strategy games .
this a great game and enjoy playing very much . i played it when i was young with a deck of cards and was glad to enjoy it again on my kindle .
the game was great until i could n't solve the puzzle . did n't realize that you have to pay to proceed to the next question . you ca n't skip - you must pay .
fun and easy game to play , although later levels tend to get a bit frustrating . controls are easy to pick up , and graphics are cute and fun .
this is a family favorite . we all love it and get stuck on it for hours . even the baby plays it . i would recommend
this does what it says it will do and it does it very well if you are looking for these sounds .
i enjoy trying to figure out the logic in the game . it 's difficult and yet quite fun . it takes me awhile to figure out the puzzles .
this is a challenging , great to pass time with when there is nothing else to do if you do not get bored .
this game is okay ... i found it a little hard , on level easy . anyway , soccer scores rarely go above 4 points
game is ok i have played better ones would not have bought if it was not free app of the day .
this game is the best game i have ever played in my life ! the people who have never played this before , i think you should get this game !
i like the game but it takes to long for the energy to refill ! ! ! great graphics keep the good games coming .
i do n't play this game , but it seems to keep my kids entertained . na na na na hey hey hey good bye .
my little one loves this game . and i think it really helps his motor skills for what you have to do in it .
great game for the whole family with a fair amount of tokens given out on a four hour basis enjoy the game
i have this app on my phone , my computer and now on my kindle . it is good for when you do n't have a tv and would like to watch something .
it a good way to pass time as you are waiting . i even like the ideal that you can change to back ground seen on it . nice game .
i ca n't get this downloaded to my kindle . went through process of getting adobe file but it sits in my download file and wo n't allow this app to launch .
this game is easy to catch onto , the shooting is a little touchy , but overall it can keep you occupied while killing time .
this game is terrible on kindle fire . it is very bad you can not do anything with it it is stupid .
i think that everyone should have and like this game . i think this is the best game in the world
this is cute , but is mostly just a time waster . i like to show it to my grandchildren and let them play with it , but even they get bored with it pretty quickly .
i love all of the escape games , and i especially enjoyed this one because i could keep the sound off while playing .
can not see things as i do on my other devices and they jump around and when i select something it goes where it wants
i like to play hearts every day . i ca n't seem to fine how to change the difficulty of the game . i would like to teach the game to my kids .
this game was so much fun to play ! the colors of the different seasons were so bright and beautiful ! i will recommend it to all my friends !
nothing special about it . just ok. no real challenge to it , got kind of boring to play . deleted it from my kindle
nice fun game . if golf is your game to play this will be fun for you . kids will find it nice to play .
my grandaughter loves the cutting his hair and decorating and she can even make him laugh need to get her a little girl one to work on .
this app has gotten worse every day . constantly stopping for no reason . great content but it would be faster to drive to the library .
played this for years in books before , but just downloaded it and played . it was fun . could be more words
it will not load on my kindle ! . & # 34 ; getting right to the point ! & # 34 ; because this box only allows so many words , per box .
yeah again , only was able to watch on computer so now it awesome to catch my shows elsewhere as long as i can connect
it was not challenging enough for me , it is best suited for children . i like angry birds better and it more fun
it is fun , though there are apps that are more fun than this . i have more story apps that i need to keep track of .
finally a game that says it is free and it truly is . i give it five stars just for that . and the game is fun to thanks for making it .
i like angry birds , it helps to pass the time and i like it more without the ads . thanks for that .
my husband loves having this on his kindle , he watches it all the time . he says he has access to movies and series that are not found on netflix or on hbo on demand .
this is a little too repetitive for me , but it is addictive and i keep trying to get to the next level .
this solitaire does n't allow you to keep track of your scoring , turn 3 cards at a time , etc . overall i did n't enjoy playing it at all .
if you are looking for a quick game that will challenge your memory skills than this one is for you .
i had absolutely no problems using this app . it was a huge help in the kitchen . you 'll wonder why you never got this one .
very cool but coins are so hard to get i play on medium mode you get 2 coins a level
i like games like this and so far this is a good one . if you have patience then you do n't have to spend money to play the game .
same thing as flappy bird . very fun and addictive . if you ca n't find flappy bird get this . my high score is three ! ! ! ! ! ! !
this game is very fun . it is also a quick game . i wish the graphics were a little bit easier to read . i will play this bingo a few times a week
i play every night . no different then any other bingo , i just enjoy playing .
this app will not work unless you have cable television thru them . it will not give you television channels for free .
this app is adicting you should get this app i really like it . there are a lot of apps like it . i reccomend them all .
ok , some quotes are suitable to go into a card , but not enough .
it 's a free app and my boys like it . gives them something to do while riding in the car or waiting .
a fun hidden object game with puzzles that do n't frustrate . a good game to play , put away and play again .
yeah its cool but i deleted it cause i got mad at a level but its pretty cool ! you should get it .
such a fun and addicting game . lots of fun to try and solve each level . for people of all ages !
i enjoy playing this game . keeps you thinking . the different monster provide a different twist and the students challenges keep things interesting . i recommend for a quite evening when trying to relieve the days stress .
works fine . i 'm going to have to get used to using it on the kindle - it 's different than on the computer .
although there 's a line of fire , the bird does n't follow the line . i prefer the other games . there 's no reason this game should cost $ 3 ... not worth more than $ 1
i purchased this app for my grandson . am very pleased with this . i highly recommend this to anyone . two thumbs up !
i have always enjoyed playing scrabble , but this game is a lot more challenging . if you have not tried , please do . i am ready to challenge you
this game is real fun . it has the best virtual life on amazon . i really enjoy playing this . it has a long time for waiting but other than that its real funny ! !
i really like family feud & friends . i wish more of my & # 34 ; friends & # 34 ; played , though . lol . it is a cool app . no complaints .
love this game . the levels are difficult enough to be challenging but not too hard for you to be successful with a little thought . very addictive . ca n't wait for the sequel .
love this game ! my husband got me started on this game and now we go back and forth on who can get the highest score . so fun and addictive , you 'll love it !
this version is better than the facebook one also i like playing games on my tablet not so much my computer . the colors are vibrant the content is better and not so much wait time without doing anything .
it is what it is . i like to catch news from several sources . cnn is not my first choice , but the app is great and easy to use .
just started playing and wants rated already . a little to soon but so far it 's okay . you spell what the pictures have in common from a list of letters that is showing .
it 's really fun but needs more hints or need to be able to win more coins . but still it 's fun
i love backgammon . the only problem i have is that i believe the game may be cheating me . the game usually wins .
it 's nice to have a how to guide in a style that i do n't usually use . i do n't like buying apps , but it allows you to go through things without paying for a while .
check this every day . there always is something in the news that i wo n't find out until later in the day or tomorrow .
its not that good but its sorta okay but ive played better games than this . it actually is boring kinda
this is by far my favorite android game . it is very challenging but at the same time is relaxing to play . the music and the graphics are wonderful .
very nicely laid out . clear and easy . i love this free app of the day , just what i needed ! would recommend it
not enough free play . wants you to purchase dollars . not enough time to enjoy before you are asked to purchase points .
i use to play this all the time and it 's fun , but there are other games that i just like playing better !
i certainly think it is worth the 99 cents i paid for it . really glad i did n't spend the five bucks it originally cost .
i downloaded this on my kindle fire and it works great and does the job in helping me to relax and concentrate when i have too many things on my mind .
wow . its pretty good , with ways to get to different levels and you have to work to get to the next level .
i like it , it keeps you thinking on how to do this on each level . it may look easy but its harder than it looks .
this wo n't save my progress ! ! a bunch of other reviewers said that too . extremely annoying . gave it a star cause it 's really fun .
could n't get it to work while using words with friends and gave up after trying too many times . this is terrible .
i did like this game , but it seems it crashes way too much anymore and will barely load . i hope that this app will be fixed soon .
the games are easy to navigate and fun to play . there are lots and lots of different ones which is nice . i thought maybe it would be limited .
just like the original restaurant story except with a few special items and deals . same problem i have with all games like this , you ca n't get far with out having to spend money .
lots of fun . just got it , so far so good but has stopped running not sure what 's up with that ?
i have n't actually had a chance to try this out yet . i 'm looking for something to try it out on .
good way to pass time . the bad is you run out of coins to fast ... you can not buy new clothes without coins
it 's a fun game for me and my girls . they fight over who gets to feed her or brush her
this app is like 2 in 1 ! you get to play hundreds of games on one app and can spend a lot of time . truly fun !
this game is a lot of fun and very challenging , but it was over way too soon . i am hoping they come out with a sequel .
love the game it helps pass the time away without losing all your money and you also get to meet new people
this game was just no fun for me ! i thought i would like it but found myself bored with it .
this app was very disappointing did n't do what i expected . it failed to open on my kindle for several times .
this one would have gotten 5 stars if it had been a little longer . great graphics and storyline that kept my interest we 'll . i finished it in one day .
very relaxing . picking out the fish is a lot of fun and they are so cute . everything also looks so realistic and detailed .
netflix is a great thing to have on your devices . easy to use and great movies for young and old !
i just love it . at first i did n't know what i was doing but it did n't take me long . it really makes me think before i start moving my stylus over it .
this game is both fun and challenging . i played this game on someone else 's tablet but could n't get it on mine at the time . i was excited to see it was now available .
i have played on facebook on my computer for a long time but got addicted enough to have to have it on my kindle fire also . challenging and addictive , always something different with every level .
this game is very enjoyable ! the puzzles make you think and the graphics are very nice . i look forward to each level .
what a great game . it brings back wonderful fun filled hours . i love it and would recommend it to everyone .
i love this game . it is a fun & # 34 ; action & # 34 ; game . the characters are cute and funny and the scenery is great .
this is a great time killer but i only give it three stars because it is hard to progress . after a while i lose interest and shut it off .
i cant stop playing . plus i am even better with words with friends . i love playing this game . awesome game .
my idea is then at well this games is ok i mean it 's not that good if what they say it 's amazing but then when u play with it it 's just boring
maybe it 's me , but i have better , more fun things to do with my time . perhaps , i 'll try another time and like it better .
its not the greatest , but not the worst , its ok , the game is fun for about ten minutes then you end up losing interest .
based off of real life actions , in this game you mine gold to earn money and advance to the next level , you can buy upgrades to help you along the way .
love the hidden object games . very challenging and fun to play . love playing these games with the challenging that come with the game .
yahoo is very easy to navigate and to keep up with news and whats going on in the world . it 's a good place to have an email account as well .
overall , i 'd rate this version of solitaire a 4 out of 5. i did n't care for the ads before the beginning of the game .
very fun and addictive game . if you loved happy fall then you should really enjoy this game . i cant stop playing : ) .
this game was fun to play . it has a good theme and a good story line . good for people who like hidden object games .
downloaded and played . did not like horrible to play.i did not like this game and would not recommend to friends .
sometimes , when i try to win at the night club , it freezes completely . if this was fixed , the game would be perfect !
just started this game fun so far will see how it goes . it has me thinking a lot but that a good think
this app is a good one with the exception of the ads . been using it for several months now , and the down fall is the ads . please offer a paid version .
oh , what a game . keeps you on your toes . i would truly recommend this game to all of my family members and friends .
only one of each game in the light version . so cute and educational that i bought the whole version immediately .
simple , easy , well designed . save it from your computer , read it wherever . this is one to keep . you will use it .
my daughter had played this game with someone at school . she loaded it onto her kindle and has played it alot . she loves it and she said she loves it !
this is great for kids . it is very entertaining for them , when at the dr. 's it keeps them busy . great app .
would be great if were n't for the constant screen flipping . i tried everything to stop it but nothing would ... very disappointed because it seems fun ...
if you loved the original tetris , than you will love this game . it is a classic game that never fails to please .
i do n't have a lot patience for games , but this one is pretty clever . i do n't think i have ever played anything like it before . works great on evo 3d .
it 's a different hidden object game . it 's nice for a change . i only hope there 's a part two . maybe in the future if possible .
i love having this bright little flashlight right at my fingertips ! it 's handy in so many situations . best of all , it 's free .
my kindle now has a camera . i think i am going to like it . i look forward to using it to take lots and lots of fun photos .
this game is addicting . i play it often . i love it when it says , ho , ho , lets go . silly are n't i ..
i like the game but you seem to only be able to play 5 minutes before it wants you to buy something because every mission seems to take all the energy you have
like it a lot better than 100 floors . i 'm looking forward to more rooms . update soon please . my review is too short ... so i 'm adding this line .
this is a fun and challenging game with lots of hidden object scenes ! absolutely love it and totally recommend it !
i enjoy using facebook in my spare time . the kindle fire hd is easier to use than a smart phone and laptop .
it is okay if you like puzzles , bored and want something to do while passing time . however , the puzzles are so easy you can complete them all in a flash .
this app has sooooooo many awesome wallpapers its hard to choose just one . i like that you can save your favorites for later . would recommend this to everyone ! !
this game is ok but i 'm not that crazy about it , it seem a little tedious and hard to find the objects because they are so small
i have just started and its already awesome and addictive i wish it was on the kindle fire earlier yeah
i loved the first game and was excited to see a second title had come out . i hope to see a third installment soon , it will be worth the wait .
i love being able to print both from my android phone and my kindle . does a nice job from both devices .
this is a fun game with easy but fun puzzles . good graphics and a fun story . this is the first game from this company . will probably buy more .
download this for my son and he loves this game . he plays it all the time . i love that fact that he loves it and it didnt cost me anything .
i 'm just playing the trial but so far i am enjoying the game . just hard enough to make to hunt for an item but easy enough to play . i like it
i thought this was just for kids but i find myself playing it more . when i have to quit , i keep telling myself just 1 more which then turns into 2 or more !
this app is great for any kid or even an adult basically any one who knows their old school cartoons to this year cartoons .
love the game but wish i had realized the app i bought on the amazon market on my kindle fire was n't a version that would work on my kindle ...
a little confusing at first , but a really fun game once you get the hang of it . keep getting better !
love this game it makes time go by quick and i like to figure things out . that 's why i would recommend this game to a friend
lots of fun off the hook game , i 've played lots a slots this is a most enjoyable game easily played , have n't played anything else since i began this game
i think it is a very easy game to understand and it is so fun and it is so exciting
love it its fun and time consuming although i would love to get the version it 's a must get its awesome
i am an older adult and i love this ! it 's just mindless fun but sometimes that 's exactly what you want !
not bad but you have to wait for gems to fall which can take awhile . it be nicer if you could get a full lot to work with .
starts out easy , gets more and more challenging . i end up playing way more than i should because it 's so addicting
my grandsons and i are huge fans of the original doodle jump . this variation is terrible and has been deleted from our kindles .
the game itself is fun , i would just like to be able to play it offline . i do n't have internet access at home .
i like games like this because . i 've always wanted to be a big sister . you really need this app if going to be a big sister
if you do not watch out this game will help you pass a lot of time . even my son loves to play .
very fun and addictive game . mega cute graphics . very challenging and lots of fun . great game and free . what more could you want ?
this app is really good because you get to not only have the original talking tom but take care of him at the same time ! i recommend this app for anybody and everybody .
have to agree with others about graphics of this game and also am becoming a fan of this developer . playing a few of their games and enjoy all of them .
like the alarm clock feature . the other sites within this app are great . i really do n't have 7 more words to add to my review .
i love this game stopped playing than came back to it now i ca n't stop playing it . i recommend everyone to play it .
this is a wonderfully intriguing game that increases in difficulty at a very nice pace . music and sweet creatures are relaxing while not boring .
best game ! play all the time . highly addictive ! do n't ever change except to add more vehicles or levels . and it is free too !
i love playing solitaire . this one is interesting so i thought i would try it . i do n't play it a lot , but it is fun .
i love this game ! it is so cute and highly addictive . cant put it down even going to pay the 3.99 for unlimited play so worth it
graphics are gorgeous , music is beautiful and play is just hard enough so you do n't get bored ! love it big time !
very addictive . just when you think you 've got it figured out , you find out you do n't ! fun game ! should n't have to pay for more hints !
it was my casual pastime while my girls were in school . i get bored sometimes . it helps to have another pastime .
this app is awesome . i really like how there are different kinds of games for everyone . my favorite kinds of games are puzzles and challenging games .
i rated it high because it 's a challenging game , that works well for kindle fire because of its size . and detail .
neat little fun puzzles . my little girls really like them . and its free . what could be better ? this is a must if you have little ones .
i 've only been playing a short time but it is fun and challenging . i guess i do n't know as many logos as i thought !
this is a very fun app for my kindle fire ! my grandkids enjoy playing with it and creating beautiful pictures .
it was fun to play . why do i have to have at least 10 words ? it 's a simple app , not a freakin ' complicated purchase .
it gives you choices on what live wallpaper but then after u pick it it goes way . its a nice app but if ur looking for a live wallpaper do not install this app .
i never get tired of this game it challenges you no matter how many times you go back and try doing it to better your score .
i like playing this new game . it is a little hard to get the cards where you want them to go . but over all it is a good game .
i play solitaire quite a lot and now i can play while i am in bed at night . it 's great .
a very addictive game . of course the minions are cute . i wish that you could win some of the coins instead of having to purchase them .
love this game . i can not believe how hard but easy it is . it is so much fun . love it .
every time u get done playing on the map it 's asks you : get full version : which is very annoying so no i will not get full version
the pics do n't load for me . the app offers upgrades for additional money . i wish i knew this before i downloaded it as i do n't plan on purchasing the upgrade .
the game is pretty fun but after awhile it will get boring but my son seems to like it more so i keep it for him to play .
its a little tricky for a 5 year old but with a little help its a fun game for kids !
it helps kill time and when i ca n't be with my own horse this helps me not miss her too much . my children enjoy it too
fun and exciting game that will give you hours of fun ! enjoy playing this with your kids and even learn something together .
the game was as fun as chess most of the time you don ` t know why you died in the process .
i have been playing all afternoon between 2 games . it has been a great day . i usually do not get that much free time . thank you it was fun !
this app is misleading . i thought i liked it when i got it but then it really started to bore me
having fun just looking at the pictures and seeing the animals . enjoying guessing what is behind the covers . ca n't wait to see the other games .
i downloaded this a couple days ago and i love it . it 's a unique and challenging game , definitely worth the $ $ .
pretty fun game ! ! ! ! i just started ! ! ! it takes awhile to get used to and it takes forever to level up ...
this is a great game , requires a little thought here and there . more levels would be nice . especially like the bonus levels !
easy to use . has different solitaire games in it . i only play the 3 card flip style but you can play any of the others at no charge also .
the games really fun if your bored and it 's fun if you know the movies ignore the bad reviews you should get this app
this is the best mahjong app . that i have found . lots of different levels . choose from many different backgrounds and playing designs . in a word . awesome .
it 's a okay game as long as it do n't get started same ones after another . i really enjoy this game more than people know
this is great to have and be able to read every morning before starting a new day . no complaints from me .
i have a number of slots games and this is a favorite . the graphics are very attractive the operation is smooth . you get a nice size bonus which allows you to keep playing .
got it for free but it is a great game to play and get addictive to when you really start playing
i believe this would be okay for some who are not looking for a mind boggling experience . i prefer other hidden objects game better .
has limited formats ! ! but it will do a professional job with the photos you choose ! ! excellent photo tool ! ! ! ! ! !
this game is so addicting and fun ... i like how i can play with people from around the world ... it 's a very very fun game : )
ok for an angry birds copy . it does n't seem to progress as smoothly though . maybe it 's just me but angry birds seems to be more fun .
great game to keep the mind and eyes alert . this is the best game for older generation to keep the mind and thoughts going .
because it has fake facts and most of it i know . the cool things are there is true facts too .
fun . keeps me entertained for hours . the more i play , the more addicting it gets . five plus more words required .
quick and easy to play . just swipe from one item to another . good for any age . gets harder on each level to keep your interest .
it is a good game but i hate waiting for hours for some thing to get built but everything else is good
i want to give this 5 stars . but it has no landscape mode for my tablet . please fix to auto rotate and work with tablet to get

this game is flat out boring . not worth the waste of time to download and install . would not recommend at all
this is a fun little app . some of the riddles are tricky , but you can figure them out with the letters they give you .

its wont let me go to the next level until i get all of it logos right hey but just one problem i said
so much easier playing on the tablet than my phone . enjoying playing . do n't need to know how do draw well , just need the desire to have fun .
i really like word games . but there really isnt much of a word game here . just another match 3 type game . blah ... uninstalling .
i like the way it challenges you on every hunt but it takes gold , coins that you need to buy things , faster than it gives , other than that its real fun
this game keeps me excited . i would have to say its one of the best to play on kindle . i give two thumbs up .
this app constantly crashes on me , and it was n't really worth the time of trying to download it to play it on my kindle fire . would rather use the pc for this one ; )
my older son plays with this good app . it is easy to use and time certainly flies . to stay at home with family and share with them
the quality is good and you can change the set up of the deck and game rules . it has ads in between games , but you can skip them . you can play without internet .
i think it is nice 2 hav a conversation even if it is the same one every time . cute game .

this game is original and very challenging . i wish the tutorial was a little more thorough , but i suppose that would make it too easy .
i enjoyed this game a lot , but it was really annoying that almost every time i wanted to play it , it would freeze up my kindle
where 's my perry , and now this . temple run . brave . no connection . brave was n't even a good movie from what i 've heard .

i absolutely love this app . the quotes are always inspiring and right on time . i just wish it had a widget .
this is very cute . my grandkids thought so too . i would say it is for kids 6 and under . but i liked it too .
i give it 4 because it would be great for a very young child , my daughter is 4 and it was extremely easy for her , so i would n't recommend it for a child over 3
completely , 100 % free . if you want to leave a rating , that is ... .. i love these games for that reason ... . and they 're super fun !
i got my son this app and he absolutely loves it ! it 's a nice little learning app for kids and i notice him thinking and solving through the exercises .

this game is hard , but not too hard . also extremely addicting . and its free . stop reading reviews and just download it .
it was not explained well enough , not sure how you play this particular type of game . i 'll pass on this one .
it takes forever to load i waited ten mins and it still was still loading . and u cant get off until fully loaded
this game is cool , not to hard but it is challenging a good free download , it will make you think and is a good time passer . try it .
facebook has let me stay in touch with friends and family in many different ways . i see many interesting videos from youtube that i would n't have seen otherwise .
our daughter loves writing in alphabet using this app . she likes to use a many colors as possible . it entertains for whenever we need it .

this game is so much fun . i ca n't put it down . some of the puzzles are harder than others but it gets easier the more you play .

this game seemed like a lot of fun if it was your type of game . i thought the different pigs were cute .
i loved this game when i was young . still a great game now . my son gets excited when he gets to use the kindle so he can try to learn this game .
- game play is too slow . was hoping things would speed up after 3 or 4 games but they stayed at the same slow pace . graphics & amp ; sound are ok .
this is a good variety of bingo games . you need to pay attention , but no way are you bored as it goes fast .
this keeps my toddler occupied . i like how it teaches cause and effect . it would be nice though if most of the animals made their actual sound .
this app so supposed to enhance photos for better clarity but did n't see any difference in the photos . not reccomended for anyone who needs to clear up a blurry photo .
it 's a very interesting game . i love seek and find and this one is very challenging . thanks for offering it
i have found many uses for this great light , one of them is reading at night . i use this light to read at night so i do not wake everyone up . works so great !

if only it was the full version . but since it is n't i do not ha e fun with it . what the heck !

i like it , it 's a easy pull out and play game for any time fun . i recommend it to all . = )
this game took too much memory on my phone and ran too slow . i had to take it off my phone .
i found this fun in the beginning but after you know where all the items are , it gets rather boring so i deleted it . maybe if it had more levels .
allows you to review and manage your apps very easily . very useful app , highly recommended . matter of fact , i think it is a must have app .

was not thrilled when i found it was a puzzle . but when i started working on it really enjoyed it . i especially like the beautiful plant puzzles .
game is a unique take on puzzle games . so far i have completed a few levels . i am disappointed that it cost money to get hints . which is why i choose 3 stars rather than 4 .

its very very cool i love the pets they are so cute i wish they were real omg the kids
i did n't enjoy because the game was slow and really no potential for me to play as i was not challenged enough
controls are a bit small and it does n't have a lot of replay value , but it was free and fun . ca n't ask for much more .
this game gives you a lot of styles to pick from . if you get stuck , you can shuffle the tiles and go on until all the tiles are used . rather than just having the game end .
a brain teaser , my friends think that its a great game . i love it.it 's a lot of fun . play it all the time .
great ! ! my 3 year old enjoys all the puzzle games on this app . good way for him to learn . thank you .

it no longer works . it said it stopped working and i do n't know why . it gives no explanation as to what to do once it says it has stopped working .
i am a huge bingo fan & this game is a lot of fun . the only thing that sucks is how long it takes to get credits . definitely recommend if you are a bingo fan .
i especially love that i can play off line , sometimes i do n't have internet so that worked out for me . fun .
enjoyed playing this game . a lot of going back and forth , but still held my interest . i like hidden object games with a story line .

easier to navigate than weather channel app . glad i found this one . use it at least once a day . great
i like this game a little more than some of the other hidden object games . this one keeps you on your toes .
the game is enjoyable but sometime tiles are hidden under the stop , pause or go back keys on the right of the screen .

i wrote down stuff i needed to get done and with this app on my kindle i could check it easily to see my progress . it works very well .
it 's ok. i just wish there was a way to skip to the next word when you are stuck . also there should be a feature to scramble the letters .
it takes a little while to get the hang of this game but once you know what you are doing it is a lot of fun . could be addictive .
this game is very challenging and i would definitely suggest that you get it , the greatest thing is that it 's free .
cool game . its pretty fun like the others but i loved that it was for movies only . its definitely challenging but its exciting at the same time
good game . good graphics . could describe the guns and upgrades for them better so i know what my money goes to .
its a real fun app , but i think some of think some of the games are actually quite hard . but their really fun too . so it makes this app such an adicting app .
i like this game though clues without words make it difficult to figure out but i like the challenge . nice job creators .

it was n't the best but it was fun but it can get very boring when you play it so much do get it if you get board really quick of games .
this app is so bad and the music gets on your nerves . second , the kitty goes too slow and its hard to maneuver .
any girl that wants too have great time it is great and all the people that says it is bad they are wrong . : )
ok graphics on a timed game but the objects do n't disappear or turn color or something so you know you 've found them . not worth the buck
ok it says free however it only lets you play so far then it wants you to pay for the upgrade
lots of fun and hard to put down . it 's a great game for all ages to enjoy and easy to follow .
the game was fun and had good graphics . it only lasted me about ten minutes before it was locked due to me having to pay for the rest of it . not truly free .
great game . not the most or worst . but good . not a terrible game but not that great either . it is good .
maybe because i watch a lot of movies but it seems too easy a game . i would recommend to others .
not exactly what i was looking for but fun . i like hidden object mystery games and this one is fairly easy to play .
it pretty much does the work for you . it is not real challenging . i got bored with it really quick
i would say that this game is fun . it also has a problem being consistently harder as the game goes on .
having lots of fun playing it . i love playing these kind of games . very entertaining to play . i would get it again .
it was n't exactly what i thought it was , but it 's okay . do n't get it unless you 're very familiar w/ scripture verses .
i thought this would be a lot of fun to play this game but not so , maybe i do n't understand it totally
this game drives my cats nuts ! they keep looking for the animals . the game is fun for me too . love it !
great word game and one that can get addicting but in a good way . really makes you use your brain .
i love this app . this app is extremely adorable . the monsters are very cute . i recommend this app to any of my friends .
classic word search game , fun and different levels of difficulty . would recommend for anyone who enjoys to do word searches
i did n't mind this game but even for a free one there are n't very many puzzles available , most of the puzzles and features are behind purchases and the ads are annoying .
i love this game.. i was hooked right away and even while away on vacation , i played for 5 hours straight . definitely download this one !
love it and i 'm just doing this for stuff it 's just awesome i like this more then anything i just love it
i love this game ! it is so fun and make s you think . it is an app for kids and adults .
i love it . it 's so much fun so many weapons lots of fun you should get this app and rate it
i ca n't put it down . fast paced and keeps you looking for the objects . much easier than some of the other games out there . highly recommend .
my sister got me hooked on this game it is interesting i most say you do need to thank on some moves
this was not what i was looking for and did not give me the information i was looking for but i plan to keep it for future use and hope to find it more helpful with more use .
i just love pinball so i dont have much to say about it , it takes me back to the good old days
good game but after i played it for about two weeks i checked my gallery of pictures on my kindle and there were about 200 random pictures of gameplay buy game but check your pictures
this is the game everyone has been talking about and it is finally on kindle , still trying to get it but i am very happy to be a part of the candy crush saga family ,
some are not very good differences just the name of the object does n't really mean the odd one too much to use a hint so get stuck easily
i love this game on facebook and was so happy to see it for kindle . great graphics and colors . ca n't wait to see how far i get .
very good close to flappy birds . my high score is n't that high but it is still amazing like flappy . birds
i play this on my android phone and my kindle . great game , works quite well , never freezes , great graphics . probably the most reliable app i use .
love this game . love how it has so many different levels compared to the other slots . the graphics are pretty cool too .
not what we expected . thought the kids would love to play this but it does n't keep their interest at all
the play gets more and more difficult as you go along . a simple concept that takes much concentration . lots of fun .
this game is a very good game . you can level up , and earn guns . you get money for every game you play . very addictive too
what the heck is with all the permissions ? why do you need to know exactly where i am just so i can throw some crap at a zombie ?
i love this game . have played it for years on my computer and was happy to find it for my 8.9 & # 34 ; fire . easy to play and a lot of fun .
all my grandchildren love this game . it is nice to have it on the kindle ! it made a trip to the dr. much more entertaining !
this is a fun game . can be challenging at times but the hints help . you should get it . fun for kids or adults . test ur knowledge
i love the fast paced game play . i have played for a few hours a day and i love the game . my grandchildren play it and i have a great time trying to get the best score .
never get this app.i did not understand it and did n't really get the point of it it is so stupid .
used to play this game on the laptop and it is much more fun on the kindle fire great job can not wait till the next one is released (
i enjoy playing the game . i find it a bit to small and it makes it hard to play , also i do n't like to be timed .
i am not fast at making words . maybe if i played more often i would see words faster . i try too hard to get big words . it is entertaining and works my brain .
i really enjoy using this app . the word searches range from easy to hard and for me at least i always felt challenged . i recommend this app for everyone 10 years and older .
lots of fun games . you play for points to unlock more games which i like . there is something for everyone . a must have !
this app is terrible i thought it was for the kindle but its for phones i was soooooo mad ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i wish it had more stuff to do i am super mad
g5 did a fantastic job with this game ... different types of games that i 've never seen anywhere else ... even from g5 ... i am very impressed ...
this is really awesome . i love drawing characters from a good game ! i really recommend this to those who love to draw . these drawings are step by step , too !
i like the puzzles and how they all work together to get you to the end . excellent little game for the price . fun to replay . works well on kindle fire .
love it . love it on my pc for years love it even more today . try to play as much as i can
this game is really fun and addicting , i had the game poo fall , it was fun bit then i got this game . i play this everyday
it worked when i got it 1st time but now it will not work . please fix this or people will delete it like i did just now .
if you played one temple run you played all of them . i do n't find the point of downloading this game if you already have temple run .
i am really enjoying this game ! puzzles you need to solve to be able to get out of a locked room . entertaining .
i did n't even play it yet . i think it will be fun though . all the apps that everyone rates are bad , i like .
dang . this is awesome ! i did all levels without even losing a life ! are any of you surprised ? you have to be surprised .
i 'm enjoying both the artwork and the game , though it 's not an entirely new format or story . still , it 's pretty and entertaining .
i love this game so much that i hope they make a second one . ive never been so addicted of playing a game .
i found this fun enough to get the full version . it 's a thinking game but i kind of lost interest after a while .
it 's a really cute game . that is all i really have to say about the game . this is a lot of fun and addicting .
this is very challenging and is detailed for bible readers it truly test your knowledge which is a great reminder of needing to read the word more . the app is very clear and free
way too slow earning swords to clear space very slow progress ! not much money or experience either ! and you ca n't play offline ! not one of my favorite games !
i want to delete it now but i cant because it isnt install now i cant install it thanks a lot dont get it
downloaded this app but did n't use it as much as a previous app . not saying it does n't work - was n't for me , i was too used to the other one .
great app and fast . easy to download . works on my kindle fire hd as good as using the computer . i recommend this , would get it again , and i hope this helps someone .
enjoy bingo games . this one is a little different but fun to play . have to pay attention to boards but worth it .
good challenges and a variety of choices of mental exercises . only reason it does not have 5 stars is the print was quite small in spots for my old eyes .
i loved this game on my phone , i 'm loving the kindle fire version . it 's easier to move my little people around . just wish there were ways to customize my little people before i play .
this app is awesome ! ! ! ! ! i can always have a gun war with my brother and its soooooooo much fun ! ! ! ! ! ! u should totally get it !
i have not yet played this game . i just got it and i plan to spend many good times playing it
another hit with this company . rovio keeps making these great fun games . i thought at first it would be the same , but oh no , totally new game and lots of fun !
great game so i went ahead and got the full version ! this is perfect for relaxing and killing time no matter what your doing . i really hope they make more games like this ! !
this is a cool game we play everyday . kids love this game just downloaded it on my moms tablet . got ta try it
it is ok for a quick look at the current weather . i 'm not sure i 'm using it correctly but that is all i can get out of it .
i was not happy with this game and actually removed it from my kindle . it seemed awkward to me when playing this particular angry birds game .
i tried to download from my computer to my kindle with no results . this looked interesting and disappointed i ca n't play it .
i removed this game from my kindle . it would never work even after removing and downloading it again . i can not say i would recommend this to anyone .
now i do n't have to hunt for other players to have a game . it 's a lot of fun for one .
not good and have removed it from my kindle after trying it several times .
if u remember this game from back in the day than u will enjoy playing it again take my word u will have fun
i have played this as a car d game for years , and now enjoy playing it on my kindle fire hd
challenging yet not too hard . great game to pass some time with , or get completely lost in ! i also love the fact you can play the same game on many devices .
this is a solid puzzler . the levels are challenging and highly entertaining . if i could give it 6 stars i would .
works great on my kindle fire hd . i love being able to record something on the fly without having to turn on the tv .
you pretty much know what to expect . works just fine on both cell phone ( htc sense ) and kindle fire . no issues whatsoever .
i like this time management game . it ` s not too fast or too stressful . it is a good game to play when you need a break or sitting in the waiting room .
great game . make more ! i ca n't stop playing this game . i would like a never ending game like this one . less searching and more hidden game though .
i try various apps on my new phone as i come across them to see if they actually work as advertised and something i find i need . this app is a pretty good one .
love the challenge of this game . you think you know these things but they are n't as easy as you 'd think . i also like that you can reset and play again .
this is a really awesome game ! it 's so cute and fun to play ! despite the occasional freezing , its extremely addictive ! ! ! ! i love it !
my daughter likes some of the silly choices available , but does n't have a lot of options . does n't see to keep her attention .
my family and i love to solve these puzzles together ... . my son loved the game so much that he download it on his phone !
my granddaughter plays it for a few minutes and then wants to play something else . she finds it too boring . so i am going to delete it off my kindle
i 'm addicted ! i ca n't stop playing this amazing game ! i would definitely recommend this game to anyone and everyone ! i really enjoy playing this game !
best bongo app i 've seen so far . you get coins every 4 hours and the numbers are called at good pace .
i like it it 's great for road trips and just to play its fun minigames and good points it 's fun for for all ages and a fun time . : - )
good game can be very challenging at times . the for words series odds fun overall . i def recommend this game
my friends thought that this was the funniest thing that they had ever seen they actually thought that i had an iphone . i loved this app .
i like this one . i do prefer the temple runner 2 because i feel like the characters for some reason in this one are more difficult to maneuver .
good ole angry birds its like a bag of chips u can never have just one got to have them i can never let this game down
it 's ok but when u click for a walk through , it does n't give it to you but its still ok
apparently , i 'm doing something wrong . i 'll keep trying though cause using this app would be quite benefit . i use yahoo daily .
i hate it . i ca n't make it even move , no instructions . take it off my kindle . please & thank you .
this is a lot like bejeweled and it is a lot of fun to play so if you are looking for fun game without killing or you just want to relax this is the game for you .
addicting game that 's tons of fun ! if you like playing zuma then this game is perfect for you ! it has tons of levels and great power ups !
great to have to find out all the who you need to know about the doctor . lots of features . go get it .
really helped me get ready for my trip ! hopefully i do n't forget anything due to this wonderful app ! i love you !
it is so fun to create different avatar 's i could play this game all day it is so fun to do it i love it
fun and easy to play . the ads are not intrusive and help keep the game free . great way to play with friends .
ok i think i 'm hooked at least on the graphics have n't played game long enough to say more but hey i love free stuff so what more can you ask for in a free app !
i love this game . i tried the play first version and could not get enough so i purchased the game .
alot of items can not be seen until you press that area . would not recommend to any one . needs better visual .
this game is very fun , but for some reason it always lock up when trying to go to the next level . i had to end up deleting it . overall , it is a fun game .
i 'm stuck on the same level . too hard at times , especially at this time . i get bored not being able to go forward .
its ok but i can tell what mood i 'm in better than it can like when i 'm happy it says i 'm sad you have to try multiple times to get it right
on the game it says to update the game then it just takes me to the app store and does nothing else except keep telling me i need an update ...
the thing that i do not like is that there is no channel 's in this one i want it to be like to be like the web .
it was horrible . it clicked all the time on my kindle fire . i wish i could give it less than 1 star , but ...
need to make it a little easier . gets so fast . other than that i love it . very fun game . ca n't wait to level up .
i think this game is so fun . the look of it is very pleasing , the controls are simple , it offers lots of different birds and pigs to use .
i enjoy this app . very challenging with great options to solve . lots of puzzles to choose . it can become very addicting for crossword fans .
it could be better i mean it 's amazing with the art work but not what i expected so with this game before u play expect the un expected ... ... ... ... ... .. and ya .
my daughter wanted to buy this and i should have read the reviews before i let her . it is okay , but not an actual game .
after i played it , i found it was dumb . so i deleted it what more can i say i did n't like it .
even though the app was free ; it did n't work , could not watch my movies on my kindle . not a good app .
it is a good game but after a while it wo n't let you get on and the ipad version is better
i play it a little . that 's all i have to say . that 's all i have to say . that 's all i have to say .
harder than i thought it would be . not the hangman i played in school . several categories of words are given .
i got to play one level and it kept force closing . it was fun until i could n't go any further what the heck ! ! !
great for getting into the christmas spirit ! if you like & # 34 ; hidden object & # 34 ; games , this one will not disappoint ! get it and be entertained . thank you .
if it does n't work on your kindle then do n't waste the bad reviews . minecraft is fun but wait till cheaper . do n't . get the free version it just like iphone one horrible .
it is a waste of time and it do n't even work i was angry and it said i was in love it is stupid do n't get it if you are smart
i love this app it 's great . however there are many times that the downloads fail and do n't finish . all together though , it is a great app .
interesting game . fast paced . good graphics . good plot . hidden objects not too difficult . what more can i say ? good game .
i have had trouble sleeping for the last few days and with this app it put me right to sleep ! it sounds like real rain outside my window
not that cool . three yr old likes it for a minute then gets bored . only one feature that shows dinosaur pic and tells u name . its alright enough though . its free ! ! !
seems ok so far , not too far into it yet , you have to pay for hints and tips though ... but the game is free
this game is perfect for my daughter to play and i get an enjoyment out of playing this awesome game it brings back childhood memories .
i like the story the graphics but not so much the puzzles . worth the half price . sometimes you have to tap several times to make the object stick . l like the hints .
funny game - this game is what you might want to do at work but ca n't . it 's a funny concept .
i got this as a free app of the day game and i loved it quick play through though . i love escape game and this is the best i found very recommended .
this is a nice game . it would get five stars if all the puzzles were free but at least you can get one new puzzle each day as well as every weekend .
i 'm a facebook addict and this app makes it easier to read than on my phone and easier to access than on my computer .
this was a fun game to play . i love mysteries and hidden object games and this offered both ! i ca n't . wait for part two !
i was n't sure what to expect at first but i was hooked from the start . fun game . husband and son are hooked to . gameloft has done it again . great game !
i play this game a lot and especially enjoy the levels where you challenge yourself to see how high you can build the burger . lots of fun !
i chose this app over several others . the graphics are bright and vibrant . it is user-friendly . being able to play with others online is a plus . great app !
my children watch this short movie . they always laugh whenever they see it . child humor ... comes with free app version . worth it , if you children like angry birds .
this game is fun and addictive . i play every day and night . i would suggest this game for anyone . i do wish you could get more daily coin .
its going good so far love it great great great emails service will keep it for a very long time
easy to learn , easy to play , and addictive . so worth the price of a free download . several characters , and boards to unlock . this will keep you entertained for hours .
really creative app . never played before , but i could start . my kids have a thing for this game . definitely child appropriate .
free app of the day and well worth downloading . excellent graphics and good gameplay . good for all ages and abilities .
my 4 yr old shows me the app everytime she figures out what each little picture does , she loves it .
i play this game every day . it is a lot of fun to play family members and friends . of course it helps that i am good at it ! ( :
you do n't do anything what so ever on this game it is so boring . not funny at all . do not get this app
boring and i could n't get into it . i do n't like it but you might . so try i just thought it was boring .
i enjoyed playing candy crush and i truly love this also . i like everything about it the daily prizes , and everything .
meh ... you can try if you want ... only one actual game.. gets boring . maybe you 'll like it ... i uninstalled in a week .
this game is fast paced and fun . i only wish there were more levels to play . worth the money i paid .
it is a ok game i like it but could make it more smooth i still like it my wife even plays and she hates games
i have n't exactly played it yet but i was just wondering if you have to have facebook to play this game because i do n't have facebook but this game looked really fun ... .
fun and challenging . my 9 and 11 year olds love it too , good for both adults and children , had a blast !
this game is so much fun to play i can & quot ; t put it down its hours of fun i am up until 2 in the morning playing .
this game is super fun and addictive it is great for me and kids of all ages and it is great for trips even little kids this great for them because it is fun and kid friendly .
this app was amazing i love all the very cool and popular icons ! ! i recomend this to anyone that has free time .
my 12 year old grandson loves this game . he is an avid hunter and i got this for him . the youngest one is trying it now .
nice little time waster . makes you use your brain to figure out all the different puzzles you are required to solve to get to the next level
awesome entertainment for hours . it is a very fun app and a great time waster . love it a lot amazing
this is a grate game kinda hard to control but you will get the hang of it after a little bit .
a very nice way to start the day . i look forward to this . god is good and his word is blessing to me .
it 's ok , but it 's kind of easy . i can usually figure out the puzzles in a few seconds
this is a fun game except it takes forever to build your money up . it would be better if it did n't take as long to add up . but it is addicting .
i love this game i played it before i 've been waiting forever to download on to kindle fire and here it is ! ! it 's so much fun !
great app ! love this app . really like the notifications of battery level . like knowing how much time i have left on different actions .
i really love the app . i 'm so into horoscopes . this way its right at my finger tips . i keep ot on my my screen at all times
tested it out and it works ! ! i have it on both my devices . i think it is the best mobile security i have ever used .
this is a great app for killing time . the time limit for getting your coins could be less but other than that i have no complaints
this is a dumb game . i could not find a challenge or any way to improve the game . ended up buying it in a attempt to get to pac-man .
good game , makes you think . so far so good , you earn coins to buy hints or extra levels . i have n't had to use any real money yet .
i love pinterest so much fun . you will love it , post stuff and get useful ideas and there is funny pictures to make you laugh you should get this app
i really enjoyed the story and gameplay . the cut scenes were first rate . nice break from the hidden item games .
i love this game because i play real bingo and you can play this along time without running out of tickets quickly
fantastic game but very addictive ca n't wait to play all the time and to meet new people good game well done
fun game , easy to play and keeps you on your toes . great for & # 34 ; challenging & # 34 ; my granddaughters while we are all on our kindles !
i went through it pretty quickly , but i really enjoyed it . great graphics and game play . the hint feature speeds through .
good game but kind of monotonous after a while . i enjoy it but i know after a few days it will get boring and repetitive .
what can i say . i like it . it 's simple , easy , and helps me get my math homework done a hell of a lot faster .
this allowed me to connect with our printer printer and print out anything i need to from my kindle fire . one of the best free apps i 've ever downloaded !
i was really enjoying this game until l could n't go to another level unless l bought tokens using my credit card .
this slot is slot of fun . real slot games from the casino . but better be ready to purchase coins if you want to keep playing . takes them pretty fast .
this is a new twist on solitaire , i love this game , even more than playing spider solitaire . this is a great game .
i do not get it even with the tutorial i think they should give it better instructions but it seems fun ! !
fun app to pass the time . makes you think . i can see how it can be very addicting . great price for an awesome
its strange cu 's just yesterday i was thinking i really want temple run 4 my kindle so now i have it and its the best game ever !
i love this game ! i can choose to play one of my friends , or i can play a random opponent . either way , there are hours of entertainment with this game !
i unfortunately can not rate this app due to the fact you need the disney channel to use this app
i use this app to watch all of my favorite cw shows when i miss them on tv . works like a charm but the commercial breaks can be annoying .
i agree with all the comments about app ... please fix the problem ... so frustrating to almost finish but ca n't ... otherwise good app .
the graphics in this game are very good . the only thing i feel like that it 's too easy . wish it was more of a challenge .
when i looked at this app i thought it was boring and i installed it and turns out i really like it i cant stop playing
this game is good great for all of these people were having fun with the best possible games free for all your fan 's
love this game . it is so fun . i would recommend this game to anyone who has free time . not all is easy but most is
i like to play this game when i have some free time or am bored . . . . . .
easy , fun and a good way to pass time . works well for kindle fire . i recommend this game for whenever you need something fun to do for a while .
i 'm . really enjoying this game . nice graphics etc . i wish it had a zoom feature that would make it perfect !
i am having a great time playing this game . much better than floors . i love games that challenge my brain .
downloaded this app for kindle hd and it keeps freezing up on me . may be a good game , just do n't know .
this is an awesome good and super fun game to play ! i love it so very much if i were you i would get it ! !
it is fun and challenging . i found most objects but really had to search for some . would recommend it for all ages .
my daughter likes this game but got bored fast ! should have more things to do ! good idea though ! i like that it encourages care for animals .
i hope they come out with more levels for this game . i was sad when i finished it . kept me hooked for sure ! ! !
this game 's graphics are horrible and at first i was n't able to open it . but then when i did it was n't worth it
i had heard a lot of talk about this game but i did n't think i 'd enjoy it as much as i am . it truly is addictive !
its possible that i did n't just get the game , but it last like 3 minutes and all you do is crush bugs with your finger so unless there is another point i do n't recommend this game
sometimes it lags but it is a fun an addictive game . i really like to play the slots i think u should add more
it 's just like flappy bird it 's so much fun ... the game is a little challenging but i like challenge so if your like that this games for you : )
i am really enjoying playing at this site . it is a lot of fun and almost as good as the real thing
i 've had no issues with this game . it 's fun to play to pass time if you have it to waste . not awesome but not bad either .
the kids love . the loves it . the graphics are pretty good . what else can i say . i recommended you give it a try .
not to pleased with losing all progress due to an update . the game was great , but i wo n't be playing anymore after this .
very addicting game , the card at its some of the best , easy to learn and great set up for the action .
i freaking love this app ! there is nothing that i dont like about this app it 's all good . it 's so funny i use the music of the app to fall asleep lol .
i think this game is one of the best games i have played . i did not find one problem with this game
i love this game , great game so basic but so much fun . i love the speed and very easy to learn to play .
very fast action just like you are at the casino ... you win and lose big ! lot 's of fun you do n't realize how much time flies by .
it was hard to steer , and i wish i could control the speed somewhat . then it was just boring . i stopped playing the first day .
solutions are not unique . puzzles too simple . developer spent little or no time creating individual puzzles . also , colors used not appropriate for color blind users .
perfect for children its graphics are amazing my daughter now wants a pony for christmas . i love how they give you real activities you must do to care for a horse
did n't like this one all that much , love pinball , but did n't enjoy this at all , which is bad , because i was hoping it would be better .
this app works well and has n't caused a crash yet , i like as does my wife . i would get it again .
good graphics but the game cost too much for so short of a game . disappointed that it was so short . not enough for the money .
it is a super game to play . it is real hard to put down . i would recommend it to anyone who enjoys puzzles .
it fun to look up stuff but it really did n't have that much , i was looking up one thing and it took somewhere different so not that helpful just got it for fun any way .
i thought this was a kindle game bought it than could not download a little angry i purchase this one no recommendation didnt get to play
i thought this was something else . not for me ... . maybe a better understanding of the game was needed before i purchased it .
... since it was the free app of the day and i love it ! ! especially the list feature ! definitely highly recommended !
my husband and i travel often , i make sure i read the bible daily . i have this bible on my ipad and my galaxy 4. i have god 's words with me always . thank you !
there are so many games to choose from in this game , and i do n't see how anyone could ever get bored with it .
i am not a big fan of this app for the kindle fire hd . it seems lacking and slow in services . i do n't even use it .
i wanted an app that would allow me to find my kindle files . this does what it is supposed to do .
i think this is a nice way to relax . nothing exciting , but enjoyable . i would recommend this if you want to play but not concentrate .
so far so good , just wish the price was n't so high maybe soon they could make a full length game for free , i love all their games but would be broke buying everyone
this is a fun game . if you don , t play for awhile it uninstalled and you lose your coins . if this could be fixed it would be a five star game .
nice to be able to check facebook while at work or on the road . same features as the computer program .
fun and real life like but it takes forever to get any where in the game you literally have to buy into it to progress and get money to fix the house and stuff
this is a great game ... ... ... ... please keep this updated . it 's terrific for idle time & i love it . keep these games coming !
this game is great fun and it is perfect for all ages . in fact i might even say it is better for kids .
this game is great . it is so much fun to play . in fact it is very hard not to play it all the time .
fun to play when passing time or waiting for something . simple to play and it is free . the ads are easy to skip . get it .
fun , addicting . sometimes the ball does n't go where you want it to . otherwise its good . kindle fire compatible . play it all the time on mine .
works quickly and has a fairly good interface . the only problem i have is sometimes the controls freeze when in map mode , otherwise works well .
every game i play i get down to the last two word and get stuck , i ca n't figure out ho to reset them .
i love pandora . even with the ads its great and so many channels it allows you to make and keep . wonderful app and one of my favorites .
i like this game but unfortunately i do n't get the best results . i can play a long time just on luck .
this form of solitaire is both challenging and straight forward . i 'm glad it comes with instructions and an easy win choice .
my husband took this and did all the puzzles in less than 30 min . i like the pictures of the flowers but not the square format .
who does n't love zombies and killing zombies ? ! well it is a heck of a lot more fun when you get to do it with cute little plants .
i enjoy this game , however i keep having to reset it and reinstall it it 's just not reliable ... i hope they fix it
i love this app because it is addicting and i can never stop playing it ! it good for all ages and free and easy ! this is a game everyone should enjoy !
this is the same as temple run 2 - my granddaughter plays it and says it is ok. i have not played this game .
i love anything that has to do with food network , it makes my life more complete ! love the recipes , it makes for a good dinner every once in a while .
this app is so cool . i can barely get off it . do n't pay attention to all the bad reviews ; they 're mental .
i love anything that has to do with words . it is very engaging and i love it . i will definitely recommend this to everyone .
got this to help my little one learn how to count she loves it and plays with it every day
it was a fun game when i first bought it but very quickly it became boring . graphics are not that great .
this game is cool i love it some of them get hard but nothing you ca n't figure out just takes some creative thinking
great to have this available to check on my mail and contact with friends while traveling in area with wifi ... wish it was more like cell phone to get to web etc .
this app is great . i love watching old movies so this is right for me . so easy to use . and the selections are great .
it is a really fun game but is sometimes to understand what the next step requires . i eventually figured out as i went .
decent graphics and movement . difficulty level is appropriate and most puzzles can be solved . i enjoy playing this each evening .
great , fun game that involves strategy and a lot of thinking to solve each puzzle . it is a good challenge .
i had a lot of fun doing this game . there were lots of great activities . the interactive play was really quite good .
i 'm addicted ! love this game ! the more you play this game the easier it becomes , but each level is more challenging .
this is a really good app to help to learn to draw games well , celebrities . this is also a really fun app . i love this app .
not quite sure how all the aspects of the game work yet , but , so far it 's fun . we will see how much better or worse it gets as the game progresses .
the other checkers are stupid and boring but this one is actually normal . go ahead and download it its the best one yet
it is very challenging ! it takes a while to get through all the islands and each is so different . i love it !
i love this app i play it during church all the time and its a great time passer where ever you are or how old you are its just awesome
good concept , but the artwork for the objects is rather confusing . once you figure out what things are , it 's a rather fun little game . got it free so no complaints about the price .
this is a great game that keeps my partner and i entertained for a while . my children even like to help clear the blocks and guess the picture .
i do n't like that when you get stuck you are kinda out of options besides asking facebook but other than that it 's ok
this is a really fun game and i was surprised at the bonuses . the extra bingo cards help alot ! we need more games similar
it 's ok i guess but i really would n't know because you do n't even get to play the game before they ask you to rate therefore i only gave 2 stars
great app and so nice to use when reading on my tablet . thanks amazon for a great free app of the day !
i really really love this game but it is very addictive . i 've been on it over 2 hours now and ca n't put it down ! ! : )
i think this app is great it is so addicting and so fun . great app i love it get it
this is very entertaining . i love it . it is awesome . who is awesome ? this game right here . i love it . did i already said it ? whatever . buy this app .
i 'm not sure if this game has harder levels or not but the levels i 've played are impossible to lose . not much challenge really .
the best game ever and i play it about three or four times a day . it is easy to use
i enjoy this game when i am bored . it is entertaining and fun . love the power plays and it is not hard to collect .
pay close attention . be careful how you spend . all in all just another rpg . it wont bore you but it wont thrill ya either
this game is not angry birds , but it is awesome in its own right . its a very addicting and very fun game !
this game is so boring it is just not for me i give it a 2 star rank on my opinion
i found that this application was just ok. it provides the basics , and that is fine . i would like to see some improvements
everything that was fun about temple run but with more variety . more level variety , more power ups , more fun ! perfect kind of game for when you want to kill a few minutes , or hours .
i think it would be a little better if you could at least enter the houses . there could be a couple battles in each . or items .
i love the graphics . their amazing ! ! and since i love temple run or games related to it i knew this game would be perfect for me and it will be perfect for you too !
this app uses alot of my battery . but it is reliable . i use it all of the time . it 's loaded on a kindle hd .
i love this game i play it a lot it keeps me on my toes and fast action i love
the game wont play properly . i make a move and it never shows the other players move . glad i didnt have to pay for this
my son loves to just sit and have the app read this book to him ! i really like the fact that he has the choice to read it by himself !
i still have to learn more on it it is hard to understand i am very new at games so i need more time
its a fun game but i do n't like having to wait so long for things to finish unless i spend my own money . that 's why i left off 1 star .
this game is much more fun than it looks to be . typical mario clone type game but works very well on nexus 4 phone .
good game that makes you think but is n't so difficult to get frustrating . i found the concept interesting and entertaining .
it gets your brain thinking and exercises it . it 's fun trying to figure out the pictures and match the letters to the scene .
builds good problem solving skills . my 8 year old likes it as much as i do . works great on droid 2 .
i like that this game has auto click , and auto finish . it makes it much easier to play than other free games that make you drag each card .
this game is great for people who like challenges . you have to go through many different rooms trying to find a way out of the ship .
thanks to the developer for fixing the word list to show again . i enjoy playing this game , and requiring the letter in the center to be part of the words can be challenging at times !
some of the games are lame . but some are pretty addictive ... worth it for being free . better than most free games : )
i thought it would be fun to play a clue game for once in a long time since my childhood
oh this one is easy . who does not like angry birds ? now the pigs they are not so nice . i thoroughly enjoy this game . the seasons give you something cute to look at too .
my grand daughters love this game so much . they play it every time they come over . i highly recommend it .
unless you want to use your money to advance in game it is very slow moving forward , with some quests pretty much impossible otherwise good to help pass the time .
guess i 'm not very good at this . it did n't hold my interest and was bored with this game . not good at the slots in the casinos either .
it wo n't let me sync with facebook from my kindle . love the game from my laptop . help developers ! i want to spin .
where 's my water ? is beyond fun ! it is the best game in the world ! you can play this game for hours ! the controls are very easy to work . a must buy app !
get bored sometimes at work , and at home . love it ! comes in handy for young children also when they get bored .
this was a fun game did n't have to think very hard , so it was a fun time waster when bored with tv .
i love this game it has all of the robots in the movie and also they put in other robots to fight
works great on the kindle . it 's addictive and fun ! i 've played it through a few times and still find it to be my favorite time waster .
works like a dream ! does everything i needed and more ! keeps everyone in the family organized and informed . even syncs with my kids school calendar so i do n't forget when school is out .
great game and lots of fun . would recommend to anybody who loves to play the slots . great graphics . very addicting .
this seems to be a lot of fun . takes time to figure out the answer . can get the help needed from friends
boring ! i guess if you do n't have any other games to play - but i ca n't imagine that . it 's just boring .
an ok little app . works fine on droid x. it is simple , but interesting . it is a good time killer . good for kids . score history would be nice .
this game was n't a challenge at all . it was boring and did n't have anything interesting going for it . do n't play !
i have been unable to download it and am a bit frustrated . oh well , it was free and maybe it will work later on , , , ,
i got this app on my phone there were so awesome i love it . i can play it all day
i 've never played quell before and now i 'm addicted ! ! simple and easy to learn . the graphics look great on the kindle .
gets a little more difficult at each level . found out i needed a pen and paper at some levels but then again i 'm older than most of you .
it is entertaining and my grandaughter loves looking for the objects and the picture in general , would get other games like this
i play this every night before bed . pretty cool game figuring out the angles to kill the zombies and lots of screens .
so addicting ! ! love that you can share the puzzles you get stuck on to facebook for help ! ! love this app ... even paid for it to support the makers ! great job guys ! ! !
this helps with problems that you have during the game , you need a good memory or write the answer down for the problem when you ready to go back into the game .
i love this game there are so many levels , it is very challenging . i get to play all night long . great for anyone who loves matching .
this is okay , more fun probably for kids . not sure if i 'll actually play it much myself so i 'll just rate it as & # 34 ; okay & # 34 ; .
the video looks so cool i want it so badly i wish it was free or at least a dollar only
this game is very good . however challenging it may be , i enjoy playing this game . i would recommend this game to others .
what happened ? did you stop updating or what ? ? ? ? would like to continue , see where it ends . please update , so i can finish the game , if there is an end .
this game is somewhat of a challenge for anyone who has not done a lot of these type games . takes a while to get the hang of it .
it 's not my favorite game but i like it ok idk it 's a little boring to me i play it but
i just started playing and already its pretty scary . i love the mix of puzzles too . the length also is appreciated : )
so far this game has been fun and the and i like the story line and is easy to play .
one really fun and challenging puzzle game ! definitely worth $ 1 ! better than most puzzle games out there ! : ) most amazing puzzle game !
this will be a good way to clean out the bugs in my kindle . i think i will get the app right now it seems interesting .
this app is really fun but it started to slow down and my kindle would n't turn on a few times other than that it was really fun . and u should get it
this game is just like doodle jump but somehow the bottom of the screen is solid so you can never lose
best app ever that the only thing in can say like seriously . by the way the there 's a big boss at level 20
this sounds like a terrible game nice title but it sounds like it sucks so i am not getting it .
app says it 's for free but it really is n't . you have to pay it for each magazine . do n't recommend download it .
this game is much like the game clue . it takes you from one level to another . i would recommend this application to everyone who has a kindle .
this is a fun game . great pastime . challenging and fun . play for yourself and find out . any age will enjoy playing this game .
i happened to buy this app the day it was free , so , it 's worth more than what i payed for . is it worth $ 15 , heck no .
i love the speed of this game and the different cities and i love how you can use the money you earn for power ups .
it is challenging but fun too i got addicted fast but i wish you had a little more help or the song was longer
it is so cool i love it a lot so you play it it is so cool love it love it
i love this app ! it also works without wifi ! it 's fun if your bored and its not hard to get new characters and coins ! great app ! download !
this is a awesome game because i feel like it is a learning game and i love to learn at school and at home .
i just do n't spend as much time with this as i should . if the weather would get bad i might stay in side & work with it more .
crashes on nexus s 4g . shame , i got through a few pages and it seemed nice . it would be good if the description said that this is designed for a tablet
great - it is challenging and that keeps my brain active , sort of like games make to stimulate and keep mind active .
good job on this app , its worth the money , strong features and hd , i dont know why some gave this app a 3 or lower , i give it a 5 out of 5
good waste of time if i had to pay would not bother pretty much what it sounds like with a few cute features
its a good game . its a little challenging at times but its not too hard . i wish it was easier to get free hints though . : - )
i really like the game i just wish it had more story lines in it . i also wish kindle had the same version as the android market .
fun time killer . i 've only played single player mode , but is easy to learn and controls are straight forward and shooting up the other cars is a great stress reliever .
this game just did n't do it for me . i could n't seem to get it going right , though they said it was easy .
overall quite fun . i wish energy came back sooner and you did have to pay so much for the extra items .
i really like it but i think you should start off with more money and i think that they have too many buttons
i am a beginner . this was supposed to help beginners . didnt make sense at all . very hard to use . deleted it .
best sudoku i have played . though the backgrounds could be improved , the game itself is excellent ! ! ! i highly recommend this to beginners , novice , and advanced players .
i used to play this game when it was on ios but gave it up when i gave up my ipod , so now i 'm so glad it 's finally on android !
i cant believe that after this long i can finally get temple run on my kindle it is so great i am so happy
i 've gotten pretty addicted to this game , but it can get pretty tough without higher level cards that you have to buy
my 11 year old daughter got this game for her kindle fire . it is basically a game for very young children .
this game is a lot of fun . if you like bingo this is the game for you . i highly recommend this game .

it 's fun to play with family and friends . simple to follow , can move along as quickly as you would like to
this is great i love it .it has all my favorite shows from when i was a kid its great for my kindle fire .
i get tired of games really easily but this one i never get tired and it is way more fun than angry birds
it 's a fun game and instead of needing energy you need food to complete actions which i think is a much better system
this is definitely entertaining , and sometimes frustrating . the dialogue is awful , but sometimes you have to listen to it all for clues , so do n't skip it . worth the download .
this game of draw something is a lot of fun , my kids like to play it over and over again
this game is just like flappy wings it still is fun but a little bit harder so try it you will like it
just played it for a while and its fun . can get addicting cause i keep wanting to catch more fish .
too cool ... i could play this constantly . more of a challenge than i thought it would be at the beginning .
this game is awesome but i do n't like how ya have to purchase coins to buy stuff but its . funny
i feel that there was not enough explanation on how to play this game . therefore , i deleted it from my device .
i like the way the colors show you the words you 've found , as well as how they show in the list .
have so much fun same as one on face book , then works same , make your comics of your self and friend are so on lots of fun ! !

for very young kids . not adult game . to few of the seek items on each screen . would never have bought if i had listened to the other people 's feedback . will from now own .

i wish things could be better than what is comes out of it needs to be better for child to use
i just love the weatherbug . love how it tells you what the weather is in your area and gives up to 7 days of forecast
not bad , not outstanding . it gets several headlines on the screen for a quick look , but browsing when you have time is not so easy .
i really enjoy this game . the games have free spins and sometimes bonuses . colors are great and characters are great .
i love this game and play it as often as i can since i work all day
nice game . good challenges . do hope it gets a bit more difficult as the game progresses . at the moment a tad too easy .
it was free , so that makes it even funner . yes , i know funner is not a word . i am not an idiot .
take about addicting i like the the fact that u can see how far your friends are . wish it had more life 's but then i would be to easy .
it always crashes and never lets me post . i ca n't believe i even tried this again , such a waste of time .
this game . was a little too dark for me . i could not keep my attention for any long periods of time .

very easy to use and nice to have a calculator so handy . having it on my kindle for easy access is great .
idk about this game . it is ok but it does n't hit that very very fun mark . i do n't think so anyway . it was short and boring
i downloaded this to pass time . it turns out to be a pretty good app . highly recommend . if you enjoy slots
challenging and a fun concentration game . lots of fun to play ! i personally love word games anyway . hours of fun .
this book is n't very good . the quotes are nothing you 've not seen or heard before . i love great quotes so i may not be the best to give a good rating .
this was very frustrating for my child as there was nothing telling him anything about what was needed . he lost interest and he loves problem saving , but this gave him no hint to what the problem was .

awesome game . my only issue is that for me ... the clue doesnt always match the movie . but all in all , it is an amazing game .

this is one of the best games out there . i would play this all day if i had no school . lol

works perfectly on my kindle fire . easy to play and it fun . i played for about 10 minutes after i got this app . love it !
this game is fun to play with . it 's like you have your own little fish to breed , buy , and take care of .
my favorite android chess . fits well on my phone and tablet screen . they make great apps that work well . even their free versions are very nice with adds that do not distract too much .
this game is really fun and it really makes you think thank you i would like to see more fun stuff like this
this game is cute and fun , but there 's not much of a challenge . maybe my two and almost four year old nephews would like it .
this game is amazing . it is fast paced challenging and you can play with your friends . this game works on kindle fire .
this alarm clock does not word for me , i would not tell a friend , does n't work for me , complicated , would not choose it again
i loved it still enjoying it today . nice sequel . would recommend to all . it 's a must have
like angry birds . i shared it with my grandkids and they loved it . they are better at it then me .
this app is very helpful for minecraft ... it has everything you need ... i have a huge diamond block house and i have a huge gold house right next to it ... definitely would recommend this app
i just wanted to keep busy for as few minutes , but kept playing round after round . good for keeping your mind active .
this is such a great game ! it 's so much fun ! you can play the game without purchasing anything if you are patient .
did n't work for me . you pop one bubble and the app messes up . do n't waste your time . i was going to get this for my 2 yo . glad i tried it before him !
love how fast this app is on my kindle ! can jump between accounts quickly if you have more than one . try it you wont be disappointed !
description says it is compatible with kindle fire hd when it in fact is not . please fix this so that i can get it on my kindle fire hd .
ca n't always get to my desktop so i 'm glad this app is available for kindle fire hd also works well with my android .
really gets to be a challenge and makes me want to do the next level before i stop playing for the day
almost 5 just not quite there if they added more moves and characters it be great overall solid game i am not in love bit i am definitely satisfied
this was not for kids and was not good unless you wanted to check out the sounds and looks of guns
this would be a great game if it all worked . the bonus games do not work . the balls are not added every 30 seconds .
this is a pretty fun game its not one of the best but its ok would be good for younger kids
this app is one of the best apps for the kindle . i loved it so much ... it was money well spent .
not as good as some games , but does play well . i would recommend to anyone who just wants something to do .
fun and challenging . good to pass the time . better on larger screens . i need this for my kindle . fun to use .
stupid game , not worth your time or the memory on your phone . i do n't even use it . deleted it shortly after purchased
this is an entertaining game . i like the challenge and seeing how i rank against others . sometimes i wish it would give you a little more time to make words though but still a great game .
this is a highly addictive little game . it has a nice balance of strategy and luck . fun to come back to if you want to waste time .
i like the pet rescue saga . it is easy , but yet difficult at times . great for kids . i do recommend this game .
this is mostly for children . i do n't care for it . maybe someone could come up with harder tiles with letters and game symbols .
this is a good app if you like logo games . it makes it kind of easier by giving you letters to choose from . just buy the app and see !
this is my very favorite game . it would be a lot dinner if the weapons were cheaper or we earned more money . but otherwise it 's very fun
my daughter loves this ( she is 3 ) . she is learning though she does n't know it . i like that there are different learning areas .
i personally like traditional art and i suck at digital but with app what i draw actually looks pretty good . i would recommend to anyone ! : )
if you look at the permissions , you will see that this app is able to access your exact location using wifi and gps ... why does a flashlight need to do this ?
i did n't play it . this was chosen by a small child . she did n't quite understand it . i did n't take the time to check it out . no comment one way or the other
haha this game is awesome i have been waiting forever for this and it has finally came out i 'm so happy
i couldnt open this program . so it may be good but i dont know . is there a way to see before i down load ?
it is okay , not for me really , and do n't like the slots they have , maybe will be better when i play it more
fun to play when you are stuck at the dr office with your kid . need five more words to be done .

this is good very busy and a lot of our business is done through mail so i never get behind
it was not what i was looking for so i really did n't use this app . might have been a good app , just was n't what i was wanting
this app has a lot of fun and very interesting games on it and i thought it was the most fun i have had .

i especially like that you just have to touch a card to move it unlike the other solitaire game i have on my kindle also from amazon .
i was really happy to see that this game was finally on kindle . this game is fun and addictive ! you wo n't be able to put it down !
this game is great i played some zombie game on an iphone similar to this but this game is much funner i got it for my kindle fire its funny too everyone should get this game
the game is addicting but it stopped loading on my kindle and takes up too much space on my phone to download .
decent game so far as i can tell . i am not impressed with the fact that you have to pay after ten doors .
too many reminders on main page . do not have facebook so cant get hearts . need more land more quickly . cant find scratch in my village .
i love minecraft . my friend got me interested and i got it for the xbox 360 , one of the first apps i asked for as soon as i got my hd .
son is having a blast . there are some parts that are frustrating but as games go it is fun to play . wish that had a beginner / easy selection .
i was hoping to find some sort of norton protection for my kindle fire and was thrilled when a friend told me about this .
never heard of some of the companies . and spelling counts which makes it a bit harder but i like it ok .
i loved this at first until i had to spend real money to advance into the fun stuff . i get why games do that i guess but maybe an option to earn stuff would be great ?
this is a good version of mahjong , it has numerous layouts to choose from . the only thing that i had a hard time with was telling which tiles were free to move .
this is a great app to have , always available at your fingertips to watch whatever you like when you want to watch . so glad i was able to install this app .
this is a fun little game to have to pass the time . there are cool things to do and it is educational in some aspects .
does a great job . so happy to have it on all kindles . ever one should have one on all their kindles .
i did n't like this app at all . i even think i paid for it . it was confusing to use and i felt like i was getting second rate news .
this is more like what i was looking for to take notes at meetings and a bit hard to get used to .
not my favorite slot game but its good to pass the time . need more points like every slot game . end
what a awesome app this is a cool an fun game it 's like going to the arcade . everyone should play this game .
this seems like a fun game just wish it would load a little faster but still fun thats why i gave it a 4 enjoyed it
right from the beginning i did n't like it . it was boring and i could n't get mind into it.i had to quit .
enjoy the slot games ! like that there are so many different slot games to choose from . payouts are good and there is an hourly bonus to help keep you going !
i love this app it makes possible for two of my other apps to word flawlessly . trouble without it . thanks .
i bought this for free before , but now its .99 cents ! ! ! other than that , its pretty cool , except for controls

i 've played this card game when i was young . it is still as much fun as i remember . try this fun game . i 'm sure it will be addictive once you give it a try .

i have been waiting for this game for forever ! it has for so long only been on apple and android products . i love this game so much ! great fun easy for all ages ! : - )
neat way to keep track of your battery status . have n't had any problems with it on my kindle fire . fun to play with .
i love thus app because there is different difficulty levels . the categories are great and its always a challenge ! great for all ages ! ; )
its time consuming . i get addicted because it 's fun . there is n't much too it and it 's easy to learn how to play .
i was not a big fan of this as it did n't meet all of my needs and was n't as user friendly as i would have liked .
i was so excited to see this app finally free but it was to short i finished it in 30 mins ... fun but short
i was n't sure if i would enjoy it but i soon discovered that it was different than any other game that i had downloaded .
very addicting game , very easy to play and smooth ! i have n't found any problems at all ... . hopefully it will stay that way .
i watch animal planet all the time and this will be great for when the power goes out or we are just waiting for more things to happen
after seeing the cute picture , i downloaded the game . i was disappointed . the game was confusing . i probably wo n't continue to play it .

i find this app to be extremely accurate and i recommend it to everyone this is the best app ever !
just could n't get into the game . just not my kind of game to begin with . do n't know what else i can say .
fun to play in free time . get it i mean its free why not ? ! ? ! the only downside is that you need wifi to play it but its great and a fun game to play !
i love this app ! it is addictive and fun , but it also has different ways that you can play . i like the training option , but also the one where you play for chips .
wonderful way to pass the time . and an easy way to learn new words as well . loads quickly . never had a glitches with this one . highly recommend this one . )
this is a nice application however the interface could use a bit more work . i prefer the website or the iphone app .
great game . graphics are good , sound is kind of cheesy , and the game party is awesome . great start to a good game .
the because i like trying to solve puzzles and how to get out of the game it is hard and easy
this is a challenging game after the first levels . do n't use up your hints ! they are hard to get as you reach higher levels .
this app kept locking up on my tablet and phone . when it did work i liked it , but it caused more problems than it helped .
i think this game is awesome ! ! ! it 's really fun to play and very cute . i would recommend this to anyone who likes fun games
i really love this game it has such beautiful graphics keeps you very busy once you start playing you do n't want to put it . down

son got this game but he and i really do not like it at all . reaction time with the game is slow .
i liked it . its challenging but not too tough . kept me busy for awhile . not bad for an escape game .
this is ok. same as all the others like this , nothing really pops out that makes me say it 's better than any other similar app . go ahead and take a look .
netflix at your fingertips , how nice is that . this app makes it easy to watch netflix from your phone or tablet .
the game is fun addicting and challenging . even when you reach the finish , you can keep playing for the highest tile .
it is a trivia game and it is really fun i think you might need a brain to do this
very fun hide and seek game . i do recommend this one to all android users . being free app makes it that much more appealing .
ice age is a color full fun enjoyable game that you can play totally free if you have the patience to wait for your acorns to accumulate or if you prefer you can purchase . them for fast building .
this game is way better then temple run . i just love this game ! who would n't love it . every body should
i don not use this ap . too much trouble . i thought it would be handy . but paper and pencil works best for me .
i enjoy the hidden object games and this one for the tablet is really nice and i liked it a lot .
this is entertaining . not difficult at all . nice to pass time with when waiting for an appointment or other such event .
like the idea , but when i get to one i do n't know or ca n't solve , it stops me there and wo n't let me go on . very frustrating .
enjoyed it very much , had some problems seeing the items but that made it more of a challenge and that 's what i liked .
i could play this game all day if it was only possible . i have so much fun playing it that it is the first thing that i do once that i have all of my other work done .
super simple . i wish i could make list in side of list , but it does n't allow you to do so . works for simple grocery list , but i 'm better with pencil and paper ... .
this is an interesting game and i like it but i do n't understand it that well . i would recommend to give it a try
the carnival game i enjoyed as a child is now on my tablet . it is great fun and helps with my hand and eye coordination .
just because candy is in the name does not mean it is like candy crush saga . this is nothing like that game .
i have only used the app for a day and it seems like a good application . i only wish my community had more local ads on the app .
it is a good game . just make sure you think ahead as far as moves and how much time you have to play . you will forget about time
this word search is suitable for casual or more challenging use . letters are easy to read and time length given is fair . most enjoyable of recent similar apps .

really great game . well worth the price . cute character . i did find it was easier to play if i used a stylus .
i did not care for this game at all . it seemed very childish to me . do n't buy this one . that 's just my opinion ! ,
this game is fun and the new layout is awesome . very fun and entertaining . anyone who likes sudoku will like this version .

i love it a lot ! i love to draw so this is a good way to do it on my kindle .
great game . love i can start over if i want to . was a little hard to get started at first but became addictive fast .
this app is not bad or anything it 's just that you do n't need this app . i mean you can just go to silk and search it there . thats all .
this game was a lot of fun . i love hidden object games . the scenes and picture quality are wonderful . big fish makes high quality games , reasonably price . i highly recommend there games .
its ok but it would be better if there were more ways to get coins and the hints were more specific
wish i was better at drawing . and wish more of my friends played this game . oh well , it was fun when everyone was playing .
this app helps me talk to any of my friends anywhere i want to ... ... ..i love this app so much ! ! ! ! ! x x
love this game . very mind challenging . love that it gets harder each level . still easy enough for kids to use as well .
like this as it is relaxing and also allows you to use your mind . easy and fun . would reccomend this to anyone who loves to do puzzles ! fun and challenging .
this could be a good game if you were given some directions but without hints you ca n't figure out what is next . not even good as a free game .
but when it uses the flash from my camera , i would n't call it tiny ! ! it 's the only flashlight app i 've ever been impressed by . definitely a keeper ! ! !
this is one of the games that i play the most . it is very entertaining and will keep your attention for quite awhile .
i love this app . it syncs with google for me . i like that i can choose which calendar to have events show up on .
please update ! but great game ! buy it its will never end ! addictive and awesome fun for it children also great price ! ! ! !
omg i luv this game ! ! ! best game ever . but i hate when i run out of coins . my question is how do u get the gems for free ( without paying for them ? )
this game is a great game and i love playing it all the time . having this game is great when i 'm going somewhere since i can just upgrade something and go to the place .
just like on the big machines , you 'll find this does what it 's supposed to do , and does it well . no complaints here .
alot of fun ! really love the designs and creativity put into the game play . challenging and could be played by any age .
i enjoyed playing this app . the random puzzles make you think which makes this app game better than a regular seek and find .
a great way to challenge yourself and waste some time . sometimes frustrating but always enjoyable . i would recommend this game to my friends
way more easier then others and i found it fun for me and a bit almost funny can i say i laughed at my self
it is not a complicated game , but it can be challenging enough at any level . i is a great way to sharpen your brain .
would give it a 5 but some of the food takes to long . love the game and the concept get it !
i 've become addicted to it as much as candy crush . i ca n't stop myself from playing it . yes i have become one of those people i thought i 'd never be .
i am addicted . i can set and look for hours . there are so many great ideas on here . i just need to find enough time to try them all .
the game is excellent in providing many hours of fun and enjoyment for either multiple people or a single player . this helps to develop more word power .
fun , entertaining , and great play time ! ! ! ! ! try it out and you wo n't be able to put it down : ) good graphics and interesting quests .
great fun and the quick video for free points is nice . new gamers can learn quickly . highly enjoyable ! the graphics are great and there are many levels of play .

solitaire has always been a great way to pass the time . this is a great app . great way to get your mind off other things .
quick and easy access to well chosen verses . very convenient . would like to see verses in new american standard version .
love this game , just wish you could level up quicker . love the mini game . i will keep this on my device for a long time .
i would n't say it is as good as the original but it is great it is like 3d and i love the games it has they are awesome
i think if they would have put mobs ( like animals or monsters ) in it that would have made it better .
great game . not as great as the original flappy bird , but is pretty good . great game , i definitely recommend it .
everyone should play this game ! i have played other bingo games and this one is the best by far ! you will love it ! !
this game is fun . and i think it 's cool that they added new things to this game . i want to play this game all day
a very handy app . multiple items in on app , takes up less space on desktop . very useful , glad i got it .

awesome app i love it so much it is so awesomely awesomeness and the great app is awesome happened to play app
love this game . it plays easily and its not heard to learn . it has no glitches . the only bad thing is its highly addictive .
i played this game a lot when i got it . now i play other mahjong games but i still come back to this one .
i do n't usually review , but this game was pretty cool and said i should . overall i was satisfied and this game was something to do when i 'm bored .
i had a hard time at this and it was real brain teaser . need to have patience and time to complete the levels .
this app is so sick , been playing for five minutes and have been loving it . reccomended to anyone who likes guns
it works well on the kindle but i would recommend a separate keyboard to make it easy to type documents .
i have a 3 year old grandson who loves to play this game . i like the game but have not had a chance to play it .
reminds me of the old atari system . that kinda tells my age . have n't played much but it is fun . works well on kindle fire .
i liked the first where 's my water better . this one had too many additions , like special tools . i guess i just do n't like change .
once i got to a certain level and i cant get past it but it 's a cute game to play
i saw my brother playing it so i wanted to try it but it would not download plz fix this bug asap ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
i can finally text my friends . we are working on a project so it comes in handy . get this app !
this is a great game , enough going on to keep your interest and nice graphics . i have had no problems with it either .
i used to not be able to play the game at all , force closing frequently . the latest update fixed this problem along with changing the physics . major improvement .
this is a great game and lots of fun . it challenging enough to keep your interest yet not too challenging to cause frustration .
people are saying that you cant update this app but just uninstall it and reinstall it and it works perfect .
i would like to thank the creators for making this fun and challenging game . i completely recommend this addicting game . download this .
this game is challenging and fun . the graphics are pretty good . i do wish there was a way to earn free hints during game play .
must have this app . once i started playing it i ca n't stop . would recommend this app to everybody it is fun
very addicting and fun ! i have n't been able to put it down ! i have to fight my son for it ! kidding ! definitely a thinking game .
its a great game its easy to learn anybody can do it i think its good its great great great great great great great
the game of life is really fun and awesome and good graphics for a kindle game i love this game its worth the money
this is a great game , but the controls for steering on the kindle fire are very sensitive , that is the only reason for the 4 stars !
this game seems like it would be fun but you really cant see the stuff your looking for maybe because of color
the game itself is fun , but it freezes up on my kindle to often that i do n't really care to play it .
fun to play , easy to figure out , good graphics , good sound effects . i would recommend to people who enjoy pinball
very neat game . lot of content for a free app . i recommend it to anyone who likes being in charge of something . i have n't encountered any bugs . cool app .
this is a fun game additive and entertaining would recommend this game to friends and family the graphics are cool and funny
for free , this is a great app . allows me to see what programs are taking up the most memory and to easily force stop them if i would like
fun app . especially like the fact that you can play it with being connected to the internet and connect if when u want
it was a good game until it started with ads . then it had issues like starting over and going back to the same page i had just finished . i liked playing it til then .
fish farm is not my cup of tea , was ordered for my grand daughter when she spent the week end with me .
really great game . this is the first time that i have played it . something like diner dash and just as great .
since i am a big fan of christmas he really enjoys all the different pictures this book has . not to mention the quality time we spend together .
i downloaded this game thinking it would not be all that great . but i was wrong . it is both challenging and nicely detailed graphics to boot .
not my favorite game . slow moving through each board . not enough of a tutorial to help me . so no fun .
loved it wish there were more levels , once i play it it was over ... .. would give it a 5 if more levels ...
this game is ok but they should make more free levels . the mystery duck should be .99 cents not 2.99
this may be a good app on a full size computer but i do most of my research on my tablet . this app does not work properly for my needs .
i really like this app . i can save photos , music , documents all in one place . it 's easy to use . i really like being able to create my own folders to stay organized .
i am not great at riddles and only just started . so far i find it challenging and interesting . no problems .
every thing is pretty much locked . is is very realistic , however . but overall it would be cut for young children . ( if they are into it )
daughter loves it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! : - ) ! ! ! ! ! ! : - ) ! ! ! what more show i say !
alarm is easy to use . i like that it has the weather feature . good alarm sounds to choose from . nice clock .
lots of fun ! has many challenging levels . this game could use more levels . great graphics ! this game is very very addictive .
totally enjoy interaction of this game and chat feature to communicate with friends and family who live far away , and have met new friends
i love this game its not too hard and not to easy just put together well enough to keep you occupied
great free app . could use an undo button . but it was free so who 's complaining ? get this app . you will love it !
this game is very addictive i have a hard time not playing it everyday ! ! if you do n't have this game you should get it now ! !
fun to play . makes you think . moves fast . i love the games like this one . keep them coming . educational as well . the whole family can play along
i would not buy this game it 's boring and never ends , no point or challenge to it . if you want to be challenged then this is not the game for you
my grandson loves the game as do i. i find myself wanting to play the game every time i have a few minutes to spare .
this is kind of hard and not that fun but passes time i guess . would not let me get to level two so it has some issues .
my kids love this game . even the 5 year old is better at it than i am , and i 'm a video freak !
it 's a great idea but my daughter was bored in 2 min . plus the mistakes in the program should be fixed .
this game is really fun . the only bad thing is that you have lives and you have to wait for some time till you can play again
me and my brother tried to download it but it did n't work also it takes forever just to load a level up
i think it looks very nice but that 's about where it ends at least for me . i removed it within days . just was n't for me .
this game is a lot of fun and very challenging . it makes you think as to what each picture has in common .
overall this game is fun . not really anything especially good or anything . but it is kind of fun . i like it .
fun relaxing , no pressure , nice graphics , do n't have to buy anything but the game . i could live without finding the differences , otherwise fun game .
nice mix of creating a town and fighting the bad guys . a good game for a wide range of ages .
this game is sooooooo fun i am a boy and i love this game i think it is fun for all boys and girls
i was n't what i wanted and i had to purchase the full version key to get it to work . i wish i knew i would be happy with before i purchased the key .
i 'm not crazy about this game . i 'm older and like more of the card games and things to keep my mind going . my grandchildren love this game . so do many other people .
this is a wonderful version of the angry birds series . wish they had more ! finished all levels , all stars , etc .
i just thought i would try it out and found that i do n't like the speed of the game . it shows advertisements after each game .
i do n't get this game . maybe kids would like it . very boring ... not at all challenging . wish they would rate these games .
love this game , but it is very addicting . just wish it had an info button as most games do to explain the levels and options . it 's a great way to pass the time .
if you are a fan of diner games you should get this game . even if you never played a diner game before i promise you that this is a great game and i think everyone would love it .
graphics are superior and gameplay is awesome ! ! one of the best apps i have played ! i highly recommend downloading this game .
if u like sports games this is the game for u like the person said below me this game has some great graphics
this kept me busy for some time . i looked at comic books for a little while . i enjoyed it and read some free ones .
just started playing . it 's interesting so far . it froze a few times , but i just exited and started again . i 'm going to keep playing for now .
i don not have the original so i can not compare but this game is nice and better than jewel
my fault i did n't read the description well enough i though it was more of a logic puzzle than just a puzzle .
this app was fun and i am enjoying the adventure , thanks for your creativity on the app and mini games .
fun game , however , did n't play for 2 days , but was the highest battery drain on my device . what 's up with that ? uninstalled .
i like this game and played it often , until i found another one called backgammon free which i like a little better , better graphics .
not that entertaining but its good when you very bored but when you are bored , you could probably get way better free apps like fruit ninjas : )
this app is fun to play with . good time killer . only thing i would change is being able to save designs .
i ca n't get enough ! it 's just like the real deal except i 'm in the privacy of my own home or anywhere i want to play ! thanks again kindle fire !
i really like that i was able to start playing with no trying to figure it out . timer and auto finish are great features .
i really could not get it to work for me on my kindle . it might have been something else but i could not play it very well .
it has very little action and theres only 4 cars plus there is only one track i want more tracks more cars
this game could be played for hours and is so cheap . moms if your kids want something get this . this is the best and i move it .
i love this game but it is really challenging . this took me a long time to do the first puzzle . like i said very hard but will get better the more i play .
cant advance past the stupid rock . hint is useless . just keeps doing the same thing ! there should be a reset function or something !
it is fun so far . my five year old daughter was even able to guess a couple questions . i am only 6 questions in so far , but so far so good .
best game ever ! very addictive and fun . my entire family loves it . so download it . although do n't download the free version it ai n't free
the number of stars given by others show that i will not pay for the app . i pay only for apps that have 4 stars or better !
this is a really fun game ! the only downside is having to buy extra cards to finish some of the rounds .
this game takes a while to load and its good but not the best out there , but at least its free .
just ok. you have to think but you move along quite slowly . is it challenging ? that 's as matter of opinion now , is n't it .
it works like it is supposed to . it is easy to use . the price is very good . it is a video camera too .
the app was not what i expected . the trivia really was n't good . i wish that it was more of a brain training type of trivia .
violent ? is there blood in this game . can a little kid play it or is it too much for them
hate it ! all u do is play with a person on ice and press buttons ! it 's a waist of your time do n't get it ever !
it is a very helpful app . i think it is a good way to find out what is on tv .
it 's great to find an where you can download free music : ) listen to the saved list w/ o a wifi connection .
it gives great hints if you just think them through . can not go to the next one if draw a blank and need to go to another song and then go back .
was never ever able to really play it maybe i just could never figure it out you may have better luck then i did but i did not have any luck
this game is pretty good in all ways but i do n't like how the screen turns when ur gon na throw the ball
omg i love this , it runs perfectly , amazing graphics and so much fun . id totally pay money for this . glad its free though !
i like the app that gives videos about what is going on in the world . this one does not do that .
would like to see high scores . why do you need your name if it does n't keep track . it really works your brain . love it .
my phone died so i decided to get a texting app and i was very smart to get this . great notifications and hd graphics it is simple to use and is quick .
my nephew loves playing this on my kindle , make sure you do n't have in app purchases on as i learned that the hard way . but other than that , it is good and keeps the kiddos entertained
the random mahjong is one of my favorite mahjong games . it is a lot of fun to play and has a lot of screens t play .
i get to distract the young ones and its entertaining for them . there has n't been any glitches lately , so its been working pretty well .
great game is easy to play and understand . would recommend to anyone that likes to play slot machine games that do n't like to wait a long time for bonus coins .
i have n't played myself but the kids are loving it and that is why i got it for them . yeah
you know the answer but do you really know the answer ? it 's challenging and yet easy . it takes time to think and yet you might not still get it wrong .
great game , i would recommend this game to everyone . good story and a great way to spend your time . i ca n't wait to try the other games in this series .
my youngest is four , and he thoroughly enjoyed it . i was interested in the full version , but i could not see and upgrade price . i thought this very odd .
very fun game but you have to pay to keep going . i would have loved more levels for free . worth buying . graphics are good .
love this free game ! very easy to get into and start . my son likes to try and catch the animals that run in . overall fun and great game !
great game , tons of fun , i just wish there were more opportunities to use bananas for purchases instead of coins all the time . fun for kids and adults !
it is just garbage it 's basically unplayable and they have a bunch of games by same developer that are exactly they the same do n't waste time .
this app is similar to facebook but in my opinion i think it is better and also has a way better lay out and format of how they do things and how things work and run .
i have n't had much time to mess around with this app , but it seems to be a lot of fun . i look forward to working with it more .
i love this game . its interesting and challenges the mind with different ways to find objects . i love the story line as well like the game clue .
there is tournament play or individual . they have interactive fun boards and challenging prizes . it is fun and the time element makes it fun and challenging .
great game . i have the microsoft version on my laptop computer and i play it almost everyday . i love playing the classic version of this game .
fun game ... ... .if you just want something to do and to pass the time for just a few minutes . i like it ...
really awesome game i really like it . it teaches about responsibility for younger kids or older you can race clean
this game is full of interesting challenges and i enjoyed playing the different levels . i think a lot of people would enjoy this game .
good game - thanks for making it available . and i would recommend it to everyone who has time to play .
this is the most addictive game i have played . i ca n't stop . ca n't wait to see what the levels bring . hope not disappointed .
its very addictive and i enjoy playing it the levels keep you going and they are interesting to complete . love it a lot
this app is cool but i am 11 and some of the logos are really hard . but over all its pretty fun !
this is very convenient for when you are away from the house to make sure you do n't miss your shows .
it is fun and challenging for all ages . my four year old enjoys the lower levels and i enjoy it all !
if you have played any of the angry birds games this is a great game to add to the collection .
this app is really fun at first but gets a little repetitive i like the different races and characters but not very detailed
if you like movies and want to spend a few minutes using your memory , this is a very good way to do it
i like this game because it 's colorful which holds my attention and it 's fun to have payouts that are fun and exciting - cute also .
i did n't mean to download it again . i already have it several time . sorry , i made a mistake . now just let me delete .
my grandchildren enjoyed this game but we had to buy more options for it to be very good . after that was better .
it 's really fun for little kid s lol my kid knows how to play it and i do n't know what they teach me
awesome game and it starts to get addicting but not to me i play it like 2 time a day
i love the game it is great you should by it it is totally worth being around in this world . it is such a cool game . i am happy the kindle fire is around .
our entire family loves this game . it is easy and everyone down to the youngest grandchild can play with this awesome game .

this piano master christmas app is a great time waster and a lot of fun to fool around with . i just love it !
this is a really good app and i think you should get it because it is a great way to spend time .
this was actually better than i expected . a little cheesy but a good game & it held my interest . will play the next one .
most of the movies wo n't load for me . i had this app for only a few days before deleting . too limited in selection and poor at loading .
its fun you get a free spin every 3 hours . i wish you got the hinton bucks a little more often .
great game for all bingo lovers everywhere ! ! ! give this a try as it is challenging and fun for all ages . go ! ! bingo ! !
fun to play , lots of big pay outs . great graphics and color . the best slots i 've played . make more slots games with big pay outs .
i downloaded this for a little girl who was visiting and she seemed to enjoy it very much . she had her granny write the title so her mother could get for her to play at home .
love this game it is so fun ! it makes me laugh and that is a good thing . it 's easy to learn and fun for all .
this game is loads of fun . i just cant stop playing . the graphics are stunning , so colorful and clear . i love it .
pretty good graphics and skill levels recommend others to give it a try . better than most zombie related games i have tried
great app ! ! i looked at many before i downloaded this one . quite satisfied , extremely nice that it is free too ! ! !
i love playing this game . i see why it is 5 stars . if i were you , i would get it .
fun app with a lot of different slot games to play . many ways to play and win . also many offers to get coins .
this is so easy to use and has everything you need . others that i have tried did not even have a percent to use .
i enjoy looking at it . have n't had to use it for anything , not sure if i will keep it . do n't do much flying anymore
this game 's hardest level is level 19 in chapter 3. it is sort of a horrible game.i do n't like this game that much .
thought it was too easy so deleted it after first try . was colorful and should be for children about 10 years old .
fun game . my grand kids really love it . they want to play it whenever they come over to see us .
extremely additive just wish the payout for work and everything would be a little more but that makes me stay on to keep earning
again ... .this one did not hold my attention like the magic jigsaw puzzle app ... not as many options and pictures were poor quality .
find this game to be interesting it challenges your eye coordination powers to figure how to find the missing items
i like the animation of the game . it keeps my attention and keeps me wanting to play more . way fun game of bingo
i loved all the puzzles and hope you put on more and larger ones . they were great to put together .
so it 's a good game but keeps having to force close on my kindle fire when they update it it will be the best game on my kindle .
this is a fun app . i ; highly recommend this . i have enjoyed it alot . you can draw things and take notes .
it is a good game . i just wish that the game makers would make it easier to get gold . other than that it is a good game .
this is a pretty okay game . the graphics are amazing . i like the way gamers seem to enter from the street .
parents they have bad clothes i would say for a 13 year old . i just do not like it for me a 8
my daughter enjoys the game though you have to spend alot of money for the added features to play game .
my granddaughter loves this game when she comes over that 's what she plays , she is trying to teach me , it takes time
i play with computer and is a good challenge . gives good practice for playing other players . this is a family favorite .
i 'm still in the free version and enjoying this game a lot . the story line is interesting and there are not a lot of hog scenes which is fine with me . nice graphics too .
wow , let me just say this app is amazing . i highly recommend you to get it because its a fun app and its really addicting .
the . game is fun and very hard to figure out the words . but it is fun to play the game and it is worth getting the game for free
it is an alright pass timer but does n't give you much options . actual card game is more fun to play .
my kids love this game and play it all the time . i have been known to play it as well , the only problem is , once you start you ca n't stop !
i love this game i really do , but it 's really difficult to get weapons and armor without buying it with real money / :
this is one of the best games ever . the graphic update really had an effect on it and the multiplayer is awsome
it would n't work on my kindle fire hd . i tried everything i could think of . nice idea , but a waste of time .
i really like this solitaire app . unfortunately , it has become very addictive for me since i waste much time playing it .
just started playing today and downloaded all the games . no real money necessary to play but i do need neighbors . fun !
had it two days . now wo n't even load . if i reinstall , i 'll loose every thing i build . not a memory problem on my device .
i usually do n't play or like games like this one , but it was faotd , so i got it and it is great ! it has tons of levels and is very entertaining .
i love this . app is so awesome i mean its tree 's plus its like you take ' n care of a pet or a living thing ! ! ! ! ! !
i use this app every day and the format is great . it 's quick to find the news i seek and i always find other news i was n't aware of . stay informed !
fun game young kids can play several types of sharks a lot of fish to eat ... and other sharks its fun try it out
this game is fun to play . sometimes it seems difficult to guess the word until you start using the help letters . then you feel dumb because it is so obvious .
i enjoy playing mahjong and this format is really cute and fun . nice colors and symbols . if you like to play mahjong , you will enjoy this version .
might be nice if it stated it needed a wifi connection in the description . visiting family and not around wifi till i go home now have to sit with this in my bar till i can download it .
i had this app on my ipod touch before and loved it ! so glad its now on the android and free today on amazon app to boot !
so far anyway hope i can keep going . i am playing on my kindle . having way too much fun with games .
i think this game is super fun and it even helps me spell ! you should definitely download it . it is a better version of scramble and its free ! ! ! !
it is quite challanging . i watch many movies but really had to think . some of the graphics are not very clear .
not great , not terrible . does n't save your high scores - only fills the top spot . long way to go just to be rated good . hoping for improvement soon .
i will have to monitor his access but we will enjoy the movies too ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! thank you ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! we would not change anything .
this is a really fun game . i ca n't get past level ten ; it seems almost impossible . this is not a good game for people who have anger issues .
this app sucks and is just a copy of temple run . temple run is way better , plus its free . get temple run and save yourself a dollar .
fun game . like the offer of 100 coins for a review ! more challenging than the first set but in a good way .
best game ever i would like the freezing to stop though when i got it i was addicted to it and i still am
great game for kids and adults too . i really love watching my daughter get into this game and have fun learning ! !
good questions and categories -- some are very difficult and some pretty easy . graphics are good . would recommend this ap to anyone who likes the jeopardy show or a challenge .
use this app , more with the smartphone . get movie on the ride home .
you got ta give it a shot . take a bit of time to get to know it . this is really one unique game .
im addicted ! love this game . play it all the time . recommend it for all ages . fun for the whole family .
this an ok game , i think it always good to have a few extra challenges , i was n't sure what to expect .
this game is fun and addicting . i love that i get to compete with real people and not the computer . my boyfriend likes to play against me too which makes it more fun
this game is so fun and challenging ! it is also addicting , so be careful : ) my four year old sister likes to play it and my 19 year old sister and my mom !
the review stated it would teach piano . when i downloaded it a piano keyboard popped up but no instructions and no way to get out of it . deleted it .
it is necessary for anyone who uses their phone frequently and has multiple accounts . it creates passwords for you our saves your own .
such a great game to play when at work ! would recommend it to anyone who wants to pass the time !
super cute and tons of fun . great graphics & challenging levels . worth the money . i 'll be sad when i get all the levels , ca n't wait for new ones
this game is okay , have n't played it much . however , for the most i played it great . get you use to playing high with really dollars .
my niece likes this program . i have not seen it yet , but she says it is fun to use , so i trust her on that .
great little game . i think my granddaughter will love it . i even like it . it was free cant complain about that .
love this game . its so much like the actual show . love that i can compete against my facebook friends . you should definitely get this app . you will love it !
not very exciting , but my son loves it , so it 's a keeper . it 's easy to use and beautiful to look at .
this game is kind of boring does not keep your interest in the game . however the graphics are pretty peaceful along with the sounds .
i gave this rating because it was a good game . i like this game . it was as they had described it
i downloaded the & # 34 ; offline & # 34 ; bible to use when i could not connect to a wireless system and it worked great ! thanks for the easy use and offline versions available .
if you like bingo blitz , you will love the fast paced action in bingo rush . challenge and fun all in one game !
just downloaded and seems like fun . different from other bubble popping games . i would recommend downloading this game if you like these kind of games
this is a entertaining and actually quite challenging game as things progress . it 's really fun and i come back to it often .
seemed interesting ... ... but really was n't . there really are n't any cameras worth watching . i just deleted it . not sure why all the other reviews were so good .
keeps you wanting the next part of the story . get this game . just like the pc hidden object games . good storyline .
fun game . i prefer this game too candy crush . it is similar to another game i used to play where the bubbles kept dropping . this game is less stressful , though .
great way to spend a few hours . i only have it 4 stars because it was n't long enough . if they add to the game i 'll give it 5 .
i love it but first i thought it was about doing missions like walking and stuff like that but whatever i totally recommend this app to iron man lovers ! : d especially that gameloft made this ! !
i like the game but i dont like how much it cost to get a new game everytime . over all the games are cool .
i can not connect to google from here and my account on my phone is on google not facebook so its annoying for that , but the gameplay is great . recommended it 's very addictive
its kinda easy but its also kinda hard at some point . plus its just to simple then it becomes way to hard
this game goes at just the right speed for seniors to keep up . i 'm a bingo junkie and play several games on my kindle , but this is a favorite .
very easy to read and it has every book ! and it breaks it down into each category . i love it . always at your fingertips . thanks so much .
the controls are awful . the game is worth what i paid for it . which is nothing . do n't waste your time getting this app .
it down loaded nice to my fire and the graphics are good . keeps you wanting to come back for more
this game is so awesome ! it does n't slow down or freeze and i 'm completely addicted to it . i play it everyday !
wow i would totally recommend this game to other people . the storyline is the best i 've seen and it keeps me hooked
on my kindle fire it keeps closing on me right in the middle of playing . i would like it if it would stay on
i love the app , if only i had more money to play longer . just like the casinos , just move on .
this is a great game it 's kinda like the old pokemon i would recommend this game if your up for a challenge
the google keyboard does everything this does and is included on most devices . also , it looks better in my opinion .
finally on amazon ! i love this app ! when you play this game everyday you zoom through it but i still love it ! totally reccomended !
this is definitely a great application . everything you need from the web version , but made for a tablet or mobile device . glad i got it .
i love playing this game at any time . the cards move well and the game is easy to play . it is a must have game !
very useful . it 's nice to have it on my kindle fire when i do n't have my computer handy , and i can do a quick check on places i may visit .
easier way for me to jump on and check out what is going on in between reading books . will love having the extra access
this game is ok. if i were you i would not get it . it is a boring game . do not get this app ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
this game is so addicting ! love how the games are timed . makes it challenging . could probably play day ! sooo much fun !
it 's awesome it is not a waste of time if you buy it it is challenging take my word for it
this game is alright . it 's a decent crossword app . i plan to keep it installed . i do n't play it that often .
wish i could give you a review , but it never downloaded to my kindle , not sure why , but i deleted from my account because it never loaded .
this game works well and is fun : ) what more can one say ! ! ! ! easy to follow and has different yahtzee games .
i use this good app to see good movies without paying any coin . i recomend you this app . remember is free and you can watch a lot of movies .
very fun game hope u enjoy as much as i do only bad thing is u ca n't up ur defense
hate this i this it is so bad that it dont even get get star . dont get it bad jokes
this app is really fun i love it so much it 's amazing it could use better graphics though it 's awsome
a fun way to pass the time while in between classes or at the doctor 's office or just anywhere , anytime . only been playing it for a few days and i think i 'm becoming addicted !
i been playing tiny monsters for 6 months i check in everyday to feed them and breed them . it 's a real time game so sometimes it kinda slow but i been hooked on it
this is a great app , now when you just ca n't remember that song that plays over and over in your head , now you can know the name and artist .
it 's never boring . i have it on my phone , and on my tablet . it 's good for my brain , i believe .
perfect app for my bank and lets me do whatever i want for the most part from home which is very nice when my bank is a 30 minute drive and i feel like being lazy .
find this game to be quite addictive and even fun . learning curve at first , as instructions are a little vague . good fun . works great without any issues on the kindle fire .
was fun , difficult to control though ! not something you 'd play more than a few times , but worth the download when it 's free . : )
the app does not connect on my kindle at all , it just sits and tries to connect . do not get .
game is awesome ! pay outs are huge and new games keep adding more money ! ! ! if you are needing a fun way to pass time this is a fine choice .
i like the game , so far . i like that there is a second challenge within the item search scenes . only on chapter 4 , so not too far into know if it 's short or long .
i really enjoyed this game . this is one of the best games of its kind . it makes you think , that 's for sure
not so hard that you ca n't do it , hard enough to keep yourself amused for a good length of time .
i like games that have levels of challenge . did n't really dislike anything about this game . i would recommend this game for teen and older .
tiles too small to work with on a kindle and trying to read what is on the tiles is just too hard .
they have cute stories as well as being great time management games . they 're on the easy side but fun to play
the pictures are very pretty and i like that there are 3 different ways to search for the objects , but once you go through it , it is the same next time .
if you enjoy browsing pinterest , you 'll love this app ! it 's a fun way to pass time when i 'm waiting at the doctor 's office or in line somewhere .
this app is cool but there 's not a lot to do using kindle fire if you press most apps it will open an ad . awesome but not all that awesome .
ok this game was pretty good , fairly easy . i liked the story real well and it played nice on my second gen kindle .
i just tried this game on my my phone and played it until the battery died so i found it for my kindle fire and downloaded i 'm hooked i love it .
grand kids thought it was just ok , was n't very excited over it but was an ok game to play . thanks
i played it once and it was a good game of its type . i do not play this type of flying game . it did play well .
if you like the xbox edition then you will love this game i would recommend this game to everyone so if you 're a guy that does n't like minecraft your not a guy .
it was a free seek and find game , and i like playing with it . helps pass the time while my daughters are in school .
great app ! it really is cute . we have n't seen anything this nice for awhile . and whoever made this is a very smart and creative person .
my 10 year old loves these games ! they are fairly easy , great follow up to first one . i would defiantly recommend it and so far no problems playing it on the kindle fire .
this game was okay , although the graphics are not very good . i found the game fairly simplistic and i solved the entire game in a very short time .
this is a terrible game . there is no point to it and i do n't think its worth the 99 cents . it should be free ! it is not entertaining at all and i regret buying it .
my little brother is addicted to this game . in updated versions you can unlock different types of clothing . i highly recommended that you buy this game
it is a good app for when you do n't feel like searching the internet for the latest world news and are lazy .
we have tried downloading this app twice it does not work , we have tom the cat and my daughter was looking forward to this app too .
i would recommend this game to everyone i love playing it it 's extremely addicting my whole family gets involved in the game !
i am pretty impressed with this app.it is by no means a substitute for microsoft office , however it gives you enough in the way of editing options to get a pretty great start on just about any project .
for all the people who have a kindle fire , this game will not work , maybe the first few times , but then , everytime you open it , it will close out of the game by itself
overall this is a very good application , but i would like it to have more of the features like the ios app .
it was helpful and educational and help explore my mind . it even helps learn new things and was fascinating . i love the game for these reasons . it really deserves 5 stars .
i love it , excellent game ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ; ) if you want to be entertains for hours tried this game . ; ) there many games out there but this is the best .
i would like to ride the horse and actually clean thing . overall its okay . i also would like for you to be allowed to name your 1st horse .
fun . addictive game constantly playing you get grabs by waiting 30 seconds instead of buying with real money . that 's great .
this is as good as on my computer , i love this game and have had no problem on my kindle fire . i play at least 3 times a week , works perfectly .
i 've had this app for quite a while and still have n't been able to beat the while thing . each level is different and challenging in its own way . definitely worth a try .
this is a perfect app for anyone who wants to text their friends and does n't have a phone . get it ! ! ! !
lots of fun and is a quick play . it is another good game to help learn and stay alert . many topic selections .
its just really bad , and its slow , and the graphics are terrible . and its just not fun . you cant even get that many birds , there are way more fun pet games than this .
i 've been using this app since i got my kindle fire , and have not had a single issue with it . very useful and customizable .
this keeps me entertained all the time if you 've ever played kick the buddy this is actually better ! as far as i played you are n't asked to pay with actual money its so entertaining and cool
great for me and the kids to pass the time at appointments and things ! would recommend this game id you like & # 34 ; island & # 34 ; games : )
i use this app all the time and i got my college age daughter to use it also . works great !
never heard of this first song and it wont let me past so i 'm unable to play this game . very frustrated , but it was free so ca n't complain to much .
have n't played long but fun so far . we 'll see how it goes once into higher levels . might review again then .
i did n't like the product so i uninstalled it . to me it was n't very user friendly and not much on instructions .
i got hooked on this game played the whole 60 something boards in one day . it 's all about mind playing . figuring things out
if you 're strong suit is n't doing calculations in your head while out to dinner or lunch , then this app may be perfect for you .
interesting so far . have not gotten very far yet . the first couple of tasks made me think this was to easy of a game , but that is certainly not the case .
a bit hard to get acorns though . but it is pretty fun maybe another mini game to play though would be fun
this was a bit boring . i deleted it and regret wasting my time .
fun game to help pass the time . worth the download , will recommend to all . have played it for a few hours now .
i 'm not interested in video games . my son showed me this one and i 'm hooked . it 's a great way to pass time when you have to wait in an airport or doctor ' office .
this is one of my favorite computer games and i was happy to find it in an app for my tablet . it is challenging as you have to watch where you move cards to benefit the end result .
it 's a good game for free . it 's good to pass the time when you have some free time to yourself .
if you are looking for a good app this is your app . i 'm a girl and i like . best game ever .
when i get bored this is the app i go too . i think that everyone should get it . i recommend it to everyone
better than circle word in books , addicting and entertaining ! all the grand kid love it also ... keeps them entertained for hours
perfect for free this is a good to waste time with . great time killer . way to go . what else can i say about it .
i love monkey 's and this game is so exciting just wish that i could play it longer before time runs out .
i could use a little more points but i love the multiple games , the different bonus features in each game .
i love this game so much ! ! ! ! its fun and challanging too ! i love how it has different speeds for you to .
very helpful to keep my calendar and life up to date . the reminders are great , too , if i choose to use them . also , very handy . thank you .
i love the set up of facebook for the kindle , it has a very large display of each post and it 's quickly response to each swipe and tap .
i wanted a calculator for my kindle fire and this was the perfect fit . try it , you 'll like it i 'm sure !
i got this for my grandson and he loves it . has been playing it now every chance that he gets
if you just need something to kill time and still stimulate your mind this is a very good one to do it . there are many levels and tons of games on each level . i recommend this game .
i ca n't work with 2 hands and ca n't keep him on the road . maybe someday i will get the feel of it .
i played it once and did n't care for it . i did n't like that you had to tap the colors twice to make them disappear . my opinion is , it was n't all that .
it is very fun to play . it moves along pretty good . it can be for adults or children . enjoy playing everyone .
yes , the review looks fake , but the app has been out for a while . just because this is the first time you have seen it does n't make it new .
this was an awesome game especially for an adult and avid mystery lover . i have a difficult time with my eyes so this was just what i needed . so hope to see more of these soon .
i downloaded this game onto my kindle for me to play . so far so good . my 7 year old grand daughter enjoys playing it also .
i love . to play games at night to try to relax . fun game . easy enough to not drive you insane but does keep you thinking

my sister and cousin love fashion designer : wedding dresses . i think it is an awesome game . but it should be free .
i just got it will not load not so happy so i hope a lot of you like it : p.s kinda love it
great ! ! ! ! the dinosaurs are very cute and funny looking . the buildings are unique and big . there is a lot of things in the game .
it 's really cool and makes all your drawings look professional . the only problem is it does n't have a normal brush . if it had a regular one i would give it five stars .
it 's great . i use it weekly . no more printing recipes from my computer ( wasting paper ) just have my kindle fire in front of me at the kitchen counter .
love this game . have played for years online , now on my kindle ! must pass every level to proceed to next .
it was very easy to find a selection in this bible . you can select book , then chapter from the menu . i 've been using this for a few months and it is great .
this another great game like dinner dash . i only played the free version , would have liked the full version but i like to save my money on books .
confusing controls at first but once i got the hang of it i loved it ! so addicting and extra entertaining : )
i love this game . there is so many beautiful things . so much to do . i can play this game for hours .
great game for brain activity and keep sharp . also addictive and maintain good level of interest . i can play this game for a long time without getting bored as every game is new and challenging .
... .but like it so far . the game play is good and the graphics are well done . not sure if it will continue to keep my interest , but we 'll see ... .
i have tried multiple times to install and load the game and so far it will not work on my kindle fire hd .
this game is hard to get started playing . i guess i just do n't understand why i can not just open and then play a simple game of cards
i like playing this on my kindle bb the best and this is second i love playing bingo good luck all
i loved the game and my dad had to stop me from playing the entire thing in a day ! though i do n't understand the trees , they look like they have paper leaves .

fun game where you grow monsters . it can be frustrating trying to get the monsters you want and if you do n't have patience you can end up spending to get the monsters . very addictive .

very scary and great graphics will put you on the edge of your seat ! i think it 's one of the best games on the kindle fire hd . totally try it .

not a bad game that was free , graphics are great and the sound is great also . need to grab your own and start playing now ... ... ... ... ... ... ...

great app . came recommended and works fantastic . i even get to review its work . give it a try . it 's a must-have .
it 's okay . i do like that you can get more backgrounds to choose from , i just wish you could delete the ones it comes with when you first open the app .
this app is really distracting for the baby , we use it alot since it makes fun noises and has alot of colors ! : )

i really like this game it is the best mini golf game i 've ever seen . i not to hard or too easy . this is a great game .
it kills time pretty well . the levels can be hard to pass but the attempts to get past the level can be more fun than actually winning the level .
not for me ! maybe if i played with somebody who knows the game already it would be different . i couldnt get off two blocks , so it didnt hold my interest .
will not load the games and only a few posts at a time . very big disappointment as i love fb and really wanted to play games on the go : ( please fix this app .
very good app also addicting though get this app works great on a my kindle fire get the app please

this is a fun game . not so hard that you lose interest . very addictive . i highly recommend this game to everyone .

not to thrilled of it at all . not sure why but if i were you i would give it a try
it is very challenging game , it did slow down as i went farther into the game , it started to pause and slow down .

really like the graphics ( much easier on my eyes than the more colorful versions ) , and the music is sort of fun . fun way to pass the time .

it 's angry birds . i 'm gon na love it no matter what . my nephews and niece like to use my kindle to play it too .
this game is okay . not too exciting . the first time you play it is fun but after a while , it becomes boring really quick .
it 's fine until you have your account set up then when you tap on something it will go back sometimes even back to the app store this app is junk !
for someone like me i love music and i went on pandora all the time but now it wont let me in the app . serious problem needs to be fixed
i 'm having such a fun time with this game ! i never used to win when i was a kid , but it 's satisfying to be able to kick the computers butt !
i love this game it gets challenging and kinda frustrating all in one . it kinda lags sometimes so that kinda sucks but otherwise great graphics .
i love this app . i liked the fact that it is free . i use this app for texting my friends and family , and it works very well .
now i always know where and when i need to be somewhere . very simple to use and i find it helpful
this is a great casino game . very enjoyable game they add a new slot game every day too . from what i understand there is in game purchasing but i have been winning since i started playing .
love this tetris game . rounds are short enough that you can play a round even when you are busy and do not have a lot of free time to play .
just downloaded this app for kindle fire hd opened it and had no problem watching shows it worked just fine for me
i have this game for my pc . i am glad they made it for kindle . i will spend many hours playing it . good graphics and challenging game play make one of the best .

i wish it was more educational . it is a fun little app thought , they enjoy playing it i guess . no problems with it .
this game is awesome . totally addictive , i would recommend this app , you can play without being connected . i was up late the first night i used the app .
it was exactly what i was expecting . it only has 2 play modes but that is good enough for me . i am constantly trying to best myself .
i like this game and have a hard time putting it down . this game is challenging but not too difficult . and it 's . free .
no instructions ... no story ... plain boring . even for free its not worth the time . better games out there . deleted first day
any time i get a chance to kill zombies i do this game is fun and addicting i recommend this game
this is an awesome game u need to get it it 's a awesome card game it 's amazing trust me i bet u will like this awesome game
i got this and app to play on the train . only on problem i must be on wireless to us it . this is an epic fail on my part not to research this better .
addicting is about all i can say about this game . once you start it 's hard no to stop good thing you only get 5 live to start . it 's the waiting that 's hard .
it 's a little piano , it 's handy , it plays a few songs , the sound is ok and it was free . life is good and so is this app !
u cant do anything and u have to wait . it doesnt show ur baby doing anything . the most u do is change the name .
is a good and funny app that children often enjoy . once they used it a lot is not that funny .
i really like this game . it is fun because u get to make a village and raise dinosaurs it is fun
player would n't load , and when it did had only a few videos . very disappointed . i removed it from my kindle right after installing .
it was a good simulator i really enjoyed it . it was the best one i have found so far thank you for this
get this app it is awesome real looking cars and awesome cars to totally great at money free get this
super cool game ! really makes you use your brain , so you ca n't really space it and play as much as i do when finding the birds , but i love it , really different .
hahaha i love this app ! i always wanted to play piano , now i can , well sort of . its also nice just to listen to the songs .
my daughter was n't interested in this one so i removed it from my kindle . i do n't think it was anything wrong with the app just not really her thing .
this game is so much fun . i ca n't stop playing it . the more levels i get to the more harder it gets .
it gives me a challenge because you have to have a number of points to get another game ! its fun
this is a pretty darn good game . especially to be free ! it can . be a bit frustrating to wait for energy to fill up but it 's fun otherwise .
numbers came in too fast , and then froze my kindle fire hdx ! ! ! ! decided to delete ... did not like this bingo game .
this app is fun to play with friends when you are bored . it is fun fun fun fun fun fun ! you should download this app ! ! ! ! ! ? ?
there were not any instructions for playing this game . where are the instructions and then i can play this game
i am really enjoying this game . i like the way you have it set up . keep up the good work with this game .
this game is so easy . you can pass the levels just like that . i thought it might be a little harder .
this game is good for those you like to figure out puzzles and search for items . looking may take some patience , but items are fairly easy to manipulate .
i have been searching for a fun game for a while and i love it ! ! i can not wait for more levels !
i did n't know you need internet with this app . i want bible i can use any where .
i can not get past the engine room so i 'm am getting free hint for this review ! i would recommend this app ! ! !
i agree there are a lot of ads and some of the games are difficult but all the same i think they are enjoyable .
like the hint and advice button , wish it was longer especially for $ 1.99 . was a good story , like that you are different characters , in the story .
too much trouble trying to get the shapes to form that you want to draw . boring and not much fun .
this app is awesome . its fun fast free and easy to navigate . it may be basic but its all you need to talk to your friends . the only bad thing is that you need internet .
useful . i use this at work and at home . friends who see this immediately download it for their phone as well
i wish it gave you a few hints sometimes other than that its a ok game .if you like puzzels you like it
i absolutely & lt ; 3 this game . i have had it for about a week or so and have played it many times and it has n't crashed yet .
a decent driving game with good physics and challenging gameplay . needs to be easier to get coins for upgrading and fixing your vehicles
do not get this app is horrible i do n't get how you get back up because i keep on pressing the screen but it wo n't go up
i play it everyday to see if i can get a higher score and my guy keeps trying to out score me
i found this game very entertaining with a variety of themes . in fact it is one of my favorite games .
simple and great to keep my parents ' busy when they are at a restaurant and waiting for food . has a & # 34 ; guess & # 34 ; feature .
i am smart and got a game that does n't ask for info . its awesome . i love it . get it ! ! ! ! awesome game ! ! ! ! ! : - )
fun game . but i always run out of tokens and have to quit playing . they should give you more free tokens .
great music for all likes . great to choose music that i like to listen too and ease of use it fabulous !
best word game on the market ! get it ! you wo n't be sorry trust me + it 's free so that adds to how awesome it is ! !
this game is fun . it is a little more challenging than others . some of the pictures are not easy to see . it is a game that makes you think .
i really liked this game because it is challenging but also allows you to think and act on clues and combinations ...
well just wanted to try it and see what it was but i really do not like it like i thought it was .
i looked at the pictures and i already know that it is stupid . who would even buy this app ? sooooo stupid
great game , amazing graphics , very addicting . very frustrating though because of constant time limits , endless attempts to get money out of you
it 's a great game i love it the game has a great graphics but the way your games currency sucks and the way every thing cost a fortune
its a lot of fun ... .. keeps me entertained . its a fast moving game so you do n't get board and my kids love it too .
i am really loving this game ! ! it is very entertaining . hours of fun ! ! i recommend every one try this game..
so . far so good . it is fun . good graphics . um cute pictures . um um my kids like . it . i do to
its cool . it gets a bit boring after a while . but you might as well download it , i mean its free . and if you do n't like it just delete it .
this one of my fav games for kindle . it can be a little slow but it is still awesome . : )
love it so much it should let you pick your own logo though it would make it easier . but i recommend this .
i downloaded by mistake , i was looking for photos slide show for kindle fire ... application seems ok but not for me .
this game is fun but it is pretty easy . though i say that it passes time and keeps me busy
i love all solitaire games and this one is not different . great game and i play ti often . do buy
not the best game i played , took me awhile to figure out how to keep it moving . i own and have played better games than this .
my daughter loves the princess memory game because of the pretty pictures . i like it because it helps her memory .
i like this because i can stay in touch with family and friends and catch up on the latest news and games
cool app 4 kindle fire . and it tells u a lot of stuff like your battery and how long of time you have ben on stuff
i love this game . i have it on all my devices . the only thing i do n't like is the limited game play .
i like that u have to gradually unlock each of the 101 in 1 + 20 it 's cool with me , if u like variety download it
i love the game , but i get sick and tired of facebook coming up all the time . if it were n't for that , i 'd give it 5 stars and this game would be perfect .
cant put it down so far . only on first level tho . moves quickly and keeps my interest could use more bonuses
it needs more demo time for like a hour but it is fun because i 'm still trying to build my manor .
i did n't like it because it was a bit too challenging to think of the words without more hints . just not in the mood for that .
storyline is not good graphics are horrible then at the last mission the data of the game was lost but they left me with my guns then took them
this is a fun game compared to the others . i have played a lot of these free games , i find this one better than most .
this game is very cool and challenging . i think people of all ages could play it . i really like it .
is it weird that i find this game kinda fun ? i sure hope not because it is a good way to pass some time .
my daughter loved this game ... so do i but she wont share . keep up the good work ! you should do kid models !
this app is ok but nothing to write home about . it is kind of fun but not that great of a review tool which is what i wanted
it tells you everything you want to know . you can leave settings for notifications too . i recommend this app yo everyone . it works on the kindle fire .
i liked playing this game but have it download on my phone so i just did n't want to have it on my kindle .
my niece love this app . wish to find more like this one . she does the makeup over and over again .
have not been able to figure out how to use this game ; need better directions so will probably delete it..
the description says it all . i am a big fan of audio books because i prefer that to listening to radio stations .
does n't seem to be as difficult as temple run 2 , but it is better than temple run 1 ... so there
this game challenges you to expand you knowledge and react faster . it helps you to learn new this and remember things you forgot you knew .
i love to draw so i like this app it is awesome and i like frozen if you like them two things you will love this app
just an ok alarm app . do n't really see anything special about it from other apps out there . i give it 4 stars because it does what it is supposed to do .
fun to try out all the different games . you win a lot so you do n't need to pay for money to play with .
i enjoy playing flo free it is so addictive , i play it every spare time i got . can not put it down
this is a really cool app , its a fun toy to play with , however i do n't like how the motion works on the kindle .
crash ! crash ! crash ! app is always freezing up and tried on 3 different devices still crashes then tried on different internet speed still crashes
i love this app ! it is so fun and addicting . my sister and i love it . it is one of our favorite games by far . i recommend this app to other girls .
i love it ! .i 'm not going to lie though it dose have some bugs but i 'm the only person who likes it or was but i recommend it so get it
i think this game should be free for kindle fire instead of it being 2 dollars because ive played it on my brothers phone and i loved but id rather be able to play it on my kindle fire
it is a okay game . i was hoping it would be more enjoyable . it does make you think . you have to know your logos .
i hate that i have to start all over again because downloaded on a new device , but i guess that is the price you have to pay
highly addictive and fun ! i could n't stop playing it , i beat the game in one night . i would recommend it for sure .
this the only social network game i play . nothing else comes close as far as i 'm concerned . buy the ad free one .
pretty popular with my 3 year old son ! he is in love with any and all angry birds ! love it
although i am currently stuck on a level , i still play and enjoy it . it 's not only addicting , but entertaining . great way to just chill out .
wow ! love this app ! love it so much . only comment is that wish there were more locations ... ... get it ! i love it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
i like this game . but it is a betting game . so if you do n't like betting games , i do n't recommend this game to you . the graphics are good .
i play all the time i have now gotten my sister addicted to playing the game i freaking love it
i love it it is so fun and so easy at the same time . i love it ok love it .
i play this all the time . i love all the different options given for number of points for a match , etc .

my lil sister loves this game and i enjoy playing it with her ! i just wish there were more things to do ...
awesome this game rules cool . this is not a waste of space yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
good game to play ... ... just needs more guns and better upgrades but over all i like this game i give this three stars
what do you expect . freezes some but ok. do not waste any money on it . a mindless waste of time
if your into poker this game is for you . i found it boring after awhile . not much more i can say about this except try it you may like it .
great game . i highly recommend it as a way to pass time and to give your brain a workout . have at it !
fun to play , challenging on the higher levels , but am from the old school and really prefer the word search books we work on all the time .
for the most part this is just what i expected from a mystery hidden object game . everything seems a bit small of a tablet . i would not be able to play this on a phone for sure .
excellent game with a lot of challenges ; i play every day trying to move up to additional challenges . excellent fun !
this is a very fun relaxing game in which i can make matches in any direction . the music and graphics are nice too . fun game for everyone .
i like the game it 's just you run out of money fast personally i would buy game i would like to see them make a 3rd to the game
i love this app ! this shows whenever i open my phone , and the numbers are actually big enough to read without glasses , an added bonus .
overall a great game ! the graphics are pretty good and its just a fun concept . i really like it . thumbs up !
i would rate it 2 stars but my friend likes it so i guess he counts to so i would not get this game
my 5 year old has loved this game since he was 2 years old . i 've played it as well , it 's worth downloading !
i really enjoyed tho . value of the coins and it was just a great gamei totally one hundred percent reccommend this game for anyone
i just started playing so i 'm not sure about it . i seems like it will be pretty cool if i could just figure out what to do .
i tried this game at school . i added a box to the house ! my life was bad so i wanted to see if it can get better !
i liked this game but the demo only goes so far and then you ca n't play any more . i do n't pay for games .
this is one of my favorite mindless games provides hrs of fun so simple yet so much fun . this is a must have
fun game . like that can change tiles . would recommend to any one who like this sort of game . fun . fun .
i liked the story , the graphics were decent , all in all a fun game . however i really wish were n't so many hidden object games and more puzzles that made you think .
this is an amazing puzzle game . and its free so you do n't have to pay for it . its very fun
this is an amazing game to pass time and stuff but it gets kinda hard to play cuz i 'm only 12 but other then that its an amazing game ! ! ! ! !
its a fun game but its way to expensive . i bought it and i guess its worth it but could be cheaper .
this is the kind of game i like to play . it was a good length . i felt like i was there and hated when the game ended . had a good story line .
this game is lots of fun . a good time waster , enough content to keep you coming back for more . highly recommend ! !
this is just plain fun . it is fun to play with my two year old when she wont let me read my ebooks .
this game is real cool me and my friends love this game it 's a lot of fun to play and it keeps me and my friends busy
i use this snow rain sun this is cool a a a a a a a a a a a
i love this app , though it would be nice if the updates came out at the same time as it does on apple products
love having this game on my kindle ! anyone who likes word games will like this . hope the puzzles change more frequently tho
does what it is supposed to do . a good solitaire game . i recommend it . great application for a free ap .
i 'm not on twitter as much but i do use it for accessing different people and connecting with upcoming events .
i put this on my kindle for my grandson . he just loves it . he is 4 years old and will sit and play this for hours .
never played hearts before this game . i really like the game of hearts . i highly recommend this game . graphics are great
i got this for my 3 year old , not worth it ! ! ! ! should be free the balls do n't work very well at all like they should at all very disappointed with this app !
this is a very cool app . this is very fun to play . i find it very hard to put down . i just do not like the in app purchasing .
you get what you do n't pay for . very limited options and not worth the download in my opinion . i was disappointed although i should have expected this .
this game is one of the first games i down loaded to my kindle fire . i play this game all the time .
hope others like this as much as me . i enjoy playing games throughout the day and this one works great !
no . i 'm . sorry this just is n't what i wanted . thank you but no thanks it is just not my cup of tea .
kids love this and so do i. very cute and creative app . gets used year round . not more to say .
really fun . i can sit and play for hours and hours and never get bored cuz they are all different !
bought the hints ... okay . got stuck and bought the answers so i could get past that point , but just more hints ! liked the graphics and it was fun up to that point .
my boys love this game but it rarely loads ! i have wifi at home and it still wo n't open half the time ! it would be wonderful if they fixed it .
this game surprised me . i thought it was going to be lame , but it 's actually quite fun and a good time waster . i would recommend it .
i really love this game but always out of coins and have to wait for 4 hrs . for more free ones .
great game . fun things to do and titanic is one of my favorite movies so i like playing a game that makes me think i 'm apart of it
it is a good app but it did something to my kindle fire and i had to delete it . otherwise it is a good app . you can trick people very easily .
i always like these mahjong games . they keep me busy and i never get tired of them . great game to get .
i love this logo quiz . i know so many of the logos but ca n't place them , and that keeps me going back for more . it keeps me thinking and is n't boring .
i 'm not one for playing games on my kindle or my phone but my daughter downloaded this game onto my kindle and i actually keep going back to play some more !
my 3 children love this game ! i like that it lets you try again and again and again to improve without making you start at the very beginning of the game .
this is an excellent product to teach small children or even adults who are starting out ! i would truly recommend this to all .
if you like mahjong get this app wish it was a little bigger but for free it 's okay . enjoy and can play for quite awhile with all the different levels
i love this game ... omg ! ! ! ! it is the best i have played so far . ca n't stop playing ! no more words come to mind . need to go play now .
fell in love with the first one and fell for this one too , cant say anything bad about this game awesome and free
sucks . not in english . sucks . not in english . sucks . not in english . too bad i could not give it less then one star .
this is additive but fun to play . if you like challenges , you will like this game . it provides hours of entertaining .
this game is so stupid . you just take care of some blue people with real money . and when you do n't play it says your smurfs miss you . # $ * !
this game is great i thought that it would be terrible but is wonderful and i cant get enough of it
i play scrabble a lot with my friends online . so since i am not able to get on the computer or laptop much , this will be a perfect way to keep my friends challenged .
good to get to your pins quick . easy to use and has all the buttons you need to make pins on boards .
i think it looks good just by looking at the cover really cool oh yeah but when i play it i will bet it will be even better
i am not a big fan of the app , it might be more useful if you have a tablet , but still not that great .
it 's not too hard and not so easy that it gets boring . it gives you tips along the way so you know how to play
well i guess it 's fine , but u have to get your own pics from the internet it takes a while to load sometimes , but it 's not so bad i guess
the title says it all . this is a game that is a pleasure to play and to look at . five stars all the way ! !
this game installed , ran , and played perfectly on my kindle fire . none of the previously mentioned problems at all . it 's fun and challenging .
this is an easy way to waste time . fairly easy to understand . good way to work your brain . i would share this with my children .
graphics and sounds are good . it 's a fun game if you like bowling . i play it from time to time .
very fun challenging at some points its easy at the beginning but does get harder you will love it have fun
my only say for this is & quot ; awesome & quot ; looking forward for the next room two . i enjoyed everything about this game ! = )
the game is pretty cool even good for kids but right now i 'm not sharing : ) i do n't want to put it down

i just started playing this game today and i love it . it 's not too hard but not too easy either . it makes you think and has no technical problems so far .
enjoy hours of fun and the graphics are really good . i do recommend this and it is worth the download .
everyone wants temple run now ... this app is a clever trick to get money lol it gave me a laugh . i didnt buy it though
love the cartoon but it is hit or miss trying to navigate or find what it is the player is supposed to get the character to do to move through the game .
i love the game . the only problem i have is see the levels of the tiles at night . i quickly realized i need my glasses changes .
overall great for using it just for the time but if you want to change the way the time image is , buy the add free version
i updated it and know it wont work its a awesome app if you do n't update it it will just freeze : (
all you do is try to get a stupid ball into a hole do n't try it it is really boring and stupid
bring on the updates already . i am getting tired of waiting ! i have all available stars , and i am getting bored .
my daughter is 10 and she likes the speed and challenge it gives her . easy to work will challenge any child with what needs to be given .
this app is very fun and so true it said i was on the nice list and i got a new phone for christmas .
this is a challenge for me since i find the subject matter interesting . i like animals so this is up my alley .
i find this to be a very fun and challenging game ! you need to plan your moves and be creative with your strategy . it is very addictive !
here again i like games that are quickly played when you have just a short time between appointments to play something .

found my printer right away . works as described . i 'm pleased that i can finally print from my kindle fire hd .
enjoy watching movies on hbo . good to have smaller device i use while on travel that way i do not miss any episodes of tv shows . no problems with picture quality or sound . good .

you will love this game ! graphics are good and game is just as addictive as mario on nintendo . good for all ages and the ads are not too aggravating .

i am just getting used to my kindle fire hd and have been adding different apps to it . great service .

if you 're looking for a fun free game this is the game for you . it is fun for all age 's . you should really get this game
i find this game very good . it is really fun . if you like match three games you will like this game .
really fun game ! you must try it ! build a pet shop and get other owners to help you expand and finish your goals to have the best pet shop around !
good time to spend with kids would like more games like this in the free apps section of the kindle
ive almost beat the game ! its so fun ! you have to lock the kindle for it to work . you should get it !
adobe reader has been out for a long time and you should download it so you can read things . it great ! ! ! and i think it keeps your kindle to run better .
like this very much . wish there were more adventures on this game but the graphics are good and it is enjoyable
this is a good game for people that love to bowl and the challenge of it . the pictures are very attractive too . i would recommend it for children as well as adults .
i 'm stuck on a level that you have to solve a problem to get out . so what do you do if you ca n't solve the problem ? stop playing the game which is what i did !
it was fun at first then it lost my interest i like games that are fun and interesting but this game was lacking fun and interest
this is pretty much the same as other games like this , interesting and sometimes really hard to figure them out .
this is a great game . it 's very challenging , like word to word . i 'm having a lot of fun playing word stack .
i can play this game forever ! i love trying to beat my old scores and the screen is nice and big !
this game was much better than expected . makes me wish that i played the first one when it was released . now i am very happy that i was around for this deal of the day .
i get to see every movie that is coming out before it appears on tv . what i do n't like is they keep sending movies i do n't care to watch .
this game is fun and really makes you think about picture associations . when you 're just needing to waste some time this is a good way to go
i dont get this , it is just simple to get draw something . i wish that this would just have draw something
not as easy as it first seems to be . addicting but fast play . puts your brain to work , and this is just in the first level !
i really love this game . if you like temple run then you 'll love this game : - ) this game is also great since it 's around halloween : )
this was a great app . when i 'm bored i can just play this to pass the time . i loved it .
i love the game and the customization you can do to the block and it really works out your reflexes .
i 'm just learning how to use my new tablet , and this application was not one i wanted , good luck to all and to all a good night .
so far entertained but frustrated . like figuring out puzzles but getting lost easily . would like easier way to get multiple hints .
awesome loads of fun ! it 's hard to put down . i enjoy it on my computer also . i 'm just a big kid at heart !
a very entertaining game . unlike whatever you may read , there are no permissions required when this app is installed . give it a try ! you 'll like it !
i just downloaded this app and it does not do anything when i try to open it . waste of money .
love it , very interesting , keeps your mind alert . love that you can play with your friends , and family members , it 's great .
as soon as i saw how big that download was i just deleted it ... .. and i thought that six guns took up a lot of space
this is one of the better shadow quiz games really fun and challenging and the fact that it is free is an even better
great fun . unlike other puzzles , you need to think . it 's a different kind of fun , you never tire of it .
it ` s fun and all but when i am about to beat level 2 it goes to my home menu and the letters are all over the game menu .
this is app has given me no trouble . it 's nothing fancy ; just does what it 's supposed to do . i like that i can have multiple alarms set
this is the game of a life time u just have to play it four your self to get the best feel of the game tell all your friends about it bet that it 's hard to put sons
this game is fun and is perfect for kindle fire . i encourage you to download it . it is also free .
very addicting game , very fun and challenging to one 's thought wave , everyone seems to love the game . my daughter and i keep each other in toe : - )
one of the funniest bingo games to play on kindle . easy to learn for the little grand kids too . would recommend to anyone .
easy to use and pleasant to the eye . tried other calculator apps but this looks better and figures are easy to read
who does n't love solitaire ? lots of fun and entertainment for those long waits at the doctor 's office , or if you just want a no brainer while relaxing .
this is such a neat game . the only thing i wish there was is more movement . the graphics and colors are great . and the fact that it 's free is fabulous .
i have finished all the puzzles and had a great time doing it . will probably get more before too long .
installed it , tried it , removed it . thank goodness it was free or i 'd have been upset . some android phone apps work with the galaxy but this one does n't .
got this for my 9 year old daughter , but my husband and i also play it often . lot 's of fun !
this is a fun game and it makes you think . i love playing this game when i 'm relaxing . me and my wife enjoy sitting together and helping each other figure them out .
it keeps logging me out and for all y'all who say it wo n't let u log on , u just have to update it : ) the app on my kindle keeps crashing and its extremely slow too .
the game is quite fun , although it could use a little more depth . excellent graphics for a cell phone game too .
i really like this app . it does exactly what it says it will and has variety of sounds for you to select from . include the various alarm settings , and it is a very useful app .
i downloaded the free version and wanted to see if i wanted pro , and what do you know i have the pro , very awesome alarm clock .
from the first time i heard this song , i knew i had to have it . it 's such a great song and has a great beat .
i am able to use this while at church and move easily from one book to another . now i do not have to carry my heavy bible .
at first i thought this game was dumb , but know i am addicted to it ... ... i have to get back to it ... .
i am enjoying playing this with friends and family . nice to have a big screen on my kindle to play this game . would like to see more words .
listen to it at home and at work . excellent variety of stations , keeps me entertained and also informed of what is happening with the news ...
it 's a good game . and it is fun but it is frustrating when you have seen the movie but ca n't remember the name !
easy to play and nice options ! its quick and the price of free is great ! the game is quick and has multiplayer options and makes for a fun time !
my son loves this app . it has fun and learning . anything with fire trucks always gets my sons attention and his friends attention as well . i highly recommend this for any parent !
definitely a great time killer ! i wish there was a way to get more coins though . a lot of fun .
i really like this game i would tell others to play it ! ! !
such a wonderful game so many strategies to use a must have game for any time or part of the day
this game is great . the graphics are an improvement from the last game and it is more realistic . i just wish that there would be more than 4 planes .
it is a great game . kept me interested with just enough thinking games , not so hard i did n't want to finish , not so easy that it was boring . i like this game .
this game is great if you love also its got a very good theme and is very fun you will love it .
i like the style of the game and the levels seem to be getting more challenging . great way to relax the stress away .
this game is fun but some of the outfits you can buy for the characters have like a whole bunch of lines going through them .
what 's not to love . its fun and addictive just like the real show . only on the kindle i actually win more ! !
the game is really fun and has a great number of cool weapons . easy to play but challanging when levels gain to a high number
i 've been playing bingo for about a couple of days now and it 's been kinda fun . but i have to say it does keep me coming back
the game is the best . i love to play this game with my friends ! the game is awesome like i said its epic !
love this game it makes you think hard not like any other fun game it is so so so so so so fun .
i use this timer more than any other that i 've downloaded . it is very simple and easy to use , very customizable . you ca n't go wrong with this one .
you do n't get to do anything at all ! ! ! ! ! all you do is bet who wins the match totally completely stupid
i loved it it is so wonderful and different i like how you can create anyone u want so u can make it your friends at school or ur family
this game is awesome because it is challenging and good for your vocabulary plus if you get stuck you can skip it or rate it and get 100 coins like i did
online rpg . fight with friends . only downside is you have to pay for the good equipment . still a great game though .
spider is great fun . i use to have it on my old computer . but my new one did n't have it . now i can take it any where i want . thanks
this is a great game . it has a lot of levels . and you can play with friends . it is super cheap too .
my grandson likes this game , i got it for him . he really enjoys playing this game because he says it is awesome .
my daughter downloaded this on her kindle and she said it 's cool to chat with her friends with this app .
never got it to do anything . i would not recommend to anybody . again maybe i do n't download the apps correctly
this game is very fun . i must say though , the giant monkey scared the crap out of me the first couple times ! the only thing i must complain about is that it seems harder to steer
i like this game because it is just like flappy bird and you can only get it with a ipad or iphone but what 's cool is that it 's like you have flappy bird just on your kindle .
this app works very well with the kindle fire , better than any other sky map i have tried . very easy to navigate and fun .
i do n't know what is wrong with everyone else 's devices but it works fine with me . maybe a force close out of the blue . but it rarely ever happens . i love the app
i have seen many websites o tv , and wanted to find out all about them , and this app does it all .
this is a nice game to pass the time , but i wish you could get to other levels faster . and you ca n't beat the price , free .
it sucks all it is is pictures and it does n't even tell u how to build it or what u need i think in my opinion it is garbage
this is a pretty cool game . there is nothing i have to say that is really bad but the only thing is it can be confusing sometimes
i did not like this game at all , no instructions , i would not download this one again . no thank you
tried it not to thrilled at all and the women 's keeps telling you to relax which makes you not very relaxed . it was free so either way .
this game is so much fun ! since i 've installed it i. have been playing it . lt is no only fun but it is a cute game .
this game is absolutely awesome , this is a game that i can say i 'm glad i bought , this game will go far . excellent graphics and smooth game play
this is a challenging hidden object ap . the graphics and pictures are just amazing . i do n't normally pay for games such as this but i am not disappointed in this case .
i had fun making these cards to my liking ! very cute designs ! i think i 'll be using this often . there are a few very cute designs and i 'd like to see more added soon .
i could n't tell you if this was a good game or not because it downloaded for two full days and then i could n't even play it !
this game is great thinking game . you have to use your head to figure out many puzzles . i think this game deserves 3 stars .
i really enjoy mahjong . this app is great as its easy to navigate . great colors and sounds . i can play my favorite game on the go !
nice app i can watch hbo on my kindle for free and i dont even have hbo at my house .
i do n't understand how this works ! i do n't know if it will cost money to make the server but , i just do n't know
it is like a demo , after a few scenes , it is finished . like a television program with a sequel . it is very short .
this game is by far one of my most favorite apps on kindle fire , but lately it 's been glitchy and wo n't let me play anymore .
i liked playing it what i could but my kindle did n't like it and i had problems getting past the second or third screen .
it is work paying for this app to have it without the advertisements . the kids and i are addicted to playing the game .
it is a great app it may not be as good as the computer version but is still very entertaining
this is an excellent bible app to have on my kindle fire . it is easy to navigate and is becoming my favorite way to read scripture - especially on the go . very good !
this app was unable to sign me into any of my accounts . i 'm very glad i had not paid for it .
i love it , very addictive app that keeps you thinking as it gets harder . and yes as others have said there 's more than 1 chapter .
this sucks most of them look fake it makes my screen freeze and messes it up i do n't recommend getting this
when i first got this game it did n't work but know it works perfectly . i love it so much that i play it every day now .
this is a good app . not the best but good . it does n't work but it is a nice idea . i like the noise and sound that comes with it ! ! !
i am completely in love with this game . it 's fun and it loads quickly . it 's so much fun and you need to get it ! now ! !
pandora is one of the most exciting music stations i have ever had the pleasure of using ! crystal clear music from the genre i love . highly recommend it to everyone that loves music !
highly recommended ! you will be addicted to this challenging game very quickly . a funny game that makes you pay attention to the small details . super funny to watch your friends try it .
fun and challenging and just the type of game that i love . keep them coming they are so fun . thanks !
if you want to try it first go to [ ... ] they have an online version you can play on your computer for free , but it 's not as full as this one .
great game keeps my grandchildren busy for a couple of hours after their homework is done . no homework , no angry birds !
other free jigsaw app i have only included 12 puzzles . this has so many more , and much more interesting pictures .
nothing special about this app . it is the same app that everyone who uses facebook has . i have it on my tablet , nook and kindle .
it is a very very very very very very very great game so get it or you will die today
just could n't get into this one . i got it because i thought it would be nice and creepy , but found it to be tedious and boring .
not as good as the heads up for iphone but still a pretty fun game . only issue is the variety of items in the same category .
kinda fun but not too hard ... i do like word games and this one did fit the bill . not quite challenging enough for me .
version of the classic game of solitaire , it is fun to play . i would recommend this to others to play .
terrible i love the show but this ai n't even the real thing and it is way to short do not download wast of time
awesome game ! ! love the story ! these kinds of games give you so much to do and you really have to think ! well done ! keep them coming ! !
i spend time every day on this game . it takes coordination and brain power . it can get frustrating but i just work against it until i move up a level . very challenging
so far it 's a good game . i hope i keep winning . i do n't have anything else to say . it was a free game .
it is fun to play but it did n't jump out at me to keep me going back to play again .
this is an awesome game that will leave you with hours of fun and challenging levels . plus they have great bonus levels
it 's just like flappy bird ! everyone should get it and play it right away ! ! ! it 's frustrating , but addictive . it 's pretty good though .
thought my grandson would like it , but it had pop ups asking to purchase options , too easy to spend money , i deleted it .
one of my favorite pass times . it is so much fun . i recommend everyone that enjoys the old fashion hand held games to try it is so much better on a bigger screen .
i love playing this game . i never played a game like this before and i am so into it i love it .
it wanted me to go to youtube for instructions ... i do n't want to do that ... it needs instructions at the beginning of it .
have this app on my iphone my favorite learned a lot from this app . easy to use and understand i recommend this to anyone open to learning something new .
not a bad time killer at all . not the best version i 've seen of the game , but definitely worth the download , especially for free
it does what it claims to do . have n't had any issues with it since i have installed on my kindle .
this game is great . the graphics are great game play is smooth and its really hard to put this down .
its not the best at first cuz most of the boring games are there before u buy any new games but once u start buying more games it gets better and fun
this product is great my grand daughter just did it a couple of times i will have to seat down to help her
this app is great you got ta get it first you get a decent hero upgrade the hp and your ready to go
the game is cool in all but u need more characters and rooms and more stuff to do on there
a great app - keeps everything in one place and allows for very easy editing of my life . a definite winner and a must have app
good way to waste a few minutes ... .but once you play for more than that , it becomes boring very quickly though .
this is a fun relaxing adventure game :3 if you like adventure games then this would be a perfect game for you
makes working these puzzles a pleasure since i am a nature person . i like to save them also to keep .
i liked the game but there are so many good ones out there . this is a little slow for me .
another app from amazon free and so much fun to play . trying to continue to beat my own score and love this app alot .
i really enjoy playing this game . parts of it are pretty hard but overall a fun game for me and the kids as well .
this game is awesome you should get it this game is so wonderful i love it you should get it ! ! ! ! ! ! !
love it , my kids play it every day . they think it 's so much fun . looking forward to more great games . thank you
the pictures do n't really show how cool this app is . there are a ton of effects , my favorite being that it can turn your picture into a sketch that looks hand drawn . its pretty awesome !
this is the best game on the kindle it 's not as good as the pc version but its still a great game
this is a wonderful app for all ages . ca n't wait for my grandkids to play it . works great on acer 500 tablet . thanks amazon .
a very nice puzzle game ! works well with a stylus and the pictures are wonderful ! i definitely recommend this game .
this is one of the best slot games available . lots of bonuses and free coins . i would recommend this game to slot lovers .
this game is very stupid . you get it thinking you are going to be able to pay games but each have costs money to play .
i have not been playing long but this is a good game . this is another game that costs real money . it is cute .
please fix this interface . this is not intuitive . i really hoped this was going to be something i played regularly .
i love this game so much . i hope that you will like this game as much as i do . it is such a fun game .
i was about to buy this but when i saw free i quickly got it . can 't wait to play : d
this is a fun game but it stops in the middle of your game so i give this app three stars for that
best driving game i have downloaded on my kindle i play this everyday i always play this game for entertainment
get go it 's a fun game build your car and let her fly many fun events to compete in is new some glitches but nothing to bad a freeze every once and a while
use this app a lot . it 's very helpful while traveling when on vacation . would highly recommend if you travel a lot . there is more information than just gas prices .
grandsons like this i do not understand it and am always getting messed up so i go it for the boys they like it
this is a fun game . it is very addicting . i love the story of titanic and i loved the movie as well . i like these kinds of strategy games , good for the brain
this app is entertaining at first , but it is a lot of the same things over and over again , it 's ok
i really like this slot game . i would rank it up there in my top five slot games . lots of fun .
i enjoy the slightly addictive challenge this game provides . for me , has a crossword puzzle feel with a little edge by knowing most or all the letters to the clues ' answers .
i went all the way through the first time i played . now i get to do it again with everything different .
i collect to a certain amount then i play , it 's slow going . if you have the cash to keep buying coins then it is the game for you
played the first level . very lame . after completing first level froze my phone ( droid x ) . had to remove the battery to restart .
the kids love this little game . it 's smooth , graphics are good , shame you only get one life before you have to start all the way over .
way better than the last one , worth the dollar . lots of features and i found no bugs . can not wait for another update !
so i got the game expecting trash boy was i wrong i would not say game of the year if you have played sticky ninja on the pc or mac ( i use pc ) then you 'll like this
this is a good game and i recommend you get it and see for yourself . you wont regret it . promise
i have always loved crossword puzzles and they are even better when doing them digital . i had enjoyed it very much and actually bought the full version . it does n't disappoint .
you must see good and plenty of fast thinking . it is lots of fun and i would recommend this game to everyone . so get on board with me and let us walk the farm together .
i would very much recommend this app . this is a very fun app . much like a nintendo ds game . hope you like it !
my granddaughter loves this because you can buy stuff and dress her up and you can even get her a pet
i love this game ! it gets more challenging as you go along but never really hard . great way to pass the time .
i love these type of apps and a free download how can you go wrong . if you like this type of app then go for it .
this skype was n't made for kindle so it did n't work as well as i liked so i think found their app made just for kindle and i 'm happier .
so i just downloaded it am i 'm already on level 11 and i 'm 8 and its already fun so wan na have a challenge you found it
the puzzles are challenging and enjoyable . the directions on how to move the story forward are not all that clear . hopefully it will become easier to understand as the game progresses .
usually love bingo but this takes forever to build up coins ... just wants you to buy them ! like others where you can trade , etc .
a children 's game which did not keep my grandson 's attention . i really do n't have an opinion . he did not go back to it after leaving the app .
love hidden object games but this was really not worth the cost . wouldnt recommend if you enjoy hidden word games .
this game is awesome and it is free . this is the best angry birds app yet . you should definitely get angry birds go .
ever since i downloaded this app , i ca n't stop playing it ! ! very fun , and addicting ! if you 're looking for something to pass the time , i 'd recommend this app !
i love watching movies and tv shows whenever i want . the movie selection is awesome and i can watch where ever i am .
this app used to rock . downloaded tons of music and even movies now you cant even watch them let alone download . do n't waste your storage
this game always freezes my kindle fire . the boyfriend always leaves unless your there like every minute . it would be a whole lot better if they would change that problem !
pandora is really really cool ... ... it has really good songs and it is really fun to listen to when ur bored
this game is fun . i like it a lot . the only thing wrong with it is you have to pay to get the dresses and other stuff . other than that i like it ! ! !
this is wonderful now on the go i can check the weather and its good for checking time this is great .
what a great program . eat your heart out , word ! works smoothly with other programs and has everything you could want .
need more restaurants in my area , but good app . even called and they were very helpful in figuring it out .
i love to play bingo so this is the game for me . the game is exciting and it keeps you moving .
have really enjoyed this game . it is easy and fun to play and keeps your interest going for a long time
found this game boring and did not hole my attention . would not pull this one out of the cloud to play it
great but goes back and forth alot . hints are confusing at times . what else can i say ? it was good .
if you have a young artist who is into the ponies then this is the app for you . very simple and easy to understand .
this game would be more fun if the payout was better and you could win more and it would also be nice if you could play bingo on your android !
i only purchased this because candy crush saga was not available . it is okay , but not as much fun as candy crush saga
while a fun game , some of the word associations are extremely odd which then require you to start the game over . some puzzles are fun .
pretty good time management game . it 's basic but challenging at the same time . for a free game it 's pretty good .
i enjoyed this game and the different pictures that made the game a bit more fun . i am still getting use to the kindle fire and it was a challenge to play this game on it..
i got this for my 6 yr old grandson while he was visiting . he really enjoyed it . i personally never played it .
good for keeping track of all ur money and all the things you have spent your money on . good app .
i think this is one app every user should purchase , it helps editing files on the go , but it is a bit laggy on my kindle .
this game is worth it , i just wish i knew more movies ... a lot of fun for those who think they have seen them all
it is fun at first but when you keep doing the same thing it gets annoying . i have n't played this game in a while though .
a very handy , ( and familiar ) easy to use app.i 'm glad i now have this on my kindle , thank you !
i recently could not use this app . without the internet . i have several places i play this where i have n't any internet . i will have to delete it .
this is relatively easy to play . some of the colors in the picture make it more difficult to complete when the background is a similar color . fun and addicting .
love it ! i love being able to stay in touch with my friends via e-mail and taking care of other issues through it as well thanks to this app l am able to do just that .
would n't download tried a couple times so i did n't get to try this one but i probably would n't have bought it anyway because of the price
the game is fun and all but the graphics are bad the good thing is that the items are cheap for a reasonable price
i 'm not really an angry birds fan , so i just downloaded for something different to play on days i 'm bored .
great game . played it on my kindle fire with no issues . the other games by this developer are great also . love to see great hidden object games . keep them coming !
it 's an ok game for what it is . not a permission crazy game like some . simple and easy to play and kills time . could use some better graphics and a little more challenge .
if you like designing than this is the game for you . the only downfall is if you do n't have enough stars you have to wait three to twelve hours for the item to download .
i am sorry this is the worst game to me so far all it wants is for you to spend money
this is a pretty fun game . i 've only played the free version , but so far , so good . a bit easy but i assume it gets harder as you go .
i will repeat what others have said and say that this is a great game for movie lover 's , not so much for others .
i use this app on my samsung galaxy s4 . seems to have all that i need to check my account .
this is addictive and not so easy as it does use logos from all over the world . fun and great for a freebie ! !
this is a fun game that is very easy to play . the replay factor is good . runs great on the kindle fire .
my daughter and i love to play these puzzles . it is still very enjoyable to us and we will definitely keep it for a long time .
i love my pinterest . the app has been fine , i use it frequently and have no issues with it . i am very satisfied .
i am really new at playing angry birds . it is fun and will download the others when i can master this .
this game is so fun ! the graphics are super cute and it did n't take me long to get used to the interface and controls .
i read the reveiws and got the app it is soooo good my little sis always asks me if she can play santa salon .
they want me to rate it before i even could get a chance to check it out . could n't figure out how to get rid of it so i 'm rating it without knowing
could n't get it to do anything , other than to try to get me to purchase something further . deleted it from my kindle .
this is the worst bingo game . you get bingo and they call bad bingo everytime . very cheap with keys and bonuses . i am deleting after this review !
love this game love the little people very cute easy to play look forward to turning it on very fun game thank you
my friend and i have the best of time when we play this .it is a good game and i want everyone to try it
it is a pretty fun game with great graphics ! love it on my samsung galaxy s ii . if i had a larger screen it might be easier to play , but it is a good app .
i rated this three stars just because it is not a game that i enjoyed . graphics etc are nice , levels are challenging it just did n't hold my attention .
this is really fun . very similar to words with friends but it has tasks to beat . ca n't put it down .
i enjoy this game . it is n't my favorite but it does work well and passes the time away ! worth the price .
just started this game , yet so far it is a fun and intriguing game , not the usual garbage that pass for apps or games . i look forward to seeing the rest of it .
what can i say ? diner dash games on any device is great ! i love it on the kindle fire . i would recommend this game to anyone for any age .
this gun app has great gun selection and smooth gun controls and graphics and great sound and picture and guns
i got this for my 7 year old granddaughter to enjoy when she comes to visit . she has fun designing the drinks and decorating the glasses .
this game is fun & amp ; works great on my kindle fire hd . easy to learn , understand & amp ; play . enjoy , have fun
daughter wanted this . downloaded it and no matter what she does it does not work correctly . i would not bother with it .
excellent app ! large , clear display of day and time , and the ability to set your alarm sound is an added benefit .
it is a very fun app ... but i was expecting for it to repeat my words as in the other talking friends ... . still worth it .
i have been waiting for a long time for this game . fun fun fun . i played this as a kid with my parents . now i play anytime . good graphics . thanks y'all
works well on my kindle fire and stops others from using apps i wish to keep private , like contact list , email , etc .
great game to pass time while waiting for appointments . i like that there are many different layouts to chose from .
this game is very fun . i would recommend this game to an adult and or child . it 's also very fun to play on tablets .
it is awesome . and i can get it for free . i recommend it for any age it is very challenging also . you will get addicted .
so far its fun and not too hard will see how it goes as get further along ... good time killer when nothing else to do
is fun and easy to play but it did an update and i had to start over from the beginning . lost everything .
its a good app but it kinda seems little kid like but idk its kinda fun but its hard too
this app is easy to use and maintain . this is much better than a paper list that you carry around and then lose ! !
had such hopes for this app but it 's not ready for prime time . hopefully they will be able to fix the bugs . it is so convenient to watch from my kindle .
this is not a & quot ; done in an hour & quot ; game . hard enough to keep you interested but with a little patience and thought easy enough solutions .
it really only has a few games unless you purchase the full game , no body wants to pay for games .
great game with a lot of hidden objects and puzzles . i felt like a detective ! humor in the storyline is a great plus !
like my title says it is a must have ! i love how this app . it connects you directly to the product so that you can purchase them . and updates everyday .
i have bejeweled 3 on my computer and loved it . this one is great on my kindle fire . i enjoy playing it very much
just wish they 'd come out with a new set of challenges more frequently than once a week . it 's fun to play with others !
i really love this app because it does n't freeze up and it 's really easy to use . it helps me through out the day .
my daughter ( who is 2 years old ) absolutely loves this game . it teaches her colors , letters , and animals all while doing puzzles ! wonderful app !
it is a lot of fun and it 's challenging too ... i highly recommended paying it is you like puzzles and stuff like that
i am not a big fan of any type of this game , but this one is sure cool . i would recommend this one to anybody . nice job .
i love this game ! ! ! ot really is like playing the real arcade game ! ! the puzzles are cool as well . if i had enough grabs i could play all day ! ! !
another good game to keep me occupied . i like the fact that there is a story and each step is part of a bigger objective .
so much fun . accidentally found it looking for other apps and downloaded it just because it was free . i 'm glad i did . it is very challenging but great when i get a new element .
the levels are not so hard that you ca n't figure them out . nor are they so easy that you get the level in a few seconds . more levels would have been much better .
i love the bible trivia game . lots of fun and educational for all . i would have paid for this game it is worth it .
i got the free app first to see if i would like it , i did . it 's a great game , grandkids love it also .
this game requires a lot of skills and it is very tricky , but ca n't seem to put this game down . really like this game . : )
it 's addictive . it gets really hard after a while . i have several types of games like this and this one is the best .
i 'm still learning how to work it , so that i can get the best music that i like . but i think it 's a great thing . i love the whole idea of it .
i play this game with my granddaughters . i play it when they are not around even more ! all of these story games are fun . i would recommend these to anyone .
this app is so much fun . you have objectives to try to complete . you get achievements to get . and there are daily bonuses ! this is a must have app .
i like this game . its fun and addicting . i have n't had any problems yet . so far this game is cool .
i wo n't give up my email & password , possible scam , for something i do n't want ! if i wanted to pay for an app i would just choose one that has a better record .
this game takes alot of concentration . keeps my mind going . it is great . everybody can play it . keep the levels coming
great app to get books organized . i have mine setup into multiple categories so i can find them easily . very helpful program and very intuitive ! ! !
i like this but i am too slow in my answers , yes would recamend this to friends . fun , makes you think
i thought that it did get boring after a little while but the game was great in the beginning i think its still a game that all ages can enjoy
i 've been waiting for this game to come out for my kindle fire . my sister talked about it so much for her ipad . i love it and it can be very addictive .
if i need to purchase items in the app it is not a free game . free means free ! please stop with paid games as the free app of the day . it 's old already .
this has been a good game . i have spent many hours of entertainment with the game . all the games i have been playing this is just as good if not better .
seriously ... the more you use this - the more you will like it . has to be used to appreciate it . i now put it on all of my devices .
i like it it 's fun it is a good game to play you should play it . you should buy it now .
this app is great ! i have found some really great deals here ! keep them coming ! i look just about every day for an awesome deal to steal !
what a great and simple concept for a game . i highly highly recommend this game for people of all ages . 5 stars .
installed on my fire and it is very fun . it 's not hard to earn the points to unlock the other games . i would recommend this game to others .
there 's no way to move past what you ca n't guess . you have to keep on searching until you find the answer , gets frustrating .
this game is fun because you do n't know what floor your gon na get in the end and it keeps your mind busy
it crashes a lot . it says it stopped working ; wait or force close . i wait but it never starts . you have to force it closed .
i enjoy this game and it reminds me of words that i can use in the game & # 34 ; words & # 34 ; . it is a learning tool for the brain .
this is a pretty decent game to play daily . the only bad thing i have to say about it is it takes way to long to get swords and you really ca n't get very far without them .
the app is very addictive . i play this game every time i get on my kindle fire . it 's a great game for being free ! !
good graphics and lots of action . a very enjoyable game on the kindle ! download it & amp ; give it a go .
this is a great app and has n't let me down . i enjoy many stations depending on what i want to listen to . i find this app very easy to you .
same review as the above games . you are frustrating customers with too many ads and risk the loss of kindle lovers
this app is very easy to use . i 'm happy with it . it will get a lot of use from me .
this is a great brain work out . difficult and challenging ... both of which are important for exercising your brain . i encourage anyone to try this game .
this came in handy during nemo . i downloaded it and it had live updates from all over the states that i watched . love it .
this app is really fun and cool to have . i like the different types of sand in the application . it 's just fun .
it starts out easy but then it gets harder . just enough to make you stop and think of another way
sweet app of the day , doors what it says . you can convert old photos that you have . ca n't complain other then it 's a little slow but still give it a five star rating
i had a hard time putting this down and taking care of the house . it is a fun game that makes you think but relaxing at the same time .
this reminds me of playing the real game at the fair . just realized you can sell the prizes for more tokens !
this is an awesome app ! ! it helps me when i have to get up in the middle of the night ! get this app and rate it 5 stars and a good opinion !
what more can i say ? it is sudoku , a good way to pass some time . only get it if it free .
i think its good but , once i deleted one world in minecraft it kept giving me this notes saying & quot ; can not open & quot ;
fun and relaxing game . i like how it does get challenging towards the end of the month . graphics are good and it is easy to play on my kindle .
great story line for hidden objects ! which makes many objects to search for under the time line . ca n't wait to see what 's in store for me to accomplish !
this game is super fun and cute but it freezes and does n't click at certain times but other than that really good
i love this game it is easy to play fun and you can meet new people you do n't have to wait long
i love this game so much i would recommend it to everyone i know . i 've always wanted to be a princess .
awesome it could n't be cooler . i love this so much it makes my pictures look so much cooler and better than they are now .
the eye hand coordination is awesome i have to really pay attention keeping up with everything i love it so much
i deleted this game after playing it only once . it kept freezing up and is hard to play on the kindle fire . i would not recommend it .
very helpful for me since i do n't keep track on when my next period is . this app just does it all for me and is extremely helpful . glad i got this .
this is a lot of fun to use and the horoscope is accurate on sometimes . worth the download because it is free .
my grandson like this he says it really helps your brain . it 's a little too hard for him but he tried . he likes the game .
i love this game , its original ( amazing in this day and age ) and just plain fun . i play it all the time ! !
i like this app , but i do n't really use it b/c i have one on my phone that works just as well .
thus us such a cute game that any kid can play . my youngest plays thus on her own without worry of ads . i think this game is really fun
clues are pricey and often not helpful . i love playing though . seek help on facebook if you have patience . often friends can help .
new to candy crush , but very similar to other games . learning to like it more each time i play . thanks !
i have been waiting for forever for this app and i 'm so happy its finally here ! its so easy to use and i suggest it for any fashion fanatic !
this game is fun but not exciting . its a hit or miss . give it a try you may like it .
grandson loves it . i do n't play it but it keeps him occupied for a while . not a game for me but good for him .
i was charged for this puzzle but it would not load would like game or a refund on my account not installed
i like this game just wish there was a way to pass if i ca n't get the answer . but it 's . fun .
it 's ok but i did n't use it as much as i thought i would . i 'm sure someone else would enjoy it better .
decent search game , with some other interesting puzzles , and enough goals to work towards to keep it engaging . but amazon 's word minimum is lame , for the record .
i like it but it gets boring . it makes me stop being on my device for a while . i hope you at least try it . it your choice not mine
very fun and a very short learning curve . picked it up today on amazon 's free app of the day ...
this game is so much fun , i ca n't stop playing it . if they keep coming up with more temple run games , i 'm going to download those too .
very addictive game i have had a hard time walking away . i love that it has so many levels . would highly recommended playing .
very cute game ! have not played it long , but am enjoying what i have seen , so far ! thumbs up ! thanks for the game !
block story lite ia an awesome game . best on my kindle yet . what would make it better is if you could save . i am planning to get the full version . i highly reccomend it .
graphics are awesome and the puzzles are challenging . i definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes puzzles and a great storyline .
for some people they might like this game but as for me i do n't like it at all . its just not my type of game .
challenges your thinking patterns . be ready to laugh at yourself . fun , fast paced and definitely addictive . great to play any time .
this was my favorite game until they updated it and now all i get is forced close . tried uninstalling and reinstalling and it still wo n't work on my kindle fire .
this is a very fun game ! ! i wish we could play without the coins . but i would recommend this game to anyone ! ! it 's fun to see your weekly ratings too !
it 's fun so far . i did n't quite understand the way the game is played but it 's simple and a fun way to kill time . no complaints as of yet .
i like it ... fun to play ... some thing different and i enjoyed it ! thanks ... good game .
fun and addicting although i wish it was more options in winning free tokens . but i still love the game any way
my granddaughter just love to play this gave , but we are having a problem with getting it to work right now . it says it need an update .
thought my husband would like this game as he likes to hunt and likes to play games on the kindlefire . he played it for 10 minutes and said it was stupid . deleted from the kindlefire .
fun game for all ages . great game for a time killer . easy for anyone to use . i did have something it did n't work right .
i thought a lot of the topics were super vague . it 's not a lot of fun when you do n't feel like you 've got a fighting chance .
love this game . between this one and seasons , i like rio the best . playing the other versions has made it easier to play rio .
kind of hard to catch on , but when you do it grows on you . got ta be fast to get ahead
no problems with it and i loved . it 's price wish some of the paid . for apps . worked as well as this does
my two year old niece loves to play this app on my kindle because it shows her how to play songs she knows ! i also enjoy it !
great ! works great ! i need some more words to fill up ! wow this is a lot of writing ! two more !
i love being able to see family friends , etc pictures . meeting new people while playing bingo , slots , read a book , search the internet . and so much more . fun
fun and you can guess an you can guess things and you can use hints which is really fun and cool .
i have more than one version of solitaire . they are all fun to play . my grandson enjoys this one on my tablet !
this angry birds release starts easy and gets more difficult as you go . good addition to the angry birds library .
lovely game . plays very nice and the different tile sets adds an extra element to enjoy . quest is nice and classic has multiple layouts .
really enjoyed the game until i figured out how limited it was . but guess what ? draw something is in the appstore now ! ! ! ! ! ! : d
seems to work great and you can see the exact percentage in front of you at all times . good app .
i find it difficult at times but enjoy it . some of the harder photos really make you rack your brain .
excellent game see my previous review of this game , you wo n't go wrong if this is your favorite genre of strategy gaming .
the calculator is a calculator after all . however , i expected more features and skins for the extra 99 & cent ; . the basic features and scientific features are offered in the free version .
this has been a long time favorite on my computer . the graphics are excellent . glad i can play it on the go .
who ever rated this game 1 star get a life . the only reason i did n't give it 5 stars is because you cant move forward
it is cool an fun but warning needs wi-fi to play other than that it works great an looks awesome on my kindle fire
well worth the $ 5 , but i wish it were longer . i would . definitely buy the number 2 version if they put it out .
this is like the only app that lets me hear all the music i want right from my head phones . its so amazing just enjoying your music .
i 'm so glad that i down loaded this game ! it really is a lot of fun to be playing ! love it .
fun and bright colors that even little kids can play with . it is easy to use - i would recommend .
finally i got this working on both of my kindle fire hd . i am having a little bit of a problem switching users inside the application but i am very happy that this app finally works on kindle !
this is a free game , and it helped to kill a couple of hours at work . what more can you ask for ?
it is not as good as it says it should be . gift for family member and they do not like this product . can not hear person on other end very well .
great hide and seek game for young children . she enjoys looking for all the animals and loves to play it .
it 's cool having a variety of music choices to suit whatever mood you are feeling . i 've used it quite a bit just to relax .
very well done , so interesting to play and give time away if it has some extra boring time . a a a a
this app is not very good for the kindle . what the kindle needs to go is just a volume control to the side of the kindle like the ipad .
really fun game and it gives you free coins every hour so there is no need to spend real money . the mini games are fun . i really like how the game themes change every game .
not really a lot to say except it works well and i like a good game of solitaire at times .
all you can do is try it , yes at first it is hard to get used to . however once you get it then the real fun starts .
this is so much better than the old one . more options for words , being able to save . wish they would have added a few more brush choices though !
a very good touch and click a bit short but a very enjoyable couple of hours but i 'm glad i did n't pay for it
the only bad thing is you have to pay for netflix but that regular do n't know why people are giving it less than 5 stars
definitely worth 99 cents . this game is a ton of silly fun . love the sound effects and graphics . too cute .
not too bad . it is pretty fun but than gets old fast . my five year old loves it . i still play it when i 'm bored .
fun , especially if you like variety ! unlocking more is enjoyable and they are just challenging enough without being too hard .
love the game and this one is fast and really fun . i play it on my new kindle fire and have a ball !
if your bored this is a good app . but it is not a challenging game . at least next time i am the fair i will win at this game
still trying to figure this one out but is a good logic type game to keep your mind going so i recommend it highly
am just finishing level one . know it is going to get more challenging . i like this app companies games . straight forward , easy to use .
after i figured how to use it with the icons and reminders it was great . its the only calender i use now .
not sure the deals are close to the human deal . hard to win it seems . but okay to pass time .
love how this app has lots of challenges and that 's its free . if i were you i get this app .
i saw it 's movie and reviews and it looked like an awesome game . then when i played it turned out to be a easy to play hard game that was really just ok
i have a lot of fun and challenges playing this game and i love the colors . it is a must have for everyone !
this is the best one i have found so far . there are some words that do n't match the category you are looking for but that makes it more challenging .
i like this app because you can download more puzzles than the basic ones . you can choose how many pieces you want the puzzle to be broken into . great app !
not that much fun ... there are a ton of poker and card game apps out there , and most are more fun than this one .
awesome game to kill time and a great strategy game all around . better than any village building game on kindle .
i tried to download the free app but its trying to charge me . i never buy an app without trying it first so i guess this will have to pass . bummer
i downloaded this app and played it a few times . i really have n't played it much since i downloaded it . gets boring after a while .
i love this game on my kindle and it is totally awesome i recommend this game to anyone who wants to take care of a family .
i have tried other gin rummy card games and they were terrible . this game is fun and challenging and has the best graphics around . you can also set the difficulty level .
my son did not like this , it was very frustrating to him that it would not set up correctly . if anyone has advice to help us figure it out that would be wonderful . thank you
i love city building games . this is one of the best . i play every day , a few times a day .
i love this app when i first saw this on my friends ipod i did n't get the point but when i got it , it was addicting and fun
really have fun playing this game . it keeps you entertained for quite a while . hours of fun . lots of coins to win
i like the convenience of wifi , and on demand especially if i miss a program its just a wonderful feature
cute fun filled game for all to enjoy would recommend buying it , my grandson and grandaughter are really enjoying it
i really like this game , but i find it very hard to play with just the free coins . i guess i 've just not been lucky enough to hit a big one to play longer yet .
i just knew this was going to be the free app of the day soon because the original quell had already been one . yay ! i love amazon !
i wish it would let me play more than one card just starting out . kind of slow right now . all in all a decent bingo game . how exciting can bingo get .
its a waste of space and time . it is literally a stupid test do n't waste your space on the stupid app . ( which is what this dumb thing should be called . )
i really , really enjoy playing spider . a friend said it 's more fun than playing regular solitaire and i totally agree .
this will help me a lot with the different classes i have at church . it will help if i become teacher eventually .
i thought i knew television pretty well , but i was stumped at the second level on a show . i could n't believe it . this game is not as easy as you think it will be .
what more can i say ? it works as advertised . i can check my balance anywhere i have a wifi connection .
just wish you could play against other human opponents for better competition . love to play in person as well . a fun family game .
this game is awesome there are some problems but there small like loading slowly the tutorial is really helpful and good
i like this type of puzzle . i like that you can also move tiles around to help solve the puzzle .
enjoy trying to figure these out is lots of fun for time spent . the different difficulty levels adds new challenge as well .
great fun game to play its a great game to play to kill time or take your mind off life
this is a really fun game . i love the challenge of each new level . i would highly recommend this game to everyone .
after playing for about 15 minutes , the game will not allow you to go to the next level until you pay . advertised as free , what a rip off .
this game is great . addicting ca n't stop playing you need to try it . you won ' t want to stop playing
i love this game . can not play it enough . hats all the ads ... .but love the game . great free download . get it

it 's like fruit ninja ! this game is great to play and i 'm loving the challenge it presents the player . all in all a must have app !

i love this app . it is amazing and i am going to recommend it to everyone . thank you app developers ! !
this game is awesome and just like the real tv show .i think that everyone should get this game . the best game ever
it is a good game that makes you feel like you are in the casino . would like to see more frequent payouts but all in all all good game .
so i get really sucked in to this great game then i got ta pay another $ 5 to keep playing ? seriously ? !
fast spins compared to many other games . good graphics . four hours for points a little long . just started but lots of fun .
excellent customer service and great product . will buy from again , great price . cant believe how fun this is for the kids . love the free apps ! ! !
i liked the game , some of the words are impossible to guess , but it 's old fashioned fun and a great game to keep you busy ...
just ok for me , a little slow but still fun . i still play it every now and then . it 's ok
this game is free on other devices but not kindle ! i hate when it is like that . i mean it should be fair we should get games free too !
got a little tedious after about a half an hour . guess i am not what could be called a gamer .
i like the idea of several short , easy to learn games ... would give it 5 stars if it did n't do so much selling .
i 've always wanted to learn to play piano and this app helps make that happen . i totally recommend , two thumbs up !
love this game you have many hours of fun puzzles are fun i ca n't wait to load the next game . keep up the great work
i really like this game . it keeps you constantly thinking . there are many games like this . out there however , i think this is the . best .
this is a great game for those who like to use their heads . some puzzles are harder than others but they are fun and i would recommend this game to others .
talk about using your brain . this game can drive you nuts and that is the fun of it . love these games that make you use your brains . recommend this to everyone .
not liking this game . i 'm going to uninstall the app . it 's boring for me . i would not recommend this game
someone help how do i know how many coins i have i have got 12 achievements unlocked and i can buy anything for 15 coins ! ! ! otherwise it an & quot ; ok & quot ; game
fun and fast , always moving , many ways to win . i 'll challenge you to play bingo run and see for yourself .
it was okay . it would be a lot better if it was n't for all the ads that keep popping up . very annoying .
not worth a dollar . not realistic , not entertaining , just took up space . even the boys were not interested . i kept it but it is never used .
very nice app with a unique approach . it has a good tutorial to help get you up to speed . fun and entertaining . looks very good on kindle fire .
granddaughter really loves this app , i would like to be able to increase the skill level but she is enjoying the app .
this is a fun temple run type game . it is a bit laggy on kindlefire and has a few issues however it is worth getting and its free
the mahjong genius is a fun game that i enjoyed playing . it is very easy to learn how to play .
i like this game so much i am not a big fan in puzzle games but i like this one you should get it
a fun and different slot game . give it a try for yourself and see what you think . has different levels that you play
i really love this game . the scenes are just so beautiful -- i love that . it is fun finding the hidden objects - some are pretty hard to find . very happy with this product .

my daughter has been learning french and i have been doing the spanish . we love it . highly recommended . very addicting .
this is a lot easier than trying to circle words with a pen or pencil -- -- and the words are not ordinary
i think this is a very fun game and that everybody should have it . the monsters are cute and also look cool .
this is one of those games to keep on your device in times you are bored and want to play something where no thinking is involved .
it gives me the current temperature and the forecast . i can also get a clear hourly forecast with just 1 touch .
this is alot of fun to play on the kindle fire : ) it 's a shooter game , but not one of the boring ones , it 's pretty fun !
awesome game very additive graphics are outstanding just wish it did not speed up as quickly as it dose but fun none the less and really like having other characters and the power ups are fun .

great game ... keeps you on you toes ... requires you to think outside the box . but this does not mean it is not fun ... fun filled hours : ) ) great app for kids
once it hit level 24 it got crazy hard . its a fun game for sure ... it makes me want to keep playing to beat my high score . get this game ... totally worth it .
this app is great . not only can i listen to radio stations across the country but i can also search for specific talk shows and it will give me a list of stations that are currently playing them .
never would play keeps saying newer version click here would never work very disappointed in this app ! lost many hours trying to install and uninstall multiple times to get it to work it is useless
i really like this bible it is so easy to read and study with and with it being on the kindle it is ready any time any place
overall it was a good game i thought it was a bit short . i loved it because i love hidden object games . i hope the next one is better .
super amusing game . skip the free app . just go for the paid version , if you do n't you will end up getting it anyways . very addicting .
so far i like the game . as long as i can keep playing without spending money i will . keep up the great work .
very fun and adicting . seriously , when u start ur eventually gon na die , then ur gon na wan na beat ur high score , and ur never gon na get off ! overall : great game .

hours of games , so many to choose from , i enjoy the double deck version , choose number of cards to draw
i love this game . i play it all the time on facebook and now i can play it on my kindle ! !
a great game to play to pass away the time . challenging but not too frustrating . definitely the type of game you would like to have to occupy the time . and it 's free !
it 's fun i would n't say it 's the best . most of the songs are relatively new , some i have not heard of .
i like that i can play my friends on facebook . cool graphics and sound , plus challenging levels . very fun matching game .
monster galaxy is so cool i ca n't stop playing i love it sooo much i wish they made more games like this one
love to play by myself and when help is needed the family ! good fun for all who play any ages and great pictures !
this is not a stable app . it really does n't make much sense to download it . good for little babies maybe ! !
its so stupid it does n't even work an add comes up so i press x and it brings me to my home screen
i did n't pick this one , my grand kids did . so i could only give a two star rating ! i do n't know anything about this game .
i could sit here and pass the time wit this game and it 's easy for my kids to play to
it does not help you spell at all . i see no purpose for this ap . nothing more to say . im done .
its a really fun game . i always make my pictures black and than the colors look amazing ! please try this app .
the kindle fire hd was a gift for my daughter who loves to read and draw . i got this app for her and she absolutely loves it and has created some amazing drawings with it !
hello just wanted to say this is a awesome game . this game is addictive . so if u like playing games on your computer , tablet or phone try this one .
like the different number to play and you can pick your own numbers to the bonus games are fun to
i would play this game all time it 's really fun i recommend it for sure good game ! passes time and is fun to play that is hard to find on a kindle trust me ! lol
easy to use and i do use it all the time . i enjoy being able to use it quickly when i have a hard time finding my other calculator .
great way to practice for church bingo . four cards keeps it going fast , start with two and then go up .
my sister watches disney a lot . they kept advertising this app . it is very addicting . you only get a few rounds to play . after that you can rest start the app or buy the full version
this does n't even work , it just tells you to delete all your stuff so the coins can get into your game . what a lie ...
words are easy to find but they do n't like to highlight easily . the touch is a little slow to respond .
best game ever i love this game ! it is so much fun lol i love love love love love it so much !
it was the first game i purchase to use on my new kindle . it was fun and easy to learn as there are several types of solitaire games to play .
it is ok and i enjoy it . i like being able to show my kids how to do it and therefore is a teaching tool .
a lot of fun for the few minutes you can fit in here and there . cute graphics . different tasks . not for younger children as tasks get complicated .
love playing the game but hate that it shuts down in the middle of a game on my kindle fire
besides having to download the extra data ive had a wonderful time playing this game . im pretty addicted to it right now so yeah . enjoy .
i love it it is so awesome and fun ! if i have nothing to do i get on my kindle and i play happy jump
the ease of the game and the challenges are great . wish it would n't use up so much power . only drawback is that you ca n't save the game your on at any given time .
this game is not too challenging but it is entertaining . hours of enjoyment for all levels . even the kids can play !
this game is so fun ! ! if your bored than just hit this app and you wont be bored any more ! ! !
i found this app to be much like candy crush . great for my 4 year old too . easy to play .
loved these puzzles . great way to work the mind in a different way . leave a comment and unlock new levels .
this game is very fun somewhat similar to angry birds but with guns instead of birds ! the only real down side is in the free version you do not get very many levels but it is very fun
why not get one app that does both work as a timer s well as a super alarm ? i like the variety of sounds as well as the ease of operation . five stars !
not really sure at this time.i have n't gotten the hang of it yet . may be i should ask my kids .
i love this game , especially because its about killing zombies , which i love to do . i just bought it and it 's a little complicated , but i 'm as actually getting the hang of it .
i like the game but the bird goes down to fast if you never played i recommend it so you can get the experience
my little girl likes this when it work . for some reason the kindle will go black and you can hear it playing but you ca n't watch it .
a great way to spend some relaxing time ... as well as , a way to keep the brain in shape ... this is one everyone should purchase to help relax and keep the brain in shape
this one is a keeper my three year old grand daughters love this app . easy to use and easy for them to navigate ! ! !
this game really takes out stress when you kill him and i really like the update with take a picture and make it a boss really cool get the game .
bought for my granddaughter , not too much time before extras needed to be bought to continue game . was n't that interested .
very fun and addictive . i think i like it more than angry birds . i cant wait for more to be released .
really was n't what i was looking for . i just wanted a thing to list books and movies but this was to much for the little things i wanted to use it for .
nice game the only problem i see so far is you ca n't skip the ones you get stuck on you are just stuck . do n't have facebook so ca n't ask them .
i really enjoyed this game ! it really makes you think ! this is one of my favorite games ! i love it !
i like the game ! hours of fun ! the payouts are great ! i recommend getting this one ! the graphics are awesome , feels the the real deal !
this piece of crap wont let me log in and i keep re trying to log in but it does n't work ! ?
love playing this game on my kindle ! its fast and easy and i will never go back to the card version again !
this is a fun game to play . i love the new updates that the game did . i like how you can level up .
i always wanted to learn how to play backgammon . i play it at least once a day . i love it .
i usually like to do word search when i do n't want to do a lot of thinking . it is something i do when i want to do some down time .
i dont like the fact that when you play there are still options for more words but it will say that you have used all your four letter word slots .
nice change from the first one . very nice . always earn the most . very very additive . i will be anxious to see the next one .
best game ever ! i play it all the time with my little baby brother : d yay ! super good get it !
fun and relaxing game . i love word games and this one is different from all others . if u like word games try this one .

if you like bingo you will like this game . it is very addicting . it is a big time killer and a time waster . it just like all the other social bingo games .
i like the free version so much i plan on getting the paid full version . i also have the french and chinese versions .
it 's okay . i could do just as well opening my phone book to a random page . but the price was free - again something about getting what you pay for .
if you like fruit ninja you 'll like this . it is very similar but has some additional challenges . graphics are good , works well and is fun to play .
game play is smooth and winning is fun and easy . bonus cash pops up just enough to keep you playing .
lots of fun challenging entertaining a plus one of the best scramble type game for kindle i have found . would recommend to all who enjoy word games .
i am a big fan of word games and this one delivers . a lot like text twist . bonus games are fun too .

its colorful and there are levels . i try to get the best on each so i replay until i do . three match with different obstacles . get it !
fun and addictive mind work has always been a great time passer for me . i really like this app . it has alot of levels and gives you good mind concentration .
i got this for my 4 year old granddaughter & she really enjoys it ! i try to get games that keep her interested as well as teach her something and this app seems to do both !
i love it . it keeps me thinking ! gets my mind every once in awhile . i really enjoy it ! it can be tough .
it 's enjoyable , but the directions for a beginner are very vague . i 'm glad it 's free . i do n't spend any money on it . i 'm willing to wait for more lives .
i realy like this app i want to be a pop star when i grow up i love the app
i personally love this game .if u are a person who likes virtual people games this would be a great game for u .but i love it
this is a pretty fun game . really simple for quite a few levels but it eventually picks up . it was free so i ca n't complain .
i guess i am to easily bored with some of these games . they just do n't live up to my expectations for enjoyment . i did n't move to more challenging levels .
i really enjoy playing this game . it keeps my mind fresh , and also i find out how much i do n't know .
this app is a great way to communicate with family and friends when you do n't have a phone and its free . i would recommend this app .
this game is a lot of fun . it helps me cook food and serve it . i like it a lot .
this is an awesome app . i did n't even know how to draw like that until i got the app . i think u should get it .
this is all my daughters play and my son even me and my husband play it we all have seen the movies
i did n't really like this game . tried playing spider solitaire , but it did n't have any options so i deleted it . glad it was free .
you should get this app it is really fun plus its free sure there is ads but it is still fun !
i really like this ! it helps out so much to see my account whenever i want to . it does exactly what i want it to do and it 's worth it .
i love hidden objects games . this game is great . i downloaded on my kindle . it 's free and very entertaining . game not quite long enough for me .
i truly love any game that has to do with penguins . it is fun fun fun and i would recommend it to others
as long as you are looking for a kids game it would be fine . if you are looking for fun beyond age 3 i would pick a different game .
this is a game i played long ago . it continues to be exciting , challenging and interesting . it is a short game to play when i only have a few minutes .
it 's an okay game . sure some of the levels are harder but they should defiantly have more levels than they do cause i got past them all in under a half an hour .
this game is fun . and kid friendly . if you have facebook you can upload your children 's photos for family and friends to enjoy . love it .
i like this app very much . i can check my local weather without going to my computer or the tv .
i really do n't like it . hard to understand & to me it 's boring . i guess it 's up to each individual .
this app is awesome but i wish the one with world war 2 weapons was free . as i said before the app is awesome ! !
best weather app ever . right way more often than not . i check it out all of the time.. most reliable .
my 10 year old loves this game . she has several games on her kindle fire . this one is here favorite .
i really did n't like it because it only showed facts and not cheats about club penguin so i did n't really like it .
i enjoy playing this game a lot . the only draw back is having to purchase extra bubbles all the time .
waste of money . bought game last night , & amp ; beat it this morning . it is fun to play though . just stick with the free version .
i like the puzzles , but they get a little repetitive . it 's fun . i would recommend this app for people looking to use up some free time .
why does this need so many permissions ? it is just a game . well i downloaded it because it was the free app of the day then became scared away due to the permissions needed .
purchasing was easy . addicting game ! saves your levels when you die . allows for use with current figures or simply play . great time killer .
let you watch the show you like on family for free - do n't watch too much - just when trying to kill time
i hope they keep making these 4 pics and logo puzzles cause i take them every where i go . if i get stuck my whole family helps
a challenge for sure . love puzzle games . different backgrounds and love the options available for the object or word . my grandchildren love to look for the picture .
im a huge fan of any music trivia or name this tune type game . song pop is one of the easiest apps i 've tried so far . i 'm hooked !
did n't get to play . live where cell phone signal is usually very weak . too bad too cuz it looked interesting .
been playing a bit and enjoy it okay . i will continue to play and hopefully enjoy the game the same .
i really like the game ! ! the only thing is there is no music ! ! its hard for me to play apps without music !
grandkids like this , but it 's ok for an adult . too easy in my opinion . they play it , i do n't care for it .
this game absolutely gives me a headache , but my daughter ca n't get enough of it . you can do more things with this version vs. the free one
this app works wonderful on my kindle fire ! ! ! ! ! i hope that you enjoy it as much as i do . it is the same one that i 've enjoyed for years .
color and decorate the nails is fun and entertaining for the kids . a good way to learn and be able to practice for the real nail art .
candy crush saga is my favorite game ! i play it every day and so do most of my friends . it is very very addictive .
after about an hour of use the scenes were repeated ! ! will there be more scenes added ! ! ? ? pretty boring after you go through all of the scenes ! ! !
it may be me , but , i could not get it to work on my kindle . if any one has suggestion please comment . thanks

i ' v played this game and instantly loved it i recomend it to people who love dragons and hunting who does n't
i really love this app - so many mahjong puzzles are too small to really see the tiles , but this app is great
i have been playing for months and i absolutely love this game . for a free game , you ca n't beat it .
it was n't what i was looking for . yes it is free , but you have to buy the full version to get things done .
one of the better games like it alot fun to play challenging like the graphics in the game as well
it 's fun and creative i like it soo far it 's not easy but it 's not very hard so i would recommend

love this game . the graphics and sound effects are fun . lots of challenge levels that holds my interest . i like it more than some of the other similar games .
this game is highly addictive and entertaining and good for all ages . my only complaints is that there are so many options and versions within the game that i do n't know what any of them are !
great entertainment ... my husband loves it , he comes home from work and plays he says it relaxes him . great for the whole family .
i recommend this game to anyone who loves sea animals ( or eating them ) i would love it if they added multiplayer .

waited forever and it 's finally . love this game sooo much and it is really addictive ! suggest this game to anybody who is a somebody ! get it because it is amazing .
first i get the news on a timely basis and then the application works like it is supposed to be . never crashes and it is very intuitive to operate .
this game looks totally ridiculous ! i mean why the heck would you make an app like this ? it looks super stupid ! it could possibly be a time waster but still !
good jokes ... but there is a limit to the # of jokes you see a day . unless of course you want to buy it .
great for keeping you busy - good eye exercise . its fast and quick ! just great for a time filler . thanks
i want to give it 10 stars because i love this game and finished all the levels . please make more games like this .

this app is amazing ! you seriously need to get it . you can buy most of the stuff and those through the items . and the mystery boxes are epic ! seriously though get it .

it 's so much fun . and can play against friends . easy but not too easy ! and love that there is more than one subject

i have played similar games but a freebie is fine with me . as addicted to bingo as i am i am always looking for new game .
this app is very stupid even a real dj wo n't understand it not even your own parents wat a rip off
i only played it a couple times . i found it to be too boring so i deleted it from my kindle .
it is great for your mind and keeps you thinking . it is also great for older people to keep their mind sharp !
i love this game it 's epic ! if you like word games than you 'll love this ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i recommend it to my mom and she loved it too .
this game is so annoying . every time you play it ads pop up . it 's a dumb game do n't waste your time downloading it .

i love this app ! i know it 's only an app but after taking care of them for a day or two you 'll really start to love your little monsters .
ran out of points too fast and ca n't play . will try it again later but it was fun while it lasted .
i highly recommend this game to play it is very fun and time consuming i be playing this everyday when i 'm bored at school or at home
always keeps me playing for hours . i really like all the games , they are very fun and addictive . i would reccomend this to all ages .
do n't waste your time find a better app . junk ! would give less then 1 star if they would let me . just stay away from this one .
i have been playing this for a while on my evo . so glad amazon got this so i can play on my kindle fire . one of the best grid puzzles apps i have played .
this game is pretty fun , and the game is addictive . on the other hand , it froze my kindle . whatever you do , dont get this app !
if you are looking for a good game this is your game it is a good game to make time pass by quickly get this game
did n't like it , did n't feel like instructions were clear enough , so i do n't play it disappointed as usual in some of the games i purchase
if you like slots that are competitive with others this is your game . however it was hard for me to get enough coins to play one game after another .
when you need a quick pick me up , this game is a lot of laughs . trying to get the stuff to hit the guy takes some stress away !
this app is very fun to play . also it is very much like the logo games . i think this is fun when you sit down and have nothing to do . very very fun game !
this is a great game that i really love playing . my 6 year old loves it as well . i think it 's a great purchase !
it 's got good graphics and i love that you can use your own images for the cards and the background .
i was first introduced to the game by my cousin . i hated it back then because i was no good at it . now that i can play it , i love it .
fun game and very challenging . not as easy as it looks . like the fact that you can go at your own pace . . . no timers .
this is a fun game , but it can get a little boring sometimes . but , you might think different . so you an go ahead and get this app , but do n't expect much .
this game really works your brain by making you think ! decent game , but glad i did n't pay for it . i have n't had to use too many cheats , good thing because they are expensive !
i am stumped . the game does n't go any further if you do n't know the answer .
would be a really fun game but it has way too many annoying adds and you have to buy a full version .
this game is so fun and all kids should like it because you pick your way and decide how you like it
i think it 's really cool and it is a lot of fun , especially for kids . i love all of the color and that each picture you make is unique .
i like doing puzzles and this helps me pass the time . a great variety of puzzles and you can choose how many pieces you want .
this is the best app ever . everyone should love it what a great game it is the best . best ever
love this game . very additive . ca n't stop playing . would recommend . great graphics and sound . interesting story line . you 've got to try it .
i had been a fan of mahjong for many years , i just got my game today and i am having a great time playing this game ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
the graphics are well done and it 's fun to play . no issues with the app on my kindle fire . i do wish the instructions were better written , but easy enough to figure out .
great game with a lot of opportunities . you could run through different areas and have fun ! i think that the game should offer more coins .
it is so cool i almost play it non stop . if you 're looking for a game this is it ! never regret getting it !
for a free game , it 's okay . it 's something different than the regular mahjong i have on my computer . but wo n't complain as it was free .
this game is really fun i play all the time it 's really fun to play if u r bored n it is great to keep it kids busy
i love this app because it helps me focus on the one who is always present yet so easy to miss . i recommend it to every one .
i play this game a lot on my pc so i am very happy to find this app . it 's just as good - if not even a little better than the game .
not exactly easy to figure out in the beginning but much better when u have it all set up . decent buy .
this app is so cute , especially for cat lovers . i was surprised by all the different things that can happen to tom , not to mention the sounds that he makes . too funny !
this is a fun and easy app i like the way you get 4 chances at guessing . it makes it easier to choose .
you can get it if you want , but its not fun . you can do pretty much two things and nothing else . the pictures seem nice but the game is boring .
i do n't know how to play the piano , except for one little verse of one little song but this piano is a fun toy
love , love this app . it is much more enjoyable playing this game while waiting in an doctor 's office etc . also keeps the brain working .
this game is the best game yet ! i love it . my little brother keeps begging me to let him play it .
i did n't really use this product so i ca n't say whether or not it 's that great . for what it 's worth , it 's just like yahoo messenger for your pc ...
it is ok but some times this game does get really boring some times but it is some times better then cutting up real fruit
again being locked out of the game in only a short period was not fair . game was a little crazy
solitaire has always been a favorite of mine . this is easily understood and relaxing to play . anyone can play it .
since there was nothing i could do to make this work , i removed it . neither pictures nor pieces ever appeared on screen . ? !
it is a awesome game but it keeps shutting off but i really do love it i think u should get it
a nice break without having to get too complicated . quests are usually easily completed even if you are n't connected to & quot ; friends & quot ; .
this is a really good game to play . would like to play more games like this one . play it you might like it .
i love this game and it works great on my kindle fire hd . i used to play on my iphone , but i love the bigger screen and it 's easier to draw .
a little hard to switch back and forth from across to down and hard to view in terms of size on a kindle fire ... .but still lots of fun and a good challenge !
it seems that i can not comment on your app.i have to be over 13 years to comment on your app .
this game is very fun and awesome for all ages . the only problem is the game glitches a lot . other then that , get this game ! ! !
connect kindle candy crush saga to facebook and you can play this game to keep up with your pc version .
i thought this would be a cute game for my grandson to play at holiday time , and even he said it was slow .
this game is fun . its a good game to waist time with . i recommend it for you . get this game right now ! ! !
i can download the game but after the game will not load . the game looks like fun but its a waste of time .
i am enjoying this but have to admit that some of them give me a little trouble but i will get them all solved before the year is up .
i love the idea of the bill reminder but it does not have what i needed and it took forever for me to figure out the app . i just got another one that is better suited to me .
what a great game , i love playing this ! ! ! ! ! i wish more games like this could be included for free play ! ! ! ! !
is incredible . i do n't know if it is my internet connection , but it gets kind of glitchy . but it is awesome regardless .
this is one of the first games i downloaded , and it is still my favorite . it is so simple and very addicting . a must have !
this game is not worth the time to download or the waste of your good storage space for this game
it did not work for me at all and made me mad . i thought i would be able to watch these movies . i guess not
i have been playing backgammon for 30 years , and i love playing it . beware though it can be very addicting .
in the beginning i really liked this add , but after installing and running virus software it hit on this app . so to be on the safe side removed it .
like i said before the bible is awesome and should be advertised more it is super awesome and a great way to spend the day on it
since the last update the app goes to full screen ads and therefore i ca n't do anything with it . i liked this app but now i hate it !
it helps my memory i just love a challenge . as i age sometimes i tend to forget a little . it is a great game
this is a great game to play i always go back to it i have some trouble with logging in to facebook and getting the deals to show up but i still love it
i think that it froze everytime i moved something and it is a waste of time and it has to many ads
but crashes optimus s. sent email to devs . so disappointed my family is missing this one . one of the best christmas movies ever !
this app simply makes it easier to delete other apps . there is no need to read instructions . it is intuitive . it 's not necessary , but i like it .
waiting rooms are not so bad anymore -- - ! my kids & amp ; i play this while waiting for anything ! ( we love our kindles ! )
because of the good reviews , i wanted to like this game . it never did quite download on my kindle fire . tablet froze .
enjoyed this game . it was not the usual hog . no problems playing on my kindle fire . big fish again turned out a fun game .
i do n't use this app very much because it is not as good as i would like it to be .
it 's facebook on the kindle . the format is a bit different than when you access it on the web , but it is facebook .
i like to play bingo and it is fun . it 's nice you can choose how many cards you want to play .
excellent , excellent , game and i might add a great app for the kindle fire hd . there 's no way to explain why i liked this game . keep up the good work .
i looked at the photos and all the movie pictures are easy ! this game is fun , so that means ... ... download it !
maybe if i would have given this game a chance . maybe i am sick of these type of games . i played it for 15 minutes and deleted it .
i love this game and for me it 's glitch free ! ! ! and it 's appropriate for girls 10 and up . and it 's free so try it out .
very fun . challenging levels . app works well , no lagging . graphics are good . fun upgrades to see hotel come to life .
i read the headlines every day to keep up with what is going on in the world . it is a quick way , and i do n't have to wait on the information .
i like this sudoku app . the color makes it interesting , and i like the way you can enter notes in the blocks .
i like this app because it has all the pinball from when i was a kid . it works fine and i love it .
this game is very interesting with good puzzles to solve . the pictures are beautiful . really glad i got this app . hope there are more like it .
it is a fun game . a little diffrent than other matching games . great way to burn some time . i 'll keep playing
was able to doctor up photos and post them via fb . and more all from my kindle . its worth the five bucks .
this game is addictive and very hard . i can not even get past 3. this game should be a little bit more easier .
my daughter downloaded this game for free and is very happy with it she plays it all the time , yeah
fun at first but after a while it gets old , some icons are repeated and some are just impossible until looked up
this game started out fun and as we sit in the level of 30 some it 's still entertaining for the family to play . would recommend this one if you like match it type games .
great way to spend spare time . i play it several times a day . my 4 yo even likes trying to play it . great for older people and kids also .
it is so much fun and when i am bored i play it forever ! it is pretty epic . i recommend this app to anyone who has nothing better to do ! : )
this game is like farmville , it 's okay , but it makes u buy things with real cash . i 'm actually just making this review so i can get free crystals .
really cool game the cars are great the tracks are are nice to and the way you custom your cars is really nice i really like it
this game is the best ever . i was waiting for soooooooo long for it to come out on kindle fire and it finally did and i 'm so happy
most have been easy but when you get stuck you really get stuck ! i like the challenge but wish the clues were easier to access . all in all worth it though .
freezes up then when lets you play it only is couple of times then wo n't let you play until full game is upgraded so im not going to keep it not worth money
every so often i still get those annoying ads across the top of the page . what is the point of paying .
i love this app ... it works great and one thing i love about it ... is that when u set an alarm it tells u how long u have till it goes off !
this game so far is very different than the other escape games i 've played ! i 'm excited to see what happens next ! i definitely recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a challenge and escape games .
my kids love it ! they are 7 yrs old & 4 1/2 yrs old . it seems to be very popular & has good reviews .
was worth the price . loads of fun . had a good time playing this game . we could n't put it down ! ! ! ca n't wait for the sequel
i think i 've play this maybe twice . for some reason i just ca n't get into it but maybe sometime i will .
it downloads quickly and it is just as easy to access my email on my tablet as it is on my laptop .
this is good to have on the kindle it is very easy to read and easy to look up what ever it is that you need to read .
this is great . having this app to watch shows on the go , gives you chance to be out and still catch a show .
it isnt really the most fun game but it was alright ! maybe you could make a little more hints so its easier or show more popular brands .
much better than the one that comes built in . i love the widget options . very handy addition , and worth the money .
i guess extreme means going off 15 minutes late if at all ... also most of the time i have to take the battery out to turn it off - uninstalling
this is a great game for sure . the only bad thing is the adds . other than that its really nice
my daughter loves the game . its very entertaining because it fits to the age of the child . i would recommend it to anyone .
this game is fun . have been playing for 1 day . i only wish you did n't have to wait so long for energy .
great app , i can look up any category i want and get the most recent stories on a moments notice . i like it a lot .
i just started playing but am enjoying this game . you match words & amp ; colors . sounds easy but it can get challenging ! definately a workout for both sides of the brain !
this game is a little tricky but it makes you feel like you were on the titanic when it hit its death .
im always looking for fashion type games and this one is the best ! i like the variety of things you can do and the shopping !
this is a must have audio or not . many of my friends who gets a kindle fire for the 1st time , i recommend this book . the price is worth it .
i use it for everything . it makes things easy to store and easy to organize and easy to find a month later .
i really like the game . i find it easy enough to just do this for a little bit and it does n't take up too much of my time .
i love this game . it 's so much fun . it is something do do that is easy and fun . got ta get it .
i think it is a fun game i like how it shows you all the homes you broke . i do not have any ads yet and hope not to get any
i have spent a great deal of time with his game . i have been enjoying it and not getting much done . it is a great game .
i really like this app . my grandson loves it . i hope you add more music and more variety to make the app more enjoyable .
i have n't played in it such a long time , but i do recall being entertained for about a month . i recommend it .
great for my five year old daughter but is only one story to color so when it was done we had to get rid of she does n't want to color the same things over
game was great on my 8.9 kindle fire , except for the fact it quit working occasionally . i would restart it from the start page with no problem .
i have this app on my kindle fire and it works great ! i havent had any problems with it , very additive .
this ap is among the ones i consider a mistake . there are so many others that work better . perhaps others may like it . i suggest reading a positive review . someone must like it .
love it , but can be addictive ! some levels are harder than others and can be frustrating . but overall a great low key game
this looks like a runner game for the younger generation or if you like temple run and things like that , you would probably like this game
this game is simply awesome ! ! love the pc version and the kindle version is just as good . thumbs up guys
only played a little while but cant put it down this game is great i hope i do n't have any issues with it
at first i rated it as too simple but i had n't realized that there were a lot more levels of difficulty . it is a fine game
this was a great game.i had a hard time putting it down . i wish it would have had more rooms . i finished it in a weekend . this game has some pretty advanced puzzles .
i like logos quiz better because this one is too easy my 9 year old son can play this game with no hassle but good game other than that
i like the game but i do n't like writing these reviews . can be tough . some pictures do n't make sense . i 'll figure it out .
this game is addictive . i do n't have a lot of down time so picking the right game to help me relax is important . this game fits the bill . i really like it .
something good to focus on when bored or waiting for something like an appointment or just need something to keep you busy
this games graphics are great . its a lot of fun . the third one is a lot better though . a a a a a a a a
this is a simple to use alarm . i like how it works on my kindle fire hd . i needed it for an early morning wake up on a few hours of sleep . it worked great .
this is a good game . it would be easy enough for a child to play and yet is interesting for adults .
clean master is a great app . it helps me keep my kindle fire hd running fast . this app does exactly what it claims . and does a great job of it..
this is a great game to pass some time with ... its like 3 mini games in 1 ... its a definite great game to buy
it 's very hard to move or edit items . every time i try to move or edit something everything else pops up first , especially if they are close together
okay but level one is too frustrating to advance beyond . would be very annoying for a small child or older person with vision or hand control issues .
this app has worked very well , great quality streaming videos . if you have netflix , then this app is a must .
all the kindle fire hd word games available for free were less entertaining or challenging as older kindle or kindle fire versions .
slow going and a bit boring . just not that much fun to play . i erased it after three chapters played .
this keeps you updated on the games and the scores been very good especially if you ca n't watch the games and wanted to see what the score is .
this is one of the best bingo games i have played , and i have played quite a few of them ! ! !
glad it was the free app of the day . play about 5 minutes before deleting . if you did n't get it as faotd , do n't waste your money .
just downloaded a few minutes ago , but so far i love it . i 'll do another review in a few days .
i really like this app it works great and my son loves it . the only problem with this app is that the voice . my son does not fell good about that .
i love this game ! it is very entertaining and my 3 year olds likes to play too . i only wish it did n't require neighbors to complete tasks .
will never try it again , it is just plain dumb as a rock to waste time on a stupid little animal that never seems to get anywhere .
i have been getting hooked on bingo lately and i do have to say this is one of my favorites if not my favorite . try this if you like playing bingo i think you will like it .
i got this app for my daughter who is almost 2 & amp ; 1/2 and she loves it . easy to use and no problems with the app .
i was excited to get this game , but it would not work , it kept getting locked up and i had to even shut down device and restart , other games work great - do not waste your money
the game was a little pricey but had great graphics . there were several times it froze or just quit when playing it on my kindle fire .
i started playing and though it was very easy , now i am stuck ! this is a fun , family game . i am really enjoying it .
when you spell ( not spell ) the way i do this is the best way to help me out . it does help .

it has been fun learning how to use this new app as i learn how to use my new tablet .
i hope who ever made this game might not want to make kid games they should awesome and fun games
i 'm still on level 1 and i am lost . i can usually get through these games pretty well but i do n't know what 's going on lol

i also have this on my ipod touch too and it is so fun to play in the car or at home
do n't really know what they want you to do . it looks interesting but not clear what is needed to complete the game .

i love mahjong it is a great game and i love the different levels it has . i am so glad to be able to play .

about the same as the facebook game ... nothing special ... just started and is a bit boring like playing with others does n't seem to be that way in this version .
you will get stuck playing this . it 's really great for passing time . just about like the original tetris but with a faster pass and power ups .
challenging in higher levels but doable . the graphics are simple and nice . i find this to be a great way to unwind .
i really enjoy this game , always wanting to get perfect scores . i think anyone should purchase it . where 's my water ?
this game is fun and challenging . works great on my kindle fire hd . i would recommend this game to anyone who is up for a challenge and the characters are really sweet .
it has cute people . and also can be challenging . if you like sims games you will also like this one .
interesting challenge type of mahjong which involves several steps - plus 100 layouts with background and tile sets you chose . also have a section to play continuously . good game .
i have a new kindle fire hd , every app works wonderfully , facebook does not . soooo slow ! just use the browser on your kindle . it is faster .
this app is a total waste of time . it does nothing but crack when you touch it . do n't buy this game !
my little girl was so disappointed with this app . she could n't do anything that did n't require her to unlock - spend money - something .

my daughter talked me into getting this one and i am so glad that i did ! it is so challenging and fun !
great app to download . helps you to figure out a good workout when you do not know what to do . have a video that shows you the correct form on how to do the exercises
i think it is good because its not the fake piano tiles and it is more challenging than the fake ones .
this is a fun app , very simple to use . when you 're bored it gives you something to do . very user friendly . easy to work .
i do n't love this app . i just personally think its stupid . i mean lil its crazy . the title happy poo says it all . do n't get this app
the game 's got good , but , it has to be free of charge due to it 's simple gameplay although , it does have a good story .

this is the worst calling app around text now is more recommend cause you can call and text so rate this 1 star because you just enter a number of your state and you do n't get to call anyone
but not as easy as you 'd think . some are pretty difficult . i think we deserve more than five & quot ; coins & quot ; for each correct answer though . all in all pretty fun
solid app . well designed , clean , and informative . ( thirteen words to meet the twenty count minimum . sometimes short reviews are better . )
it is called a smartphone for a reason . this app is not needed . thanks but no thanks . just use a regular task killer .
i just love playing this puzzle game . i would highly recommend this game to anyone who has a android phone . my son plays this all the time .

it 's a puzzle game but really fun ! everyone should play this awesome game ... this game is really exciting and hard but fun .

i just recently started this game , and so far it 's a great game . once i get more involved in the game i will give another review .
uninstalled dance fantastic . did not work properly . been a long time but remember it did n't have things i would use either .
you can play as long as you want to put it down and come back to it . a nice break for the day or evening .
quite useful for editing pictures on kindle . nothing too difficult , really simple interface and controls , and you can write on pictures which was what i was looking for .
my daughter likes this game because she gets to choose the makeup to apply . she would like to have more free color options available .
this app is a favorite of mine . i find it easy to navigate & amp ; explore ! thank you for creating the portable program ! ! !

i am really enjoying this bible app . it is a really good way to start your day with a quick read .
i love this , first of all you dont need the font stuff , so dont worry about that . this allows me to use it and type up documents on the go .
i like the interface . like that you can count down using seconds , minutes , or hours . simple and does the job .
a really good simulation for deer hunting and other game . it 's only downside was the fact that animals could fall through trees .
it 's ok nothing exciting about it . it does help the kids with their words but otherwise a bore . i have books for this .
my husband and i are enjoying watching it and the tv and keeping track of it all . thanks for creating it .
enjoyable game with great graphics . puzzles are doable once you figure out what you need to do to solve it . recommend it for those who like hidden object games .
i beat all 10 levels in about 45 minutes . i really enjoyed the game but they either need to add more rooms or make them more difficult .
you are able to see all your history channel favorite shows . wonderful to have an app such as this . other channels should follow suit .
great game for keeping your mind sharp ! ! ! graphics are great as well : - ) i recommend trying this game , it holds your attention , at whatever pace you desire ! ! !

the subject line says it all ! ! i had a great time using this app . only wish there were more levels ! !
i wish you could do all the things on the pc . on here you can only do so much . other wise i luv it ! it 's so cool
very simple little game , maybe a nice game for a little kid , but i have no little kids so was n't worth me loading .
this game was actually pretty fun . from the pics it looks like its not fun whatsoever but it really surprised me .
but a bit slow to work on my kindle . i do n't think i will try it again . there is n't nothing like putting a puzzle together with the family helping out while they hang out .
i found the odds to be very realistic and the advice button is a good tool for those just learning the game . even the table makes you feel like you are at the casino . well done .
this game is great it is addicting and fun it has a reward system that keeps you playing and having fun
i really like this game but it crashes on my kindle fire all the time . i have to back out and reload at least 3 times per game .
enjoy the levels in this game . it was entertaining and fun . i would recommend to everyone i know . ca n't wait for the sequel .
this works great the way you 'd hope it would . use it - enjoy it - love it ! now somebody please solve the adobe flash issue !
simple concept . hard to put down once you start playing . a good stop and go game ( waiting room time waster ) .
google has helped me many a time when i get stumped and need some answers . it is really a great app .
very fun but all the good guns cost real money and to beat the harder levels u need those good guns

i enjoyed the music and it was fast paced . very addictive , as i kept wanting to see if i could improve my score .
fun sounds and easy interface . a fun twist to bubble popping games and you do n't have to race the clock . love it .
love it hours of fun will tell all my friends and family so we can play together . and have hours of fun
i loved playing this game . it was n't that hard to follow but it was n't real easy to play . about the time i got lost the hint that was given put me back on track .
i like playing the game but when i try and do the challenges i ca n't finish them . when you do n't have friends that play you ca n't do the challenges in neighbors .
fun to play when it does n't freeze up . seems to happen during play and you lose without playing to end of round . since i play for fun it 's ok
i loved it ! this was my first game of this kind and i had a good time with it . it took some time to catch on but i found it was a pleasant way to pass time .
way too many advertisements . i certainly would not recommend it to any one who just wants a free game . nope .
love this app . works great on kindle fire . my kids love it too . keeps you busy but to advance quicker , in app purchases required .
good app : ) i like this app i like how you can translate it too it is a good app
omg , this is way different than flappy bird . but it 's still difficult and challenging , hope this helped . it is really fun though .
just discovered these types of games and i have been thoroughly enjoying them ! some of them are easy , some are harder , all of them are entertaining .

after i had my son i would be up all night with him , and i would be playing fruit devil until i fell asleep !
love the game ! very hard on some levels but you keep trying and finally you get it . hard to put down .
my daughter ( 7 ) downloaded this game and she seems to like it , do n't know that if it has any learning value .
love this game it is so much fun trying to find all of the items . they have hidden them very well . great job
good for the type of game it is but nothing special . would n't had gotten it if it was n't the free app for the day .
if you like spot the difference games , this one is fast and challenging . graphics are wonderful and the photos sometimes difficult . works great on the kindle hd fire .

this is just as good as the version for my pc . very easy to work with and no problem . all my contacts just popped up . thanks yahoo ! !
i get the same amount of news from google news , so it 's ok. there is a lot of information available .
a lot of fun for a simplistic concept . just right to make it fun yet still be challenging
my granddaughter loves to play this game when she comes to spend the night with me . she is only four years old and really gets involved with her game .
this app works well and if you like old shows and movies , it gives you something to watch , on tv , for free .
got this game for kindle fire and was amazed at what the device is able to do as far as graphics . fun game .
the only reason i 'm not giving it a 5 star review is because it is kind of simple and gets boring but if you 're looking for a good game then it is pretty fun and addicting
this app is absolutely amazingly easy to use . there is no way yahoo could of developed a better app than what they have .
i have n't got it yet but ppl alot ppl saying that its bad or good so i 'm gon na give it a try
first game that was challenging but also yet able to complete . tried them all loved this one the best ! ! ! looking forward to the upcoming levels !
that is a great game to get your brain working . i love this game and i hope that everyone plays this game one day .

i am not even sure why but i love this game and once i start playing i find myself losing hours of my day , just all around fun
i love playing this game . it is so addictive i play all the time . i cant stop playing this game .
game has good graphics . it is a pretty short game and the ending was n't what i expected . not the best click adventure game but for the price it was ok .
great game that 's definitely worth the price . i ca n't stop playing . the levels get more and more challenging . download it now you will not be disappointed .
i just cant get enough of this game . it is so addicting but in a good way . i wish there were more apps like this one . great game
it is an ok game to play while you have time to kill . it will get you thinking at times of how to solve that puzzle .
great app ! works great on my kindle fire ! ! even better that its free ! i had absolutely no problem with it at all ! !
boring boring boring boring boring and did i say boring ? this should not even be under the category of a game ! and did i mention that it is boring ?
i play a lot of this genre and this is one of the best . no glitches on my kindle fire . just enough ho scenes to get stuff . no trouble downloading .
temple run is a great game that has plenty power ups and upgrades to unlock . this game is hard to stop playing . its very addictive right from the start .
fun game and i play it for free . addictive and oh so easy to play . fun for all ages and i highly recommend it .
wouldnt purchase again my daughter had fun with it for a while but got boring after a few weeks of playing
it is fast moving , able to adjust bets to how i think the game is going ( not that i get it right ) . i play it often .
used it a couple of times then deleted it ... ... not worth the space it took . does nothing google wo n't do easier .
this is a good test for your memory . i really like it . i need any help i can get . some are so familiar , but i ca n't place them all .
i just downloaded jewels & amp ; diamonds plus and started playing for over an he . it is addicting . easy to play .
did n't hold my interest like i had expected . okay for occasional playing when i am bored of other games and i want something else to play .
just started playing an ok for being free . doing a review because they are giving me free hearts . had no problems with download or opening the game .
my sister wanted this so i said okay i enjoy the app more than her i wish some of the hair stuff works better but o well
i love dogs and i love jigsaw puzzles . so , this app is just right . i would highly recommend to anyone who loves dogs .
good games within the game , but wish it would enlarge more during ho . fun to play , but you do need to figure out the different rules . like this one ...
i did get this app , but have not downloaded it as of yet . so i can not give an honest review of it
i only went to the web site once . it is alright but it does n't give the live news like i thought it would . i 'll keep it for now .
my kids love this app , they really enjoy the theme and all the options . they are learning in a fun game setting . learning is n't `` boring '' with this app
i like playing solitaire but the ads are annoying ! there are times that i want to remove it but i do like playing it .
i love it but it is very addicting . some are very fun and easy , some are not . still have n't figured one of the cities out . another one having problems with but will keep trying .
i enjoy this app , but there is only so far you can go before they are trying to get you to pick another app like the one you just enjoyed .
this game is a lot like bejeweled . it 's fast paced and fun , but like many other reviewers , i find the ads after every game extremely annoying .
i am so excited that it finally came on kindle fire . i love it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! awesomeness . and fun . yay ! la la la
have to set a time limit otherwise i would never stop playing even my family plays whenever i let them which is n't much .
i am so so happy i downloaded this game . it gives me hours and hours of entertainment . even my kids love this game . you 'll never get bored with it !
this was a neat idea and i like to download movies , just wish they would add more tv shows to the list of downloads . that would have been great to catch up on shows during my flight .
this is a good game for strategy and figuring out puzzles . you have to review and like to get free hints , but that 's ok .
this is a really fun game to play if you want to kill time , really makes you think . and it 's really worth the price . works great on my kindle fire
it 's okay but i have others i prefer . there is not a pause , so you can not deal with interruptions . the tile colors are very boring ,
fun and easy to pick up . challenging game play , but not so much so that it is annoying to play .
so far it has been fun ! i liked all the options you could have such as picking different background etc .
this product is okay . i might recommend it to others . i thought that there could have been more content to choose from however .
i enjoy the game , but , it is a little difficult for the grandchildren . keep up the good work with word games .
i really like this game ! something to keep me busy while watching tv ! not too hard and yet is still addicting !
this dictionary is fast on the kindle fire , does n't require a network , and is accurate . i do n't see why it is n't used more .
i just wish it was longer . it was a good first game and i look forward to the next one .
i love this app . if you are a runner , this is for you . i 've enjoyed the free version for months now . get this free today , even though it 's worth the ten bucks .
rummy mobile was okay . it took too long to play . difficult getting started and rules difficult to understand . would not reccomend .
so far i like the game have always been a smurf fan . the game is fairly fast paced and has great graphics .
my grandkids play this one too . i do n't see them on it as much as the dinosaur hunter but they do play it
if you like room escape type games you will like the game . if you want extra levels you have to buy with coins .
i like playing this game its challenging and lt lets you continue playing until you advance to the next level , you do not have to wait like some of the other games to get lives back
it was a two step process to search the internet before the google install now it is a one touch app and faster time as well .
was hard to get her to hit things , timing seemed to be off , got rid of it so did n't my daughter and granddaughter
i chose this because it looked like a fun game , but once you 've played it , it 's not the kind of game you keep going back to play again .
here 's another game that you do the same thing over and over to get more energy to continue the game . boring !
i love this game it is a good airplane game , you should get this game right the second your done reading this review .
never really used the app much ! the few times i did it worked pretty good ! i need up just installing it !
no issues with this game . doesnt freeze or stick . doesnt ask for cash to continue to play . i love bingo games . very pleased .
challenging game options . lots of game time . can replay without becoming easily bored . i have played f or several hours and still have multiple puzzles to beat .
kids and & # 34 ; big people & # 34 ; love it , too . fun for star wars fans and angry bird fans . fun game for all in the family .
i like other games better . not real easy to navigate . i like jewel quest solitare better . play board is simple .
i have never played this game but my daughter has i think . i 'm not for sure if she liked it or not . she likes most drawing games so i guess she liked it .
have the mac version on my ipad and could n't live without it on my phone .
cant rotate the pieces no matter how many times i tap the pieces . i. want my money back . do n't like . it . when i. get charged for junk .
everyone needs to try out the ai apps . i find them very intuitive and entertaining . i could play for hours .
i love playing this game . a lot of fun pictures and keeps the mind thinking . my son and l love playing it together .
that 's all i want to do is watch , but it want let me watch them . i do n't no what i 'm doing wrong .
no problems playing on my kindle fire . story is interesting and graphics were good . this is one game i 'll keep and replay .
this is my first kindle game and so far it 's just what i wanted : an easy , fast game to exercise different parts of my brain .
wow this app is awesome ! i wish there were more games like this in the world ! the app icon is cool to !
this is a great app for kids , but not so great for adults . it gets old fast because it is very easy to do .
i have no idea why you people are saying this takes up space and freezes ? ! ? ! ? ! it does n't ! ! ! have a nice day . = )
my kids love this app and they have learned a lot from it . i would highly recommend this app for toddlers .
i have had no problems with this app . works very well on my kindle . i had tried a couple of other youtube apps that did not work at all .
my cat enjoyed it at first but got bored after a few times . amusing for a while and made me laugh at my cat . worth the 99 cents
i have played this game before in the other version . i enjoy playing it , it 's great to spend time away from the daily work . i would recommend this game .
this was my first hidden object game . i enjoyed playing it for a while , but there are other games that hold my attention for a longer time . it 's a nice game to return to occasionally .
love this alarm clock ... if your like me and press snooze in your sleep this is perfect for you . you can set it to make you answer math questions before you hit snooze ! !
this is a terrible app it is way to fast pace and has no controls this game might as well be made from a two year old do n't waste your time like i did .
long , complex game with a good story line . so much better than the other hidden object games i 've played .
great soundtrack and gameplay . my only complaint is that is has very few levels . other than that its fun and free so get it !
this is a fun and easy game . it takes fruit ninja to a whole different level . good for all ages !
the only bad thing , really is the fact that you have to buy hints when you want them . it is fairly good though .
this was not worth the trouble of downloading it . i know that it was free , but someone should pay us for ever trying to play these games . i would not recommend these to anyone .
i like this game . you can ask friends to help when you get stuck . some of the puzzles are a little tricky !
i love this game its fun and adicting ... but you get sick of the same tracks but i would still suggest getting it
i love it ! ! i do wish you would get a version of candy crush too . this games plays well on the tablet .
i cant seem to stop playing this game . it is really really really fun to play . my kids love to play also .
they only give you a few free games and those are all small boards , but they are a nice little time killer .
i love mahjong , i even play it on pogo . and its in my favorites . one of the best games out there .
the game is pretty challenging . it sucks you in and ends up addicting . very fun to play with friends and family or alone . it makes you think outside the box ...
weird animal combinations but fun to try and figure them out . really a challenge when you do n't recognize either animal .
the game is awesome . i love that i can do it with my family and figure out the logos . i think that every one should get this game .
i like a game to be challenging but when you ca n't pass a level after playing for 3 days -- -- -- its not fun any more .
i could n't see what titles they had available , so it was n't worth downloading it 's crazy that you ca n't see what to purchase no point in downloading it 's a waste of time
no other app or game has ever shut down or take so long to load for my kindle its great to play but it sucks that i cant play it much maybe 5 minutes a day if im lucky
this game is so stupid but i love it so much . it is do addicting and i can not stop playing it .
this game was free for my kindlefire . it is a lot of fun and something i can play with family , even grandkids like it .
the game is fun but i get too many pop up advertisements between levels . the add said it would be ad-free when and how do i get the adds off ?
i had this game on my android and downloaded it onto the kindle for the kids and they absolutely love it ( i do too ) .
awesome list that is . this one is a keeper . it holds my interest on the bus and other waiting places
great game so far will continue to play to see what happens . will let you all know very soon how i like the game and if it 's worth playing .
i like to play dice games and yahtzee is ok , but the other two games would n't work so i deleted it .
this is different than most games of this type . you get coins everyday . never seen that with any other games . great way to kill time .
love it . happy its finally on kindle cant wait for the rest of the king apps . i cant get enough .
i play this game on my phone and it does great but on my kindle fire it keeps stopping and making me force close it . please fix this ! will change rating to five star when fixed .
our 2 1/2 yr old granddaughter really likes puzzles and these are right up her alley . she has worked them over and over again .
i enjoyed playing this game . it was fun and different from anything else i 'd ever tried . very entertaining . thank you for the fun .
this app is a rare one where you actually have to think to try figure it out . i loved the fact that the riddles are n't so easy that it 's basically just wasting time .
helps practice your game for real life . it is a fun time filler when u need to kill some time .
i am retired and this is a great thinking game . my grandchildren also love to play this game . i play this game all the time .
does n't really compare to other apps such as animal planet , a & e , history channel but some folks will like it anyway .
just for fun to have . checking our scans and see what it all means around us , and others to see
oh my god . i love this app so much and i ca n't believe i waited this long to finally buy it . but i hate when it tells you that you 're out of lives . : (
this app is very bad . it has bad graphics and you might as well buy the real cut the rope . its worth the 0.99 cents .
it 's a awesome app . i enjoy it because it is rather challenging , more so then the other logo games i play . i rate it a four n a half out of five
i hate this game . it is the worst game in the world ! i hate this game i just cant stop saying how much i hate this game .
the game is was okay . i did n't enjoy this game very much . it was n't as they had described it . i did n't like it .
i give all apps 3 star when they dont work on my tablet . it did seem like a great app which is why i downloaded it
it 's a cute game . also easy for my youngest to navigate and play without having to read anything ( he ca n't read yet ) . love the cute little animals too !
cool game i like the sounds cause they are really awesome and funny . you should get this app because it is cool
this game is really fun and addicting . i recommend this game to anyone who has a lot of time to burn ! ! ! ! !
good game for basic knowledge of everyday phrases . wish they would either make the hints cheaper or give more tokens .
this game is the best for any age . i 'm 18 and love it . it is so funny and i ca n't stop laughing when i play it .
this is one of the games you play to help pass time quickly . my wife has it on all the time .
this app could surely be & quot ; bingo heaven & quot ; ! ! ! thanks a bunch . : ~ ) i have been searching for a good bingo app but could not find anything i liked .
it takes too much time and energy to get stars . it 's seems like it really moves slow and does n't want you to finish . needs to be improve .
this app is ok , but i do n't think that its as good as a similar bird land . do n't get me wrong , its pretty cool but it gets boring after a while .
fun simple app that is addicting and just a simple concept . vivid colors and changing levels keep it fun
it seems like a more fun kid friendly temple run with some different twists . it is really addicting and good for killing time . just try it : its free anyway . it is so so fun and amazing
love this app . there are so many recipes on it and it takes up so little space on my kindle .
i do n't really use this at all . i got it to entertain my niece while she was here for the holidays . it was not all that i thought it would be .
this game was awesome i just wish i could have played more but i have to buy it the rest of to play it .
it not that good but it is okay to look up something fast that you wanted t look at on google .
love being able to check the weather in various places . prefer the old version as it is easier to use
super well made with a lot of extras to unlock so glad its now on my kindle fire a must have time waster
lots of fun ! meet lots of nice people ! entertaining for hours ! lets you explore your creative side ! makes getting up fun !
love this game helps them see that doctors are not bad for the ... . that the doctors just help them feel better
this is a good game and the help is very informative . i love these mystery games and always like the challenges that this game has . i would recommend the game to anyone who likes these mystery games .
i love bingo anyway . i especially love it when they come up with different and exciting ways to make it more interesting . this is fun
because of the teacher in this game i have learned a few new words ! ! this game is great for my kindle fire !
my daughter loves this app . all my kids have used this app to increase their vocabulary beyond other kids their age .
i hate this game cuz i think its to slow and the graphics sick eggs ! i like the original temple run but not this one . i suggest not to get it .
this seems like a cute game . i think my grandkids will like it . wish these games did n't rely so much on purchasing things with real money .
i love this app it keeps me posted on one of my favorite shows , recommend it to all , great app..
my little niece loves playing dress up and this app has some adorable clothes and items . although it would n't kill to add in a few more things .
i really did not like this app at all . there just was n't enough there for me . thanks for trying but it was n't good enough for me .
i love all mahjong games . it 's great to have them all on my kindle . i can use it in my down time or when i 'm on vacation .
once you start you just do n't want to stop playing . once you get stopped you ca n't wait to be able to play again . it 's a good game .
i love this game . with all the games available i come back to this one again and again . i love the bonus games and tournaments allowing you to play more .
enjoyable game . liked better than some games of this genre . however , not like other hidden objects which have a mystery type plot .
i have downloaded this application but as of yet have not used it for any other application or necessary system .
bike race is awesome it is worth the money and it 's very cool . you can connect on multiplayer and play with your friends .
it 's a wonderful game for young and old ! i have it on my kindle fire , with no issues at all ! if you like classic games get this one ! ! !
grandson loves to see how fast i can get the paper off of the roll , then is more than happy when he beats my time !
we are still learning how to play this application but my kids still like it and the are learning how to get the ball to hit the bubbles .
this app is okay but for inspiration would recommend everyone to read your bible ... ... this app is alright , i would recommend i guess .
i have had this app for a long time and it has been so helpful in my weight loss quest .
easy to play ; once you start playing , you wo n't be able to stop . very entertaining for a lot of ages .
easier than the previous battery monitor i had which seemed to cause problems . lots of user friendly features . try it
although i enjoy playing this game , it is n't quite as enjoyable as i thought it would be . it is n't quite what i expected when i ordered it .
this is a nice app , sometimes very accurate , i think overall i like it . would recommend just for the fun of it .
my kids have enjoy this game they like that it is easy to travel with since it 's digital . lots of fun .
this is a fun game . all of the , ads that pop up are a bummer , but other than that , it is a fun game .
this is a great program that works well on a computer as well as the kindle fire hd . it really is a nice aid to reading emails .
if you get this app you will quickly realize that after one time of playing it you will be willing to do . chores or go to work rather than play .
this game is really fun ! pretty easy , but some of them are a little challenging ! over all i like it ! so try it out
i suggest that you get this . it is fun and makes you think , but not so hard that it is impossible . i have truly enjoyed this game .
i first playing chef 2 and thought it was fun . i finish , that game and want to try this one . i think this one is okay it need some improvements and wish animation were little better .
i love it . it presents a challenge and i do n't want to put it down . it 's like the pac-man game i had years ago .
i opened it after downloading it for my eight year old daughter ... now i ca n't put it down ! maybe my daughter will get to play it !
erased it but it might have been another app cook book i meant to erase so try and see if this is the lame one .
i absolutely love this game ! in fact all of the big fish games that have the same theme are awesome ! i would recommend . this to anyone .

really enjoyed the game . the story kept my interest throughout the entire game . looking forward to the sequel . job well done .

i am not too sure about this game . my grand daughter down loaded it but did not like it and moved on to others right away .
really like this one . stopped playing angry birds to play cut the rope through . runs great on my galaxy s3 .
a great game for learning how words have more than one meaning . a good way to waste away a rainy day .
wont take too much time for this review , the game is not too good , still needs some heavy work , i cant say i like it and got bored pretty fast .
i played it on facebook at first . i got it set for my facebook friends . it 's good to play still and not be on facebook when you want to play with friends still .
i thought it was gon na be a fun game it 's a puzzle how stupid it does n't even say that it 's a puzzle it looks like you put makeup on people do n't get the app
match 3 games keep thinking and make me use my brain . i am retired so not a lot of things make me think a lot .
i love this game . lots of twist and interesting story line . puzzles and quests are just hard enough to be fun , not frustrating . ca n't wait for more .
i was prepared for this app to be a normal type of escape app . but it was much more challenging and in some places did not solve like i thought it would . very interesting and fun .
it has very basic options and i 'd like to see a little more , but it 's great to see a percentage when your phone does n't offer that on it 's own .
very fun and somewhat addictive . its a time killer and has somewhat ok graphics for a tablet . not willing to pay but today its free .
this is the most awesomeness app ever it is addicting and will keep you entertained for hours this games and minecraft are both games i would totally recommend for you

really keeps your mind and hands moving to play this game , never a dull moment with this buy it buy it
this is wonderful . can add your own graphics and wake up to the music you love . has a snooze and two different alarm times . also give you the weather . it 's the best .
a brain teaser that makes u really exercise your brain . a good brain training tool . sometimes it is n't what u might think at first so do n't give up
this is a quality game . the controls are solid . graphics could be better ... .but overall i think everybody should at least give the game a shot . kudos to the devs .
this is a fun game although eventually one runs out of the free episodes and has to pay for additional games .
got old after a while and once finished did not want to do it again . not quite what i had expected .
the bonuses for this game are fun and the log in bonus es are huge but you have to bet a lot to play the games .
the machines are paying good . a great way to pass time . the graphics are great . the bonus game and free spins are entertaining . like the messages sent while you are playing
my toddler really likes this game it doesnt have that many different puzzles though . they really need to update it and add more .
i love this game so much . i play it all the time . but once you get better at it , it gets harder .
fun game . some of the pictures are blurry making it hard to see the faces and there are way too many ads

it is really cool and great for horse lovers i love this game this game is fun to play and i love it
temple run 2 is the best one yet i made it to the mine place . love the game . on temple run 3 they should put a mode for multiplayer action . that would be awesome .
it plays the song good with the lyrics on the the screen . but ... ... it only plays the songs on the device . not any song
it is so boring all you do is click a candy and that 's all it is so boring you ca n't do anything do n't get it you will be bored of it in three seconds do n't get

this game has an interesting plot as well as variation of game play . i am usually not a big fan of hidden object games i am enjoying this one .
this is a great thinking and puzzle solving game . it reminds me of the 100 floors game but i like this game better . my only problem with it is that i wish there were more levels .

this game is fun and addictive some words are easy and some you really have to think about in each level

i like this app a lot . it entertains me as a lot of small things do . but after awhile i get kinda bored with it and run out of ideas to do .
this can be used as a fun way to brush up on math skills , for all ages . for those who do n't care for math , give this a try .
love the challenge . nice relaxing game to play while i am sitting in front of the tv . like the many different patterns offered .
no idea what this is as i only downloaded this to get a free mp3 song credit added to my amazon mp3 credit balance .

my son thinks this is a fun app , the animations make him laugh . i don ' t know that i like it enough to buy the full version though .
i have n't played this game very often , but when i do , i will let you know how i like it .
apparently whoever designed this game did not try it out on a kindle . the objects are way too small to see on that size screen .
i love this game . it works good on my kindle fire hd . it is really fun . this game is awesome and some games are really challenging and some are really easy .
this app does only a swipe back and forth . it looks neat but i was over it in 10 seconds . so was my 11 year old . dumb .
may entertain the kids but is really annoying to me . i can find better stuff to do with my time .
enjoyed this game very much ! i must be old or slow because it took me longer to finish than some of the other reviews said !
love this game . i like having a game that does n't require online access . it can be relaxing if you play classic or you can up your game by playing against the clock .
this is the best app for controlling the sound for every thing on the kindle every one that has one should get this app you will love it as much as i do
kept me thoroughly entertained . i liked that it provided clues or i would have lost interest after being stumped the first time . ca n't wait for additional rooms ! ! ! ! ! !

fun to play this game . i wish that i could get more free credits to play longer and level faster
this game is awesome ... i just started it and i like it . i recamend this game to many girls . i love i !
i hate this app because it wo n't let me sign in . it said it did n't recognize my password or email .
day i got it i played 11 races . pretty nice . now today is my 2nd day trying to play but it keeps crashing while loading . ended up deleting it .
i got this app for my husband 's phone . i tried it out and could n't put it down . so much fun ! you have to try it .
i have been playing this game for a long time and i can not get enough of this game . i wish we could get more gems instead of using real money .
one of the harder ones . lots of fun and good for kids . we can play together and it really gets harder as you go along .
i tried and i tried and i could n't figure out how to set an alarm . which by the way was the only thing i needed !
very easy puzzles . not very challenging . fun to do when you have a short time and ca n't be reading a book .
good game that is interesting but not too easy . one you win some lose some similar to real slots . good for those doctor office waits .
good game . easy to play and good for most ages . i would recommend this game to anyone who needs something to do in there spare time .
so far this app seems very intuitive . would be curious to see how the full version works if i ever get it . just have n't had much of a reason yet .
i like the hidden object games and this one is okay but the object are hard to see on a kindle . i still like it and will play it often .
i love your game it is so cool i think every body should play game i love this game i love it !
after my 7 year old enjoying a different puzzle game , i added this one to our apps . it 's good . i 'll recommend it to anyone who wants to keep their kid busy .
i got this as a free app from amazon and found myself playing it way too much . very addictive game .
great game i like it you should get it out is fun to play and enjoy the fun it is great for all ages fun fun fun fun fun fun challenging and great fun
it will not open please fix so i can actually play the game if u fix it i will update my review
this game is neat . very fun and challenging . if you like detective type games you 'll like this ... very entertaining ! like the graphics .
great calculator app ! love that you can edit it to make paying bills so much easier . would love a send to printer mode .
nice graphics . i enjoyed figuring out the order to use the objects and searching for hidden codes . my only complaint , to few levels . : )
only okay ... not my thing maybe . it is so well liked everywhere , i tried it and just could n't get into it .
great game love playing it . would play with friends but i 'm not on facebook . so i like to play by myself . it 's fun .
i really like these games a lot . i enjoy them because they are not fast paced . i play a lot of those on my xbox so its nice just to slow down .
it was fun , but it was a little difficult to see . it got a little boring after a few games it was a little slow moving ,
this is an addictive game . you keep trying to beat each level even if you have to start over . great for helping concentration
at first this is hard to play on the kindle fire but you get used to it . get this while it is at a low price or you will miss out !
every thing is cute and great and fun also awesome . great clothes shoes are awesome too just great this app rocks the house
this game is not what i expected . with this particular version you do not get any hints . you must pay for the hints , so if you get stuck you are out of luck
i love mega jump but it took a little while for it to load . otherwise the loading it was awesome and really fun to entertain kids
it did not have stuff telling you how to start to play th e game . if you never played it you a 're lost at a horse race .
it cost too much to play more than one card every time i signed on . i did n't like this game !
my son loves this app ! perfect . for car rides and waiting rooms . he loves that he gets to touch and hear all the sounds !
this is not to bad a game . it is better than i thought it would be . it is also easier than i thought too .
very good game . probably even better than cut the rope . very challenging and smart . so cute and nice a a a a a
it 's , a great app with nice graphics and beautiful color . i enjoy the games . it has good pay outs also . i recommend this app for sure !
i let my grandson pick this out and he loves it.i 'm a word game person or logic puzzle person .
downloaded the free version and upgraded to the full version a day later . fun time management game like diner dash , etc .
its the same game i got it for my little girl and when it was done loading it was the same game
find myself playing this game a lot ! it gives you three themes to choose from , the graphics are crisp . very fun !
game is frustrating , the clues are lacking and now i 'm stuck . please fix this issue for samsung galaxy s ii .
this app is good to have when you need to look up the weather . the graphics are very good and clear .
i love this game it is fun and all that until u cant do anything then u have to start over boo
my granddaughter likes this app . she thinks the sounds are funny . she put it on my kindle so i could hear it and laugh with her .
it is fun and entertaining for all adults and something one should think about when checking games out entertaining entertaining
i love the idea and everything but their are times when i have to catch the song all over again but other than that i love this app .
i 'm probably one of the only people who do n't enjoy temple run , but i ca n't stand this game . i can see why it 's popular , but not my cup of tea .
it is easy , yet challenging enough to be addictive and fun ! a free app , that is worth actually paying for !
too difficult to play on my kindle which is what i used to download this app . maybe better in some other medium .
i was happy with the way facebook worked on my kindle . i felt i received as much info as if i logged in on my pc
i got this app for free on the amazon market and it is very addictive . it is hard to beat your own high score after a while , but it is still fun .
i have played many similar games . with this game i really like the different levels , and getting the egg to bottom to clear the level .
easy to play . fun for the whole family . get to play with friends online . or random with people . can play at your own pace .
omg one of the best realistic game ever . just like having your own fish : - ) love it . if you love this game like me also try bird land amazing too : - )
neat way to have fun with colors . easy to play and can be relaxing at the same time . great time passer with nice music to boot . very simple challenge .
this is my new favorite game . it gas cute graphics , interesting elements and it challenges your thinking . i would give it 6 stars if i could .
this app does what it says , however someone like me would find a normal everyday calculator more useful . filler . filler . filler .
this is a great free game .. my whole family is addicted to playing ! we ca n't wait until we can choose to play against each other instead of only playing random people
this app is great . i 'm having so much fun with it . i 'd like to see more like it . great job .
this game is sooooooo addicting i cant stop playing it even though you have to upgrade to get better its good im writing random things i like trains
fun game with plenty to do to keep you busy and go back and check on later . havent had to spend real money which is important .
love this game . it makes you think so you learn to think ahead . my granddaughter loves it and i feel she is learning something while she is playing it .
addictive game play makes this app a time consumer . it has the arcade carnival feel you would expect . slightly more info about the puzzle screen would have been nice .
very impressive app ! definitely worth the download ! lots of weather information in a very attractive format . this app has improved quite a bit over the years !
easy n fun t play . very intuitive and easy to operate . easy mode takes a 10 minutes t complete . good brain game .
i like this game . passes time and makes you think . only thing is hints costs way too much . besides that its worth having
i like this game a lot . the basic bubbles rotate as you match them and so it becomes more of a challenge . i had no problem connecting to facebook .
for those who beginning with meditation this is a great app for you ! ! helps you to get started and what to do .
enjoyed the story line and puzzles . most of all had no glitches on my kindle fire which says a lot for some of the apps that have come out recently ... enjoy ... .
i got this app by mistake . i did n't really want it . how can i get it off my kindle ? thanks !
it is great for when i am not near my phone . i love movies and it is an easy way to keep on top of the movies i want to see .
it is a cool app , and fun to play with , mostly for the grandkids but interesting if you like the stars and want to identify them .
kids loved it , especially the younger ones . would like to see more like this , without ads of course . thank you
i love to play hidden object games , the holiday graphics are very nice . i recommend this game to anyone who loves playing mahjong .
it crashes and there no buttons and is glitchy and i do n't like it waste of my money and you have to click around just to play just for it to crash again
great game . good for families . fun and educational at the same time . i recommend this game to anyone who l who loves word games
love this game . i play when i get up and before i go to sleep . hard to win put that 's what makes you keep on playing try it i know you will like it .
i 've been playing this game on my iphone for a long time , i was so happy to get it on my kindle ! it 's challenging and fun , very addictive ... love it ! !
its alright , i was to impatient to enjoy it . perhaps you will . perhaps you will become as awesome as awesomeness does .
this one is very , very good also . i like how you move all over . good thought process on this one .
its a good game but if you do not know how to play you will find yourself frustrated fast . if you are willing to learn you will have hours of enjoyed play time .
good game to keep you thinking my granddaughter who is 8 years also had fun trying to solve the puzzles . it is a game where you keep going and going . lots of fun .
this is a great game as well . this game makes you think fast . this game is the greatest game to have while waiting on an appointment or just need to pass time .
i really like this app . it is very easy to use . i use it more than i thought i would ! ! so yea go get this app ! ! ! ! : d
this free app is fun and works just like a las vegas slot would , minus the free drinks and the loss of your money .
this game is very addicting and very challenging . it has some easy ones along the way , but the hard ones really rack your brain .
i enjoy bubble games . i did n't give it five stars because i like bubble worlds better . it works well on the kindle and is fun to play .
i enjoyed this game so much i could n't put it down . i put it on my nieces kindles too . love it !
this was certainly a different story line then most adventure games . very well done and worth the money . had no issues playing it on kindle hdx . would definitely purchase another game made by them .
it is one of the good games for kids to play . i have enjoyed playing this game for hours and i do n't have to wait long in doctor 's office lol !

this game is fun and makes you think in order to come up with the right solution . i really like it .
this game would n't work on my sons android tablet i tried a couple different things but could n't get it to work so i uninstalled it
i think i needed to be familiar with these types of games to enjoy it without having to find directions online and follow them .
i love this app . it has fun levels and their challenging . super fun and it will test your knowledge and skill . i do recommend you get it : )
kids ages 2 & 4 love this . they dance to the songs a nd watch the videos . love to find the objects .
kids enjoy this game . glad to have free games like these for the little ones . thanks again to those putting the free ones out there
movement is to slow , had trouble playing the game . did n't much like the faces of the other players on the side of the screen . not my type of cheap play .
love it , could use more hints though , it takes a few moments of intense concentration to find some of the items , like getting items needed to advance in other levels ! ! great game .
do n't have access to listening to this a lot but when i do it is fun . always something funny going on
my girls love this game . they just use all their energy and have to wait to play again the next day .
good sudoku app for kindle fire ... it helps pass time for the sudoku lover . i love the extreme ones
scared , scared , scared , i wo n't be able to sleep at night like the time i tried high school of the dead . & gt ; & lt ; i hate zombies .
it 's a cute game but i dont like how some quest require that you have to buy clothing in order to complete them .
i tried using this app to print but could n't get it to work . it 's not very user-friendly and i would n't use it again .
very fun game . good combination of both types of cartoon wars . great upgrades and fun gameplay . need to work to get better stuff . great !
game worked great and was fun also on my kindle fire . this lite version was short but enough to get me interested in the full version for the future .
i really like this game . it 's very easy to use and i 've played it several times since i downloaded it !
i really liked this game . the story awesome and it picture was great . the puzzles was n't to hard . i ca n't wait for the second one ! ! !
christmas pics : good pictures . i like being able to scroll through the slide show . great variety of different subject matter .

this is a terrific game on any pad . hrs of fun . my grandkids love it . great entertainment when waiting in long lines
deleted bingo world 2 minutes after downloading . not fun . save yourself time , find another game to kill your time . have a nice day
a perfect game to kill a few hours ! it is playable by both the young and old and will be enjoyed by both .
its fun for the most part but what most people do n't usually put is u can go to options and learn to play one of the songs listed . so i think it is fun
i love this app there are lots of different songs to choice and listen to i love it and hope you all will like it too !
i think this app might just be my favorite . i love guessing and the more u get the more levels u have . its super fun i really like this app .
this is a great game . just download and play the free game then decide if you like it . it is that simple . you have to make up your own mind . you can always hit delete .

love this game , works great on my kindle fire hd with no issues . fun and always has stuff to do including a mini game that is way fun !
i have always wanted a horse and this game is so so so so so so so so so so cute ! ! !
do you like angry birds and star wars ? then this is the game for you ! ! it is full of wonderful star war themes ! !
huge numbers make it easy to use . i love that it is truly free ! no glitches as of yet & i use it at work all the time !
i did n't care for the game . it did n't make sense to me . enjoyed the scenes . maybe it is for a younger group .
this is the best golf app i 've played . i got it free but worth s buck any day . so get it now .
it 's an okay game , good thing it was free for i would have never paid money to buy it . i will however keep it on for my granddaughters .
my son loves playing chess and checkers on the board games so now he loves playing them on his kindle as well .
this game is awesome and i love playing it on my ipod but since i play my kindle more i was very happy to find out this game is on amazon . awesome game and good graphics
did n't play it at all . if the slots are not like or similar to real casino slots , i do n't play them .
i have used pandora on my phone and i love it . the talk shows are awesome . yes , definitely recommend this to everyone of any age .
i choose a 5 star rating because pandora is a great ap to have to listen to music and no complaints about how it works . would recommend to all .
i got very bored very fast . reminds me of simple little games from my childhood 15 years ago . cool app .
i really love playing slots ! and not spending my own money is even better ! ! ! try it ! you will like it ! really !
just started , but it seems fun so far . so i gave it four stars for now . i may update this at a later date .
this is a great app have all of the team lava games and do n't listen to the bad reviews saying : its not free i got purchases only stupid people that do n't have a brain would say that
i know this sounds weird but this app is very accurate for me i do n't know what it is but the mood scanner always seems to know how i feel
really fun game . it is cool . you can run and hop from train to train . it 's kinda like temple run ! !
the artwork is n't very good . no fun . not worth the effort . took it off my device . way to simple for adults ... might be okay for elementary ages .
wonderful game . entertaining with great graphics ! the best part of this game is that it 's not overly challenging which makes it so difficult to play .
some of these are pretty challenging . a fun game for when you have a few minutes and want a quick game to pass the time .
this is a fun and quick paced game that really gets your mind working . this game will keep you on your toes .
could use a way to share with others , the good word is not meant to keep to your self : - )
this is one of the funnest and funniest games i 've ever played , i absolutely love it and recommended it for everyone ... .
it is not a bad app . for people who are really into watching new and old tv shows . i like it !
i have watched a few shows and have not had any problems so far . it 's nice to have this app when you have several shows on you want to watch at the same time . thanks abc
i spent hours and hours playing this game . very addictive and easy to play . great game to pass the time .
nice hidden object game for free . good graphics g5 does a nice job ! tried other hidden object games by other outfits but g5 makes the best
love diner dash and all of flo 's adventures . i find them fun and entertaining just wish the free game came with a few more levels .
i love the graphics and the christmas theme is wonderful , my only complaint would be is that there are so many levels to reach to unlock the next game .
have always played hearts and with this game am learning spades before getting together with friends it 's lots of fun .
i have n't tried any of these recipes yet , but i hardly ever do try anything new . i just like having these recipes in case i ever want to .
i really like all the sims games and was happy when i found out they allowed one for the kindle . it downloaded pretty quick and did n't take long to set up .
my grandson used my tablet and played the a lot over his christmas break . would definately recommend for the little guys that love the action
this is a very entertaining game and very relaxing . you get to use you reflexes . i am a garfield fan and really love this game .
i love this game ! ! ! it 's so cool . i never run out of energy that 's the best part ! ! ! my 3 yr old grandson loves the fishing game !
this app is really fun i am only rating this because that 's the only way i can open the other board
i just ca n't wait to get home to play this game . i 've never been one to play games but i do like this .
ive always wanted to play the sims and now they 've finally come up with this great quality fun and free app ! i love it .
i like the look and functionality of this app . i 'm yet to use it in the field , but am sure i 'm going to use it a lot !
fun and entertaining for all ages . it does have in app purchases but you do n't need them to enjoy playing and building a city . con is that they are no longer updating this app .
i should have never got this app because i just love it . you get to shop and window shop . love it !
this is a very nice light , select colors and allows to use some very nice features of the device i did n't know where there
i 've had this app for more than a year now and i think it is great ! i find 1 or 2 free new books on it every day .
it 's very easy and fun . i have many games like it but this one is the best . i reccomend it to anyone .
i 've tried these games before but could n't ' understand them . the instructions did the trick . great game to relax with . good job guys .
i really enjoy playing this game . i find it more interesting than the games that begin with all four pictures showing . i definitely recommend it .
easy to use and i just highlight the word with my finger to color it . if you like this type of word search , this is great .
it is ok but i dont play it very much dont have the time to play every game all the time but it seems nice when i play . i have the ads
it 's free so give it a try . so far i 've played the puzzle game . it 's free , you get what you pay for ... or do n't pay for : - )
has three options to choose from and the scratch play is simple . odds of winning something are fairly high . wish you could buy additional tickets with your winnings . otherwise , game play is repetitive .
i like a lot of things about but what i did not like was that it is hard to navigate threw that app .
really the best movie quiz i have ever played . i recommend it to everyone . also it looks easy but it 's not so easy you get bored of it .
this game is entertaining and amusing . it lasts a long time . also , you do n't need to pay extra money to go on .
i am really enjoying this game ! this is the second g5 game that i 've tried and if you like adventure games , i totally recommend it !
this is a challenge game and a mind game . this is so much fun to play , helps your mind work and concentrate .
this is a really good game ! i love the challenge and difficulties that it brings ! if you 're on the edge of downloading this game please do .
i might learn to like it if i can find out what to do with it . i need more information
i honestly love this game a lot , but now whenever i log on to the game , it takes about 10 minutes to load , and the game is always updating !
boring to say the least . plus even though it free app , it wants you to purchase coins to play . nope ... not for me .
i love this game it is the game i play all day long i also play minecraft you should get that game it is really fun it just got the update .
easy and fun to play , hard to see more that 2 cards at a time , like having objectives to work on as you play game
i 'm enjoying this game it is not real difficult but that 's all right its quite entertaining . i would recommend it to a friend .
my nieces love this , they older one is getting a bit too old for it but the younger one just ca n't get enough !
this game if fun and challenging . it is much harder than a previous version that i have and i like the challenge .
i love this app i mean it has great graphics and it is fun so you should definitely get it
i like this game and will play the second one soon . i will probably get more of their other games .
loaded fine but i could n't get it to work at all + it seemed to mess up my screen resolution until i un installed it .
my kids love this game on the kindle fire . keeps their attention and engaging . have not had any issues or problems with the game loading or freezing up . really worth it for kids ! !
this game is fun and entertaining for both the kids and myself . if you like minion 's you will enjoy this game .
my 4 year old son and 6 year old daughter love playing this . they find it entertaining and as a mom it is not violent in any way so i do not mind them playing it .
puzzles are not too difficult , and just challenging enough to keep you coming back for more ! very entertaining . clear pictures and easy to learn how to play .
this game is good for beginners and pro 's . many starting games.i got it for me . and my 6 year old granddaughter plays great .
it 's a great fun game that you can play when you 're bored and its a good time consumer . but some of the logos are pretty hard .
this game offers variety and opportunities to win . it 's simply relaxing and enjoyable ! provides a positive experience . i recommend it !
i love the game , graphics and general design . the breeding is a bit frustrating ... might just be me , lol . great job , guys .
i love it and to be honest i 'm only on the third level just got it and i like it already so addicting .
i played the game for hours , took a break and was right back playing , thanks for this one , i really enjoy it .
the water seems to run out quickly . maybe a few more seconds would help on the more difficult levels while playing .
this is a great game . i have a couple of friends who now enjoy this game to .
this is the best thing for online information always send you to the right thing who every made this thank you so much for making this online search
my two and a half year old son loves it ! he hardly ever sits still , but with shape builder , he 'll sit for at least 30 min .
this is a fun game . a little challanging as well . it keeps me entertained . i would recommend it to everyone .
i purchased the candy crush saga game for my enjoyment . it is so much fun . it is a great game and i highly recommend it .
cute game , keeps my kids entertained for a little while . it is a good one for practicing colors and following directions .
the app is pretty good . i wish it could open from the browser or that links would open in the app , but overall its a good app . worth . the $ 2 for sure .
sorry not a fan , too simple and not challenging . played for a few minutes then deleted .
the free app game is entertaining but it has a limited amount of levels to play with hints that are available .
good graphics . lots of variations . becomes more challenging as you progress . very addictive . am having a great time with it . good purchase .
this game is fun and i really like the touch control i would recommend playing . feels like the real thing .
i 'm hooked on this game . it 's really easy though . i miss not having candy crush saga on my kindle hd , so this is the next closest thing .
i love playing bingo , but this is a great bingo . love free coins . i play everyday . i give this game five stars .
i just want them to fix the time to load game . it is a fun game.i love strategy games so much . this is another great game !
awesome ! i have tried a lot of tap the black tile games but this is the best one so far
kept getting messages about loss of memory so i had to get rid of the game the next day -- i 've tried other games before and never had that problem about memory .
very good app and the best 2 dollars you can buy . works great on the kf hd . seriously handy application .
not what i hoped it would be not enough news on it at any one time i will have my husband change it .
this game is really bad ! warning : do not get ! minecraft is way better than this trash . this game is poop .
it 's worth the money . i know it 's $ 1.99 , but i think anyone would love it ! great for any age !
i bet this game works cuz i had a candy apple game like this so it 's probably gon na work so good luck to me !
it is just pictures you can find in a design magazine . the 5 star reviews are clearly fake . i am uninstalling as soon as i finish this review .
easy pass the time game that we all need to have ! anyone can play it and it is a fun game .
really like the recipe section and the grocery section , but ca n't get things to work . ca n't sign in to web . ca n't get full recipes . could n't upgrade .
you can play different modes from relaxing to more challenging . i really enjoyed this game . it 's also very relaxing . well worth the spare change it costs .
this is an addictive game and fun for whoever plays this game . i know whoever plays will have fun playing it .
it kept jumping all over and did not run right .i did not like it at all i found it not fun at all .
its ok but it is really expensive . and it is not worth it . i would n't recommend unless you got it as the free app of the day like i did .
this game is fun and addicting ! even my 5 year old grandson loves it . it takes some skill , but is not too difficult . awesome !
fun game , very challenging . it keeps me busy . passes the time when waiting for appointments , etc . different levels keep it from being boring .
this is a lot of fun to use while training your brain to hold memory . i recommend this product for all who needs memory !
i did not like this game at all . all you do is feed your baby . i do not recommend this game .
this game is great because it is a good game to past time with . if you 're bored you can play bingo and win coins and stuff .
this game is so awesome i ca n't stop playing it is also adicting but still very fun and i 'm glad that the people made this it is so awesome
i know that my husband has enjoyed playing this game alot . he never plays games but i noticed that this one game that he plays so it must be alot of fun . glad he enjoys it
omg ! i have been playing this app for a couple of years now on my different devices and i love it ! definitely get this app if u do n't already have it !
this game was surprisingly really fun ! if you like challenging games and like to think this game ia for you !
worth the download on the kindle fire . this game is fun and very addicting . if i did not download the cheat version along with the game i would still be on the first floor .
did not know what kind of game this was when purchased . my great granddaughter likes this kind of game to play
if you like to enhance your thought process . then this game is for you . you can play with friends or meet other people .
i enjoy this game very much . i play it every day . i have not had any problems at all . i would recommend this to everyone .
ads are n't too bad . that quick finger note is not very accurate but works well . nice quick finger note . short learning curve - but you need to test .
very good game to pass the time away . only has 3 hands but that is because its free . you get the hang of it .
i would recommend it to friends i really like this game . it 's a little fast paced . but i enjoy it . very fun and entertaining .
my daughter and i have fun playing this game together , great way for us to work together . we 've only been stumped twice .
this is a pretty cool app . do n't take it too seriously , it takes some practice . it will probably be awhile before i use it for anything but fun .
sync my pictures on my computer phone and kindle ! yay it even works on my kindle offline . great app thanks !
nice photos , stock but clear . lots of helps without spending too much coin . fun little game . kids would enjoy too .
lots of puzzles in this one and i like being able to shuffle the tiles when i want to instead of waiting until i 'm in a jam . this one is a keeper !
it is cute and limited in selection , but if more people would use it , i 'm sure it would take off .
fun engaging game ! i did n't realize how many restaurants there were and those i actually know . worth the download and it 's free .
not crazy about this app i deleted it . the graphics were n't good and you can only play it for a while i really would not recommend this to anyone who likes these types of games .
i like this game . it can be a challenge but it is fairly basic and keeps my brain working . it is a time filler .
it 's okay , but not as enjoyable as many of the other hidden objects games i have played . may think differently after i play it a little more often .
this freezes all the time it use to be great but now it sucks bad i reccomend not downloading this app
this is great for me and my nine year old . we take the time to play together . when we have a challenge we take a break and go back to pic .
this game gives your brain a work out and it really make you think . some are really easy but other take a while to figure out . lots of fun .

this app is a good choice for my needs in word search . i like the word selections and variety of the game
i should have just kept what i had and not upgraded . it would n't even load my emails after a half hour of waiting ! so frustrated ! !
its a very fun game and a great way to waste time . not all that difficult but still fun to mess with .
not sure how it works because i did n't get a chance to use this yet . i 'm sure it will work fine .
it 's good for what it is . great way to kill some time and you do n't need to be online to play which is great when you have a device that needs a wifi connection .
this game is really fun . i. enjoy it . i would recommend this game to everyone and i suggest you to get it .
nice to have to think and use reason . tired of games that do n't challenge me . ca n't put it down . great game .

this app is so awesome . i am a master at this game . i love this game so much . this game is the most awesome game in the whole universe
love it ... this is a fun game that will make your mind work : ) i like playing it with my daughter : )
i 'm giving it four stars before playing just because of the app description . yes , i 've played games just like this in the past , but the developer made it sound fresh and exciting : - )
game for like a 2 yr old . this was super boring and idk why i even downloaded it to try it
my grandchildren love it . the & # 34 ; frozen characters & # 34 ; are fun to interact with and the games are challenging enough to keep the kids occupied for hours .
i enjoy all of the angry bird games , they help me wind down after work and dinner , and at my age this is good .
i love it . i really does work . i sleep much better after using the tablet before bed . i am so glad i found it .
this is the best sports app on android . works great and has a widget that you can customize . highly recommend for scores and stats . also has closing betting odds . great app .
have not used this as much as i would like to but i really like this app . i have recommended it to all my friends and family .
this game is not for me or for children it 's to bloody . i like happy things & games that make sense . you do n't have kill something to have fun .
having a lot of fun playing these games . i can 't wait to unlock more . posting this review to get more points like everybody else .

i so enjoy watching history documents i am very ill and it helps me get interesting things to learn not stupid television and so many adds .
i thought i would like this app , but it was not what i thought it was . i have removed this app from my device .
it 's like temple run but with a twist and it makes u want to try again and again it 's cool
fun to play . ads are n't a big deal and no real pressure to buy extras just so you can complete a level .
i enjoy the fact you can play of line and on graphics are great ... . no issues with crashing on my kindle hours of fun
this game is lots of fun . love building my own village . and it 's free . what else can u ask for .
i like the game but i think you should give more credits to play the game when you sign on to play .
lots of fun to play . coming up with correct words with the given letters is n't always easy . makes me think !
it is okay , need to add different games to it , the ones on there are okay but not great . still had fun but you are limited one day play , recommend it slightly
the game was too easy to complete which made it boring after a while . but besides that ir was a fun game
this the most fun game i ever played on a tablet ! most apps are make for a touch screen but not this one , it feels like a game for a console ! awesomeness
my 3 yr old daughter is a master of this game , and my 5 yr old likes the harder grid .
enjoyed playing against machine rather than on web i can stop playing at any time that i need to stop
i do n't like the fact that you have to buy new things to go on with the game . so no
love the game.the mini games are really fun to play and u seem to get slot of them . if u love slots give this on a try . u will not regret it
i love love love love this game i play it with my mom and she always beats me with the older songs .

is a fun game . was going good until my kindle lost all data . now starting over . would not waste the time with other games .
never freezes . adds only pop up with each new deal . plenty of ways to change the settings to match your preferred style of play .
i love this site . i am on it all the time getting recipes and ideas . great for the holiday ideas .
i just could not put in down ! ! ! ! i thought maybe i would just play for a few minutes , the minutes turned to a couple hours .
this book is very informative but i have seen much better . i would still recommend to a friend friend to keep on pc .
i thank it a great arcade game i love arcade games a lot of games to choose from and you will never get tired of one particular game because their are a variety of games to choose from .

i love playing . i have gotten to play with family that lives far away or old friends i have n't seen i 'm forever !
worst app out there you ca n't even go to the other levels unless you spend money so do n't waste your time they say it 's free but then make you pay if you want to continue
fun game , but as soon as i 'm about to win the level the screen goes black . playing on the kindle fire .
this game is a lot of fun and a fun time to allow time to go by . i will sit down and play it and the next thing i know hours have passed
so it kinds fun but not what i was thinking my friends said oh its adicting you 'll love it well i do n't
did n't care for it . takes too long to download . might have been a cool game if we could have played it .
my daughters got me interested in this game and even though my fashion sense is not that great , i 've decided i love this game !
i play lots but it have short puzzle time . it should be more puzzles but limit . please make more puzzles because i love them lots .
this is an ok puzzle game . nothing too exciting , not much of a variety . kills time ... i would think there are better ones out there .
i have player plenty of games . the bonuses are smaller than other games but the wins are more and it is funner than other games .
this game was really enjoyable . i loved figuring out how to save the green boxes . however , there were only a few levels in the version i got .
i love this app because of the wide variety of comics and the ability to take my comics on the go .
not as good as the old & # 34 ; game boy & # 34 ; version of many years ago .
i love this game ! highly recommended ! ! ! many hours of mindless fun when i needed it . buy it ! ! you wo n't regret it .
fun . free . i am a bongo junkie so i enjoy playing on the go with my kindle fire and i also play at home on my computer .
would love to use it but do not want to join yahoo to use it . was not aware i would have to do that .
awesome game very addicting and fun . the mini games are great and entertaining . almost like diner dash but with zombies lol
mostly good . really not bad . just kinda okay . works to kill time . decent distraction . like it enough to keep it on my phone . basically not junk .
it works just like it is supposed to . it is easy to use and gives me the information i need .
both grandsons ages 5 and 13 love this game especially the 13 year old . once he starts playing he laughs i have to make him put it down .
love this app . only problem is i wish my child could adjust volume and screen brightness on her own . it is a pain to have to adjust the volume myself multiple times during a game .
this is alright . it 's kinda boring . i have n't played it in a while , but it 's ok. it was free so that the good thing !
game is very fun and it gets harder as you get further with each shark . you upgrade to different sharks the longer you play . recommend for anyone wanting to play a simple fun game .
we all enjoy this game . 2 year old great grandson loves it , grand kids love it and i enjoy playing . it 's a game for everyone .
awesome game i love it so much although i 'm just ten it is a fun game new for kids my age .
does make u think . not addicting but makes you really think of combinations of words . the only th ok by is it does n't let you skip . the hints are worth coins .
great game held my interest all the way through the game . lots of fun looking for all the hidden objects . there are a lot you really need to look all over the different scenes .
i love that you can challenge other people . this is just like scrabble , only this one you can play world wide !

it runs perfectly on the kindle fire . i have always been a tetris fan . i find this to be a fun game . runs smoothly .
i prefer a game like the lost city compared to this . this is an ok game but i wouldnt have bought it if i knew what it was about . it didnt really challange me .

i bought it today that its free i love it i would of payed for it . its just like the board game . it works great on my kindle fire .
i am loving this game . i play a lot of the hidden object games . this one has been a lot of fun . i recommend this game completely .
this is a very entertaining app . it is easy to use , and offers a great deal of information . i recommend this app to others .
when coloring the pictures you tap a part of the picture then the whole pic turns that color . not many colors to choose from . and should have some better pictures to color .
installed this thinking it 'd be lots of fun . instead , i do n't think it lasted 3 days before i uninstalled it . just plain boring .
these are short little games , but at least there is a lot of variety . i like having to play them in order to unlock more .
i really like this game . it took me a while to get used to how to play but now i enjoy it very much .
i love this app . could be improved by being able to choose background colors and drawing types and colors . otherwise it would be a 5 star app
a nice little app if you do n't have texting on your phone ... or you wish to use another device .
i played it on my computer and of course , the cards were larger and easier to see on the computer .
the fun factor goes away in an hour .you can set the gun to fire for an alarm or notification 's that 's probably the best thing about the application .
i enjoy this quick read and thought for the day . a good pick me up for the upcoming day and something i miss if i do n't read it everyday .
all the apps stay open and burn battery life on my tablet until i power off , with this app i close them when i 'm done with them . great app for free .
i live the games that i can play on the go . this is one that at home i play online and on the go on my kindle fire hd .
this is so much fun . great game to unwind from a stressful day . i would recommend to all ages to play this game .
i 'm pleased so far with this game ( level 4 ) . it combines town building , strategy and turn based battle . i have n't had to spend any money yet !
i use it for everything ! i am a teacher and i use it for grades . it 's great and i use it all the time .
i dont know why people r giving this game bad reviews ... i love it ... . great picture and amazing on kindle and i pad ! 5 stars !
its fun and mostly a challenge . some times share it with family so be get a bit competitive . but its fun to do especially when you are just sitting for a long period of time .
great app . i have this installed on my kindle device . i have n't used it much yet , but seems to be a very handy app to have .
this game is awesome . nothing like good clean fun for my grand-daughter . this game would keep her entertained for hours , if i let her play that long . thank you , for such an entertaining game
it is a very fun game to play . i play it all the time . i really love love this game .
i downloaded this game today . i did n't have any problems with ads . i also have n't had any issues running on the fire so far .
it 's classic zuma , there is n't much else to say . there are ads , but what do you expect when it 's free ?
my son liked this at first but then he lost interest . i ended up deleting it and finding him something else .
it 's something to do to fill the time . nothing special about it . it 's easier to win than spider solitaire , which makes it more boring .
perfect game for on the go parents with kids who love puzzles as much as mine . even i get into the puzzles
love this game ! i am getting higher in the levels and i get more coins that way . love that ! it is a great time passer .
this app works great on my kindle , do n't see any difference between this and yahoo ? mail on my laptop . it is easy to access folders to store message in .
this app was so much fun . it takes a lot of strategy to solve the puzzles quickly and collect all the ducks . i just finished the whole game and am waiting 4 the next installment .
i like the app on my phone , but the kindle fire version seems to freeze up a lot . i quit using this and started using reddit is fun .
this game is fun and the backgrounds are so very beautiful and relaxing . it works well on my kindle fire .
i love this game ! i could play this game all day long and not get tired of it . i would recommend this game to anyone who likes playing games that involve dice !
i find this so easy to use . it 's a favorite to catch up watching tv shows on the kindle . ads are short and to the point .
love having the ability to get free books for my kf . it makes traveling so much more enjoyable . i highly recommend trying it .
warning -- once you start playing this game , you are hooked . it is a great game , i can totally lose track of time playing it !
i even got an e-mail about the update but cant update on my kindle fire ! i would play this game alot more if i could get the update ! where is the kindle fire update people ! ! !
this was a fun game . i played it on a kindle fire and it worked great . the story line was kind of silly but that was part of the charm .
overall good app . great way to kill the time . would be perfect if you could pass and play and play other opponents over the network .
this game will really test your memory skills . some of the items have n't been seen for some time but you won ` t have too much trouble remembering them . , it is fun .
so far i am loving this game . i can choose which way my character goes , be good or bad . also fun for teens .
too many ads & amp ; runs poorly on my android phone . dont bother downloading this poorly made app . not worth it , even when free
the puzzles are very beautiful . fun to do . it would be helpful if the board did not move as you were trying to do the puzzle would reccomend this puzzle to others
this game is like the other ones you just need to think what all pictures have in common some are kind of tricky .
my son loves this game . does n't matter if he plays by himself or if i help him , he loves it .
this app is so much fun . there are few things that the original uno does not have . i highly recommend getting this app . you should get this app .
my granddaughter loves this along with the tons of other kindle aps she has .
i do n't know what i expected but this was not it . i found the voice to aggravating and not soothing . i just was not impressed .
it makes it easier to get on the amazon site through my tablet . seems to work ok , but have n't used it much as of yet .
i love this app . very useful and convenient , fun and does the job without a lot of fuss . good deal for the price .
its ok i dont always like it alot so you should get it for younger kids to play with it
i clicked on this by mistake and did n't want the game on my kindle . no more words to describe it
this is a great riddle game for those who love a challenge . it 's good exercise for your brain . what are you waiting for , get the app and start thinking ! ! !
love all the angry birds games . they certainly are challenging but oh so much fun . great games ! would recommend these games for anyone .
the game is awesome i just with we could have friends and add people to our friend list so later on if they are online we can invite them to a game
a friend was playing this and go me hooked ! sometimes the word does n't seem right for all the pics , but that just makes your brain work harder .
i enjoyed it when l played for awhile , but it kept giving me the same things to find . i would recommend this for children and it would be something to keep them occupied .
i can watch youtube on my kindle fire with . this browser . so cool ! ! so glad i found this one . i highly recommend it
i actually did n't use this after all as i was not prepared to enter all my recipes . might be good for someone who wants to go to that sort of trouble .
it 's cute to play with but lose interest would n't really recommend it to anyone kind of boring not that fun
so far so good . it appears that this is going to another interesting game . i must say so far the games that i 've chosen from this particular creator or creators have been enjoyable and fascinating .
i like this because you do n't keep playing the same game over and over . ever time i play they are different . sometimes i get them all and sometimes i do n't . i like a challenge .
essential to have on my kindle fire ; practical and handy . glad i have it on my kindle fire - it helps to have it .
i enjoy playing this game and enjoy playing with people that do n't have word cheat apps to help them out .
i enjoyed playing this game . it is addicting and when others watch you they want to play this game also . it is a must have game .
i love this game if i could make one change it would but more stuff to make at less time i thing some of the times are to long
candy crush is amazing . it is one of my favorite games ! i would highly recommend this to people who like problem solving games !
the game was nothing that i expected to be . you really do not crush the words but have to find them like find a word puzzles .
this game was great ! been a little while since i enjoyed a big fish game this much ! from the sound of the reviews people are really enjoying it ! keep games like this coming big fish !
i love this game , it is a lot of fun to play . awesome game . my family enjoys playing the game to .
it is ok i think it could take less time to install all it does is quiz you like i expected it to .
i have this game on my computer and like it but did not get the opportunity to buy it on my kindle .
i love this game so much i have it on my kindle and my phone ! thank you for creating this game ... i 'm addicted !
i got mahjong on my kindle because i seem to be waiting a lot in different places . i love to read but their are places a quick game fits the bill better .
i use all the time to keep updated . i use the weather more than weather channel . would download to my phone too
this is a really fun game . not as easy as it looks as you get farther into it . i like the different twist on it . i play it many times a day .
this game is so much fun ! i love being able to play with her whenever i want . it 's so relaxing : d i will highly recommend !
fun to play and makes me think ! i like that there are levels and they get harder . glad an app such as this one was created . passes the time for sure !
i just started playing this game and have found it interesting and fun . nice way to spend some free time
this is an interesting puzzle game . i enjoy the challenge . not much more to say about it , bit i do not have enough words to submit .
fun and mildly entertaining , simple to start with and then progressively more challenging . good for those interested in crossword puzzles , scrabble , and similar word games .
i upgraded to hd so i did n't have to put up with the ads since i absolutely love this game !
i enjoy playing this game . it makes you think about the answer and can be challenging at times . good way to kill time .
i was not interested in this type of art . it was hard to manipulate . just not for me . not bad concept .
this app did n't quite live up to how it was described . it is definitely for someone who wants to keep an electronic diary .
one reason i love this app is because it is a brain teaser for everyone and even little tiny kids .
it was fun for awhile . but then it just became repetitive . but it was good for awhile and i 'd load it it again .
the graphics are pretty real . i like that you are in control of what happens , makes the game more strategic . i recommend the game it 's fun and addicting .
i downloaded this app for my daughter and she ca n't stop talking about it . great app and i hope she gets something out of it .
fast paced and easy to do . can put down and pick right back up . enjoy this game as much as candy crush .
6 pieces does not a puzzle make . at least , for adults . and only one puzzle . who sets up these games ? i deleted this one .
this game is really fun i like how u have to unlock different games . and to get certain games you have to get a certain score . and i like the challenge .
every one make a rate on this i love this game if u love or like put 5 stars please
.you have hours of fun playing this game . ca n't stop playing it at all love , love , love this game . you will too .
this is a very fun and addictive game . i highly recommend it . it plays well on my kindle fire . love it
i really enjoy this game . i have n't played all the modes , but adventure mode is fun , but makes you think and plan .
nice game fun to play . good time killer . easy for kids and adults to play . god way to relax the body but stretch the mind .
scary as hell but i like the title music i put head phones on so i can hear better and get a good experience of slender man
fun game overall , though it got difficult faster than it should ... it is still a very fun puzzle game . four stars , definitely .
i like this app . the graphics & amp ; layout is easy to navigate . keep improving . download , its worth it . enjoy & amp ; happy watching .
i love it it is great for kids . any . age if u rate . u get a free hint even if u rate it on facebook and its not hard or easy
it is a very app and seeing that i love horses , i love this app so much . the horses are nice to take care of .
i thought it was something else , i made a mistake and i wish i could get rid of it real bad .
played for a little bit then got off and now it wo n't open . plus it wo n't log into facebook . fix and i 'll give s better review .
i did do a fortune and you have to pick three things ( it does random things first ) and i could n't see the third thing so if i were you i would not get this stupid app
its a nice game to waste some time on but your going to get bored and uninstall . not the best game to install
pretty much the same as all other match 3 puzzels , but it will pass the time of day for entertainment
very good game . is addicting the only thing is the waiting to get grabs . recommend it to help pass time .
not enough side games . it gets boring after a while . good graphics . has good potential to be better and more competitive .
if you like word puzzles you will spend hours playing this game . the graphics are not exactly & quot ; stunning & quot ; but it 's not really necessary when playing this type of game .
very good ! i like it because it stimulates your brain . helps you to interact with your friends and others playing this game .
it lets you connect and use your netflix account to watch the movies and shows you want . no issues found .
habit forming , makes you think . some of the clues are really hard to figure out which can make the game very frustrating .
a whole lot of fun ! easy to play and addicting as well ! a must play for the whole family ! i definitely recommend this game .
i said it is not good because you have to buy all the room and you just play with one do n't get
i do n't care i love it this app is great it 's nice that they have free apps that are n't crappy
this game is really fun . it is somewhat like cartoon wars except u can be someone , so its better . i definately reccomend this app to everybody .
this is a fun game . i highly recommend it as a way to help keep your mind sharp . challenging fun for the whole family .
so far the game is really easy . the graphics are just ok. i do n't like the fact you have to pay for levels , but i enjoy the game so i 'll continue playing .
i have played a game that is similar to this one . out of both games this one is the best . thank you very much .
deleted , never figured out how to play , no instructions , i must be too old or stupid , deleted it from my kindle
very great game for kids . it 's enjoyable and awesome . i would get this game because it 's very fun . hey this g game
this should be called a trial ! you 're not getting a free game , you 're getting a trial of the real game . i like the game , but the description is misleading .
good game a little short need the next chapter soon . want to know what happens . the waiting is killing me
nice game . great graphics . soothing background music and good story line . plus its free ! what could be better than free ?
no good for nothing . useless , just another useless application . i & apos ; m glad people do reviews like android tells you read reviews to avoid useless apps like this one .
was not sure about this game . fun but froze up several time . i had to download this twice . after it was great . finding items , and trying to figure the mystery was great .
even as a free game this was so boring , and it froze all the time . i got it thinking it would be something funny to let my husband play , but it was n't . i deleted .
it was difficult to figure out and maneuver , not as much fun as thought it would be . not as expected .
neat app but it is only interesting the first time you view it . kind of a waste of technical genius .
fun game to play to waste time . the controls are a little hard to get use to at first but after awhile it gets easier
seems to work fine . i ugly have not had any issues . i do not plan to use it that much .
this so far is the best dozer game i 've played but why do the coins max out ? i think you should be able to collect as much as you want .
excellent source for time zone reference and travel planning . i have loaded my areas of interest and can reference times at any time of the day .
the game was slow and easy at first then harder . only 10 levels for free then you have to pay for each level . that kind of stinks .
i like this game and so does my son . i would highly recommend this app to anyone who has a android phone . my wife loves this as well .
the game is okay . plays pretty well on kindle fire hd . i don ' t like that you have to purchase coins to continue to play .
this game is so fun to play and it it really addictive . i just can not stop playing this game . i think that it is way better then the first one i played . love this game .
this is the only weather app i use and trust . it 's very reliable . great app with great nice new features .
fun , entertaining , different types of slots . the best part about this is that you are almost always a winner . it 's fun and entertaining at the same time .
i really enjoyed the game . i 'm still having fun with it today . i enjoyed it so much that i ordered the pc version .
this was a free app that will keep you busy . it is not always my go to app but for being free i am glad i downloaded it although i do n't use it that often .
i 'm a dog lover , so this puts a smile on my face when i show this off to others . all thinks it is special .
great game to pass among friends and family , terrific way to bring family together . played with my 7 year old nephew , great fun !
this is a really great app . i learned how to draw many things from this app . i love this app .
i am not very good at this game but i really like a challenge when playing a game , sometimes there are two of us guessing until we solve it .
after first use crashes every time i open it . thought it would be a fun interesting app which it would be if it worked like its supposed to
this app does n't have the kind of photos i wanted to use as wallpapers , etc . it is okay though just not what i wanted .
i think this would be a great game except that it keeps freezing up and stops working in the middle of the game . and because it does i am not keeping it .
this game is as fun to play as cut the rope . it 's fun to play when you want to something and you do n't want to spend any money .
ok. my friends are obsessed with this app so of course i had to get it . its a cool app and is easy to use .
this game is great . very tough competition . only complaint is that when racing online , the standard and the pro version races for the same levels ca n't race each other .
i like it . and it 's fun . and the levels are interesting . i like the character design . and it 's entertaining . it 's worth getting .
it is just like angry birds but you only get the black bird that blows up . it gets boring fast .

a super fun game . after a while it gets a little to complicated for this older player . it has 3 levels but even easy gets hard .
my personal opinion of this game is that it is boring . however i am not a big fan of this type of game .
i use this app to find books for myself and my granddaughter who is 3. i never fail to find something good for us both .
great range - free - variety - free - continuously challenging - free - stimulating and free ! i love it .
i like that you are n't playing against a hundred people so you actually have a chance at getting bingo . also has a lot of extras that keep the game exciting .

i have had temple run many times before on other devices , but it works best on kindle fires ! great game , no ads , pretty good !
this game as a great story line . well worth the money . big fish as done it again ! i love all big fish games .
keeps you on your toes , have to find and create items to find clues to open the next stage not boring .
it has alot of pictures and funny things to send people . i would recommend it to adults and there kids .
very fun . like the interaction with the little people . good for wasting time . if you like building your own world games this is a must .
this is a pretty good game ! the graphics are good for a free app . the kids and i really enjoy it .
if you enjoy tetris usually this is a good app for the kindle fire . it is pretty similar to the regular games we used to always play . i never had any problems with it at all .
great way to waste your time , play the machine or play an opponent . i just do n't believe every roll is random and that i am always playing a real live opponent some place .
my favorite alarm clock app . i & apos ; m really happy that it & apos ; s the free app of the day ; i was planning on buying it anyway and i just saved some cash !

so soothing and relaxing no glitches or anything it is so cool and so r the options of the noises
i absolutely love this app . it works amazingly well doing what i need it to do . it is number helpful . one of the best simple apps i have gotten .
when i pick this up , i ca n't put it down . it 's awesome . i ca n't wait to get more . ready to try the hard level .
its a great game on the kindlefire . its very fun and runs smooth . it can also be very addictive and pass the time quickly .
i think its a wonderful game that has incredible graphics and has a level of difficulty . i think its suitable for any age .
useful but not as clean master . a very basic app , can be used but not very appealing . give you just little more control .
this is a amazing game it works great on my android tablet and is sooooooo much fun , you should get this app
i really thought this game was going to be really bad . the only reason i got it was to compete with my sister , but in the end it turned out to be a great game .
excellent story line , with good graphics . game occupied you for a long time with great clues that keep you on the right path and very involved . one of the best games i have played .
the games are simple but lots of fun . when you hit a great hit you get so excited . i would recommended it .
at first i thought this game was too easy but it really gets challenging as you continue to play . it is fun and causes you to think . great game if you like word games .
graphics are great . really makes u think . needs more levels and hints for when you are really stuck ! great app .
this is a great game for passing some time or if you are a fan of shooters . controls are responsive and simple to learn .

this game is so fun but i hate when your prizes you are about to get fall off the edge but this game is so much fun
love it 's awesome : ) runs smooth with no problems . used a one before this one & liked it but not as much as this one . ended up uninstall it & installing this one .
its a bad app . it does n't even do anything whatsoever . i do not recommend wasting even a second thought on this app .
if you loves super mario bros , you will surely love this game ! awesome game . i feel 8 yrs old again . ( i 'm in my 30 's )
this games is a gear game . it looks like it is made for kids but adults will like it too it as many different levels with new tricks to make it a different challenge .
i did not like the selection . it seems to be completely free though . just not the right app for me i suppose . i was hoping for something more .
so realistic just wish it had more to do when beginning kind of boring and it would be better if you could make money and gems easier ! ! !
this game gets your mind thinking about the pictures and the answer . you have to play it for yourself to see .
great for kids and adults specially if you have a bingo addiction . love how you do n't have to wait all day for more coins like other bingo apps .
a must for any yahoo fantasy football addict ! quality beats iphone and droid phone , second only to the website itself
fun game . i think it is a good way to test the brain a little bit having it a timed game .
this is a fun story and it reads the book to your child . my 4 yr old loves it and has read it more times than i can count .
not the best game in the world . it does pass time when you are bord though . i would not recommend getting it .
this game is not easy once you make it past the first few levels . yet it is pretty addictive and plays great on the phone as well as the kindle or other tablets .
i 've been playing pogo games for several years . i was pleased i could get it for my kindle . i do n't have to have my computer with me anymore to play . very pleased
i like this app i just wish we had more to choose from and that all the books were free .
have this on my phone , so i put it on the fire for the heck of it . far easier to use on the kindle fire with the larger touch screen .
fun to play . wish i could keep going , but i wish there was a way to undo a match instead of just switching what you match it with
i had no idea how great candy crush saga looks ! the app store made it convenient to install and i am enjoying my game play more than ever .
somewhat interesting but very similar to family farm which is much better and engaging .
i really like this game . it makes u think about the shows we watch to think of the scenes . great job

i just ca n't put this game down ! it 's really fun and original . the only minor complaint i have is there is no music , but that 's fine .
this magazine app looked very interesting . it 's not . if you want full access you have to pay , and it 's not cheap !
when i tried this app i thought it was really accurate to my mood and it was kinds cool . that id why i 'm giving it 4 stars .
not bad . the controls are decent on my droid x. the game wo n't blow your mind , but it 's worth a dollar for a little time killing here and there .
addictive gameplay . cute graphics . this ones a classic that never goes out of style . cant wait for grandson to get a bit older so he can play
easy to use for study projects . it is accurate and easy to maneuver . like to be able to access at any time .

deleted this because i could n't get the pieces to rotate ... ... there are much better puzzle apps out there so keep looking !

its pretty fun ... it gives me something to do to pass the time . gets addicting trying to keep on getting the high score .
good game . gives out points pretty easy . like the rest of the games . has a weekly challenge that gives you points to enter drawings with . bingo is my favorite though .
i would give this game five stars but , sometimes the screen turns all blue and i cant see what i 'm doing its really annoying .
i have only played for about 5 minutes so far , but so far it seems like a great game . fun , challenging but not too hard . i think i will enjoy this game .

i put this on my kindle so my grandkids could play and keep them busy . they love it so does grandma
i liked this because it was simple and not a lot of rules , but yet entertaining and makes you have to think a little once the levels go higher ,
this is a game that i got really board with . i found that there was really nothing to do , or any kind of challenge for me .
it was really fun but one time it updated and deleted all my money , stuff , and i had another granny : ( i would still say it 's pretty fun.i would give it a 4
i use this when im travelling and it work very well for me . i also use it at home so i do n't change my work alarm clock .
this game is so addicting i can play this all day . this is the funnest game that i have ever played on my kindle fire .
well i do watch it live on tv daily but the app is useless to me its not updated and shows old news from weeks or several days old ... .not for me i guess .
it 's easy for my grandkids to pick up the skills needed to play this game . good for quiet time or rainy days .
nothing is better at the end of a crazy day than being able to pin on my fire ! good app and easy to use !
loved playing this beautifully built hidden object game . has lots of puzzles to keep you busy . i would love more games like this .
i usually scroll through the top 100 free but this made it so much easier and it lets you know when there 's a limited time freebie which is awesome ! must get this .
the game is ok. not too challenging , according to my grandson , but i can not keep the load on long enough .
i do n't know if i will like this one or not . i 'm currently using a couple of their other ones first .

when i first seen i thought was just a copy cat but you actually take care of the cat . it is amazing ...
i first saw this game during last week on my friends ipod it was awesome and its one of the best types of games ever it is worth your time for sure : ) : )
this would be a great game if it would load faster , but it takes a very long time to load . sometimes you just want to play nor wait forever to load .

i use this on a kindle fire . it is great ! the display is very adequate for the size of the screen .
so far i 'm loving this game . i can see that it is a game that can occupy a lot of time and that can be a good thing or a bad thing !
this game is fairly simple for adults , but would be great for young kids . too bad there are few games like this for adults .
this was a very good game , my grand sons play this game all the time , it keeps them busy on the kindle
it is great . on a kindle fire and a ipad . disney made a super great game . everyone should play this game !

nothing but the temperature . well it was free so no loss . already deleted it . i can watch the weather channel .
having a yes these games before i had already known that you would end up paying to play the whole game .
this is a challenging game . the graphics are very detailed . the min games are challenging . i would recommend this game .
i could n't get this to work , but i 'm sure that 's not a fault of the app , probably just my not understanding how to work it .
awful . it is another very time wasting and pointless game . i strongly recommend that you do not buy it . it is just awful once again .
always played yahtzee back when , so this is very easy to learn & plan strategies , nice job . adults and kids will enjoy this .

great way to catch up on international news . now i need twelve more words before i can post this comment .
i love this game but the only problem that i have is that you can not play a full game you have to buy why so sad but over all good game ... .
i did n't care for this app because i could n't find many episodes . the shows were mostly just clips . some of the other channel apps have full episodes of their best shows .
i personally did n't really the game , but it is so addicting . as much as i did n't really like it i could n't put it down ! so , i give it 4 stars .
some answers come easy , giving you a place to start with the more difficult clues . a good balance and good fun too .
this is the first time i have installed an app that just wo n't play . it actually loaded once i tapped play and then it was gone . so i will be removing it .
good game , but gets hard sure you have to get new units but you can get more money by playing online .
at first the game is almost too easy but as you progress through the levels it becomes quite challenging . fun to play with a group or just to pass time .
had it on my phone & was hoping to get on my kindles . yes ! very adicting ! ! sometimes hard to get to next levels .
it was a very fun game , i really think people will like it and should be willing to only spend there time to download and play this game .
i lost my tablet to my wife because she 's always now using it for playing this game . should n't have told her how to get to the amazon store
did not work on samsung galaxy s3 . installed and reinstalled several times trying different downloads and settings . if i try again i will note it here .
same as above , i can not afford to spend money on these games to get to a further level , sorry about that .

this game is fun and challenging . runs great on the kindle fire . i would recommend to anyone who likes word games .
would new recommend this . it is a little confusing . may just not be the kind of challenge that i like .
great game . kind of quirky with the country scenes and the music but it is another great hidden object game .
my 5 year old loves all these dress up type apps . she never seems to get bored of them . simple app to use .
very good game easy to play keeps you interested and wanting to come back for more not hard to play easy to figure out
this app is totally worth the money and it is a great time waster . i love it ! anyone who is considering getting it really should .
this app constantly locks up during the advertisements . i have to go to the abc website on my pc to watch the programs . this has happened on 5 different shows . very frustrating !
i do n't have a lot to say about this game . it bored me . it might be very entertaining to some people who have a lot of patience but that 's not me .
i love this game as do my kids and husband ! we have it on every device in our house ! lol
better payouts ! better graphics ! better game ! more fun all around ! and free is always better ; ) highly recommended for all slots players !
i love this app it is my favorite app ever ! i think people should stop complaining about the ads . ads do n't matter when your having fun !
not too hard . not too easy . this game has just the right combination of fun and thinking ! please add more levels soon !
this is another mahjong that really enjoy . anyone would really like to play this . i have to concentrate on hat # 's . good for anyone and any age .
there were not many options for clothes , the game was just terrible ! there was no quality or time put into this game ! not worth your time !
very good game . keeps you occupied for hours . easy to use . this game is a lot of fun and i highly recommend it !
total logic fun ! especially love the 15 x 15 - what a challenge ! liked it so much i got another flippix art - zoo
i love it ! ! ! ! ! it 's awesome ! i was looking in the recommended apps for me and here it was . you need to down load now ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
i love how this plays better on my kindle fire than on my computer . thank you for the free app !
this is a cool game for anyone who likes bingo it is a fun and relaxing game that you can play
it seems to have a lot hidden object puzzles . i guess i need to just buy the game in order to give an accurate review .
i was not impressed with this app despite the fact i love hidden object games . would not recommend this app
this game is pretty cool . different from most match games but i like it . requires a little strategy which brings out the challenge in me to keep on playing .
i think you have to buy additional lives on this . might be good as a group game . i do n't have much to say about this .
i enjoy playing g this game because it lets me be a horse owner while not actually own a horse
not worth your trouble . unless you are 5 and then it might hold attention for two or three minutes . sorry .
the game just does n't work all of the time , it freezes a lot and sometimes you ca n't even open it .
kept me occupied a lot longer than most games of the same genre , liked all the different types of puzzles in it .
this app is great to use because you can easily learn to play a guitar when you have no idea how . i recommend you to get this app . it 's also free ! !
i love this flash light i am up a lot at night and its better then turning on lights in the house
like this game , just wish ya did not have to wait so long for chips . and can only purchase with real money .
fun game to kill time . wish it was not so expensive and i would love to buy it . hoping to get more free coins so i can buy it
a lot of fun , great way to pass the time . some puzzles can be difficult to solve , but with each puzzle you learn more to help solve the other puzzles .
enjoyable fun lots of levels to master free coin every 4 hours lots of free coins on facebook friends can send free coins friends can also send free spins
why ? what is the point of this ? it dose not even make noise ! ! ! just save yourself the storage space on your device and pass on this one .
an ok hidden object app not as good as some though . i have so many that i dont play this one as much as others .
i am addicted and ca n't wait to get the next game . these games are so fun and actually unwind me .
fun game , like a lot of bubble shoot games . it 's slow sometimes which causes multiple shots which is not good . no instructions , which is a hassle
i do n't play to many games on my cell but i love this game ! ! the biggest problem is that its too darn addictive , i ca n't put it down once i start ! ! ! !
i only have two words to say about this app ... does n't open . it looked like it might be fun if it would open .
the levels need to give you little hints about how to get out because i get stuck a lot . the game is good for something that is free .
i really like this logo game . they are a different look for pics . i like the icon look . it has multiple levels also .
i got the games for my friends children when they come over this game is like by them all . would recommend it after watching them play the game .
it 's not worth a dollar . questions seem like poor translations from another language . wish i could limit questions to shows i actually watch .
me and my grandson and granddaughter like to play this game and he always beats me with a higher score .
i wish i had n't ordered this one . i find myself completely bored with it . i suppose if you are into playing slot machines it would be fun .
adware ! ! if i could i would give it negative stars come on people beware do n't download . with so many bible games out there why this
i really like this game even more so than the others i played . i have learned so many words and the pictures give them meaning .
addicting game that my daughter likes to play . helps with coordination skills and problem solving . would recommend this game to a friend .
the game is great . does anyone know how many levels it has . i can see myself playing it for 100 's of levels .
game plot was good and puzzles were challenging . i would have liked to have more of the picture puzzles where you have to figure out how the picture goes together .
a relaxing game that is not too hard or too easy . it is worth buying . a good way to spend those spare minutes .
do n't have much to say about it . it 's fun and simple of use . i will definitely recommend it . my kid 's loves it .
i enjoy the old style bingo offers , the problem that i have with the game is the time in between the calls . i enjoy a much faster paced game .
a great game on my kindle it fun addicting dosent require wifi to play can get cool cars fun i great recommend getting
i like this game ! but what i dislike it only drops 4 coins instead of 5. and you have to reach level 50 before you can play the other 2 games that come with it .
this is a fun game to kill time with . good graphics . who does n't like shooting things ? i also like the fact there are n't pop up ads .
a very simple to use and very functional application . i decided not to buy a stop watch based on the functionality of this very neat app .
perfect tool for keeping up to date with all of my pinterest activities . thank you so much for this cool app .
i picked this game because i enjoy playing freecell . i do n't always win but it is fun to try to beat the computer .
need more pieces to the puzzles . the puzzles are no more then 20 pieces and not very interesting . i should not complain for a & # 34 ; free game & # 34 ; .
great app so far . will update later . the only problem so far is alarm sound is to low . even when turned up .
the app runs smooth and it does exactly what is advertised . graphics are ok. we 've seen this game many times . there is nothing that makes this one stand out .
i play this on fb almost everyday . you have to use strategy to figure out how to improve your score . love mind games
this game is a fun one to play . the songs are catchy . very enjoyable ! it is a really good free game .
this is a great bingo game ! good pace and lots of action . it has fun prizes too . i like the fact you can win bingo chips to buy more cards . : )
this game really makes you think . it has great graphics and easy use . you wo n't be disappointed with this game .
as above , worth getting for a change of pace . it is find the number you need and press . never changes .
it has work awesome for me love everything about it if you need a bible for your kindle i would say this would be the one for you : )
love these types of games . fun to play . maybe if it was a little faster pace , it would be better .
this game is very fun and addicting . it 's hard to stop playing it . i would recommend this game to anyone .
this game is great way to exercise your mind . all towers are different and create a different challenge . i like that they have daily puzzles to solve .
and i can see it being quite useful for some people . i just spent a few minutes trying it , and surely like it a lot .
perfect for grandsons or your little guy - i downloaded it for that reason will get you both laughing easy to use varied sounds
there were many challenging puzzles and some way too easy . it was fun to play though does not take too long to finish .
this app is a really good but sometimes really inappropriate but other than that it is a good app lol
i like the new game . it is cool that they have new ideas for every holiday . i have found that i am excited everytime i go online to see what new challenges and tasks there will be .
love playing the game but it is difficult to get others to do the second round of the fast money . if not for that , i would had given 5 stars .
i can not get this game to work on my kindle , it comes up but does not work . i may just need to mess with it some more for now it is just setting in the cloud .
i love this game its way harder than i thought lol . ive seen a lot of the logos but just cant seem to name them .
i love hidden object games so i am always looking for new games . this game is fun to play when you are bored
screen was to small to enjoy the game and see all the moves so i have all ready removed it from my kindle
i did not & # 34 ; hate it & # 34 ; just found it too confusing -- have this problem with several apps i download . directions must be somewhere i ca n't find
wide variety of movies , older , newer , cartoon and non . my kids and i really enjoy passing the time with this game !
you can only play one game of each casino unless you want to pay for tokens . the games are boring
i have played this before on the computer , great game . runs smooth on my note 2 , worth the down load
so violent and fun and is the only reason i wake up at 2 in the morning to play it
it was free ... how can someone complain ? i enjoy the game and the graphics are fine . i guess my expectations are not that great but i do n't find much to complain about .
it 's the same as all the other grid games -- match 3 icons and win points . i 'll stick with the old jewel games that i already have loaded .
i love sudoku ! this app is great - it has all the elements of a good sudoku app , including the ability to display hints when necessary .
great app ... perfect for preschool and beyond . fun to play as a single player or with a friend ! i have had no problems with it .
like all those endless running dreams , but with points and bonuses . and sometimes falling off the edge is actually funny .
this game is a great way to waste some time as well as to keep you entertained . i have always loved doing puzzles so this is great for on the go .
what a fun game ! build up & quot ; money & quot ; and advance to different levels to be able to play new slot games . would definitely recommend this to others !
i really like this game and spend too much time on it . i highly recommend this game to anyone who have a lot of time on their hands .
its really alot of fun it keeps you moving i like it alot back to feeling like a kid again
if you like games that make you come back get this game and make sure you know what your doing
great buy ! so many games of solitaire to chose from ... all with different styles an patterns ... . got ta luv it a good buy for my kindle !
it does what it 's suppose to . does n't do anything more , does n't do anything less . it is exactly what you 'd expect .
it finally gives me a chance to record videos on my kindle . it just makes my kindle much nicer than when 1st purchased ! thank you .
you get words with friends for free on the kindle fire and that the exact same thing as this is , since ot does n't have single player mode .
i love this game ! it is very addictive . i 've only played seven levels but once i start playing it 's hard to stop .
this app is great for me when i need a few minutes to chill and is my favorite board game so far .
this is entertaining just as most slots are ! they do not pay off as well as some . have fun playing .
love it alot , for myself and for the kids nice safe fun . good for age 5 and up to adult .
fun time killer , but every time i get to a high level it freezes , which is super frustrating ! ! i would n't pay money for it unless they fix that problem .
lot of fun . good way to pass the time . keeps you entertained for hours . i would recommend it for all ages .
i just opened it again to see if it is working . i got the up grade message clicked cancel and the page stayed up . clicked on match up and it worked . it 's updating and everything .
the graphics are beautiful and it 's easy to play . very user friendly ; even my grandkids can play it ! i like the battles .
tumblr is a great app to have if you like looking at photos . even if you like looking at your photos or looking other peoples photos ... ... it 's a great app to have .
the food runs out so u cant level up and it did help my child eat but fun puzzles to play .
when ever i exit out of it , the music will keep on playing until i get rid of it . and i also luv it .
i was having a lot of problems with & quot ; program is not responding & quot ; messages . i reinstalled it and works fine now .
the is just too good to be on the kindle fire : ) ps if your wondering if you should buy this the answer is yes !
great game . it 's amazing how many logos you do n't recognize . the international ones are the hardest . i would buy this game .
at first i thought it might be a childish game but as the levels go higher it does get harder its a really cute game im glad i got it
i have spent hours playing this game . the colors hold my attention and the game goes quickly . i would recommend this to anyone who likes solitaire .
this app is amazing . it is up to date and i cant believe all throw things i see . this app is worth $ 0.99 cents i recommend this app
i enjoyed the game , only thing i did n't like about it it did n't have a built in strategy guide . i think the game would have been more enjoyable .
entertaining and challenging . the only downside is that it was only 16 levels . finished it in about two hours . if you 're gon na charge , make it a little more worthwhile .
i like this game because it 's challenging and you can go back to beat your own time . it keeps record of what your time was before and i like that .
super fun and very adicting . so many colors to choose from . it will keep you occupied for many hours . really should download !
i like it that there are both easy puzzles and challenging ones ! one of the better 4 pics 1 word games i have tried
i really suggest this game for little kids my lil sister love this th game thank u doctor panda this is from all kids
a really fun game . have a lot of missions , levels and challenges with tough enemies on it . you will never get bored with it ! .
i like it i wish i can keep as my wallpaper instead of the advertisements i get . very pretty and bright
i love this game , if you love to think then you will love this game too , it really makes your mind think about the riddles that they put in front of you . thanks what the riddle ?
this match 3 can be difficult in 3d . really fun to play . easy load go ahead the price is right !
can not wait to get to a higher level . absolutely addictive . simply a real joy to play with the kids .
this app freezes up on my kindle fire right at the very beginning levels . could not even get through the tutorial part fully . waste of money ... why is this even available on fire ?
this is a great game and a fun time killer .. challenging to play but still fun .. well worth paying for ..
as school i do math and i run in to fractions so this app makes it easy to do the fractions
this game is sooooooo much fun ! i love playing everyday ! it 's not to hard but not to easy , the graphics are cute , and it is an all around fun game .
its a fun game just takes alot of patience to earn work experience . and i need friends so add me please ! ! !
this game is great for passing time . i return over and over . ca n't beat that it 's free to boot . very easy for a wide age variety .
this game starts off fairly easy , but gets more and more difficult as it goes . it is fun and challenging . a great brain exercise .
i chose this rating because once i started playing it i could n't stop ... it is very addicting ... ... .i love it ... ... .i love the match three games ... .
u have to get this game it is exactly like the movies and books but u do n't have enough energy
it 's a great game to share with the young one and it 's also fun to draw by myself , there 's so many choices .
i have n't received my vegas slots order to my kindle , so i do not know how to rate please help me
well , i have only used this app once so far but it seems to be pretty good . i like it . would recommend .
really enjoy this game . have it on my kindle fire and it works great . it has n't froze up like some games really like it .
has a ton of pictures , am easily able to share on my facebook wall when i need help , you earn coins quickly , and the best part is that it 's free !
love this game because i love to look for the hidden objects in this game . i would recommend this game to anybody who likes to look for any objects .
it works well . since kindle does n't have gps it 's not quite as good as maps on my phone , but i would recommend it .
i played this game a long time ago when i was in school , and found it again as i was searching apps , i love this game and so do my kids .
this app is fantastic especially when you have 3 little brothers . ; ) and all the colors really entertain a 1 year old . its fun no matter how old u r .
it is simple , too the point and perfect for little kids ! i did n't get into it but he liked it .
my daughter loves to draw it keeps her busy and the price was right i love my kindle so many things you can do with it
i ca n't play it very long because it becomes real easy for me ! i guess i should upgrade it may be harder !
this game is like the best game ever . if you have n't seen or played it yet then your missing out .
good mystery , locate clues to further game , hidden object scenes , and a variety of other type puzzles . i thought it worth 2.99 i paid .
pictures too dark or too small to find items , i had another member of the family try it with the same results
i downloaded it to try and get movies and tv shows but those do n't work well with my tablet . i have a clone android .
game played fine for a while . but then freezes and forces close a lot . but as far as game play it was a good game .
yes , this game is nearly impossible . but very addicting . maybe i 'll eventually be able to get past level 2 . ( :
ca n't really say too much about it . we never played because it 's so huge we stopped the download . not worth it .
this is ok and since it was free i do n't want to say bad things about it . but it is just ok .
this game is like mario and i like how the ads do n't appear . its really cool because now you can play something like mario on the go
i really like this game because i 'm really good at it so that is why i like it so much i also play a lot so yeah
i absolutely love the animated dinosaurs . however on my kindle fire , it lags , a lot . other than that , get the game . it is well worth the one dollar .
want a bigger brain ? keep the one you got going strong ? this is a great app for you to use !
it 's pretty fun , great controls , cool graphics , definitely recommend this to any racing fan . i play it in my free time . five out of five .
i do n't see anything wrong , its just a little blood , nothing to complain about . its pretty fun , i have beaten three levels by now , its addicting .
the game would be less frustrating if it had a way to gain more time . otherwise some levels are too difficult
i got stuck on it and unable to complete . i removed it from my tablet at this time and may try finishing it later .
i liked it a lot it is a great strategy game but the free version really is limited and only a few minutes of play time before you can restart from the beginning . still fun
this is a pretty good ap the only flaw is you ca n't save the gun you hard on or maybe not
i enjoy this game because it makes me think and it is a lot of fun . i did not realize there were so many steps .
this is a great game and i have really been enjoying it . smooth playing and fast paced , i highly recommend this game for all .
just disappointed is all tried another one and it was much better just seek and you shall find the right one
this was quickly addicting for me . i am playing one more time before bed . the higher levels take more thought so it 's not mindless . great app . htc thunderbolt
i have been playing this game for years and have always loved it . i really enjoy that they have put in more game rooms and more power ups . i can also play it on my kindle .
do n't get this app ! i got this app and you have to download the full version to use the scientific part ! not worth it
this app is good because you can look at people places and things that you might not normally be able to see . plus you can control some of the cameras .
this is such a rip off of temple run . i mean , even the names r somewhat the same ! this app is n't even free ! whats up with that ! this app totally sucks
i also could not download on my kindle ! ! very frustrating and i hate wasting money , please fix . usually love big fish games
these papi games r so much fun to play . they never get boring . this on is my favorite . i recommend this ! : )
this app is really nice and easy to use . i enjoy using it and i love how pinterest just gives me so many ideas and great advice .
this game gets you hooked with the colors and the objective it wants you to achieve . this is a mind challenging game but it is sooooo much fun ! ! !
this is a lot of fun but the controls can be a bit challenging so make sure to get some training before you get in real deep
we use this app every night to get to sleep . i use to use the sleep timer but now we use it throughout the night . love this app !
why use this ? when the phone already does every single thing this app does without wasting more space and battery ?
i like that this game is very challenging . it took me a while to get the hang of it , but once i did , cool .
love this one . play it every chance i get . it also is very challenging . like to see the egg fall .
one of my favorite ways to play word games with my friends . i have many games going all the time . love it ! !
distracting diversion when you need to kill some time . this game is a very challenging , fun picture guessing game . love all the new pictures .
like this calculator for the visual , but it is functional , too . artwork changes from day to day or can pick from gallery : )
this app is real good and let you keep your numbers you should try it out is the best that i see in it is very good
the games really just did n't have any appeal to me to keep playing and keep the app . i really got board with it after and hour .
ok so it is a great game but sometimes will not give up the object even after the hint says it 's there ...
i love this game although i had to pay for the upgrade i think it should have been free but it is still a very fun game : ) ) ) ) ) ) )
i can not select my friends to play with , often 1 of the players leaves the game and i have to start all over again .
a straight forward , old school , puzzle adventure game . puzzles can be difficult but there is an easy to use hint system . nice music .
your babies and pets and sims need care and love . the game is lots of fun my granddaughter loves it .
the game is fun and addicting . i do n't like how few free coins you get and wish the coin bar was larger . i know this is a business but come on guys .
this game is great for small kids they get to have fun with there favorite animals i would get this game for your kids
very fun cooking game for family and friends i would recommend this game for all ages . i absolutely love this game ! ! !
once you get use the the kindle , new to me , this one is really good and easy to manage , now looking for a good solitaire game .
i like have a notepad on my kindle for my monthly bills . so i know how much i 'm spending and have left over .
very good to use when an app does n't want to be uninstalled the normal way . works very well . great app
i like this one but the puzzles are a little hard for my 2 year old grandsons . puzzle pieces are too small for toddlers . i think i will be great when they are a little older .
it looks like the real thing . it 's simply fun ! i do n't know what else to say about this game . it does n't challenge my mind , but i like to play it quite often .
the game is confusing at first , it seemed to take me forever to figure out what i was supposed to do . but once i figured it out i was hooked ! loving it !
game play is quick and intuitive . graphics and sound all great . finished the game in 90 minutes which is why i took 1 star off . but , highly recommend !
nice app to have to quickly pull up the weather conditions for your town , and others . it seems to be in sync with the news channels , and can be checked at anytime .
fun to play . love the drawings and watching me hang -- lol the first couple of times . still makes me smile when i play the game .
i did not care for this game . i do n't think this is my type of game . i just could n't get into the game at all . i will not be trying this again .
i really enjoyed this game . i bought the full game and i have really enjoyed playing it . its not too difficult or too easy . i recommend this game .
i thought the graphics were good and the plot held my attention . i would recommend this game to others . none of these games are 100 % free but i think it is worth the money .
it has very beautiful pictures and i think i will like it better on this larger screen . interesting pictures . so much to do .
this game is loads of fun with clues and puzzles . great and time well spent . i could n't stop playing . great for anyone
i love it the game is very addicting there should be more apps like this . i love the bonus 's . please make more like this
okay this game is fun but challenging if you do n't use the hints . yes this game is slightly creepy but hello look at the name but it is not over the top scary .
i have been waiting for this app on here and i am so excited it is finally here . pinterest gives you so many amazing ideas and lets you tell others about your ideas ! !
love the hbo go app , i can see my favorite shows and movies at any moment without having to wait a set schedule on cable . it is easy to download and use , definitely recommend it .

i got game for my cousin . she liked it i did n't care much for it . after a while i deleted the game .
my kids and i both loved messing with this app . it was really fun to make all the different designs and stuff !
awesome game ! the guy is so cute great that you can change him and his clothes but it grows slightly repetitive after a while but still cute : )
i got this for my kindle fire and you can personalize it enough to make it useful . it 's great for relaxing , meditation or just getting to sleep .
this app actually works . and you can even adjust how much extra boost you need . plus its free . thumbs up
very nice graphics . fun to play . hints are available if needed . a very good hidden object game . easy to play .
well first of all when it says hot or not would like to access , i press ok , then it does n't connect , what 's wrong , fix the app ! ! !
fun game . gets u to thinking ! very easy instructions and starts out easy and gets harder . great game for when u have a few minutes to kill .

it 's a blast to play and is very fast . it 's easy fun everytime . my kids are addicted to it big time .
i love the game ... ... once it gets started . takes to long to get started even after it gets downloaded . very disappointed : (
the solitaire for kindle fire was fun and very easy to play . i would have to give it a five star rating based on the fun factor and as close as you would get to playing solitaire alone !
my boyfriend got this ap for himself but my 8 year old niece has hours of fun playing this really addictive game .
this is a fun puzzle game you ca n't put down . takes a little brain work on getting some of the puzzle pieces off the board . my 14 year old loves it as much as i do .
never used it so i can not say it works great or if it sucks . so i will give it 3 stars
i thought that it was a very basic program and since i am not into reading comic books ... i deleted it .
this is fun and fairly easy . the graphics are great . i like playing just to relax and who does n't like popping bubbles ? : )
love playing word games , and it 's great to play games with others that like to play the same thing . thanks
my grand children love this for drawing pictures . they are always asking if they can draw on my kindle fire

i love to play this game and do n't always have someone to play it with me and i love playing against the computer .
love this game . playing on kindle fire and works great . great graphics and game play . lots of levels that get increasingly challenging . awesome that this was offered as the free app of the day .
used to be a very good app and a good time killer . now i have to pay for single player .
this game is challenging . it starts out easy and then gets really challenging . a good way to stimulate your brain . i love it .
it 's on the amazon store and it is so much fun ! there 's so much levels ! i ca n't believe it was free ! i highly recommend this game
did n't find it very interesting but i am sure many people will , is not bad specially if you can it free .
this game is very fun i gave it 5 * i finished this game in 1 hour i wish i had more money because i what the full version
good game . fun building stuff in a different way . watching the people get into a fight is hilarious . have not been forced into buying the in app purchases yet .
i chose this game because i have temple run and temple run 2. i was not disappointed at all . in this app . just as exciting .
i love playing it because it is such a challenge . but it can be so addictive you just do n't want to stop .
i was not too fond of this app . i enjoy playing this game but this was not as exciting as i was hoping
i love this game ! it is addictive but not to the point that you have to purchase more lives . it goes quickly and is super fun .
easy to use , fairly user-friendly , i have no complaints about this app . word word word word and another word word .
very good game . good pictures for adults and kids . my grandkids love these types of games . so far no bugs in the game .
i love hockey but i do not like this game the kindle is usually fast and way faster than the i pad but this game stinks do not get it !
i like this one because it is a somewhat challenge . there are still some levels i have not reached yet . i would recommend it to everyone . i really like this one .
this app keeps me going on and on , sometimes keeps me up way past my bedtime and i never lose the desire to keep playing . it is one of the few that hold my interest .
first of all i bought it using coins ( what a waste ) it wo n't let me save and let me just say do not buy it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
i love this you get to pick what you want in sounds a nd create your own sounds as well .
once you achieve a certain level of play , you ca n't move forward without a purchase .
this would be a great game if it did n't shut down repeatedly . i played it for an hour and it shut down on me five times . a shame but a waste of your time .
i ca n't get my eyes off of this game ! its so awesome i love the tasks they give you ! i can not wait to make a family it sounds like the best part !
easy steps to follow , really cool art work . i enjoyed using this app to create the characters on the page . i never could have done that without this app . cool .
i think all the casino games are awesome ( some more than others of course ) . i do enjoy the slots most .
i purchased candy crush for my grandkids to use on my kindle but i find it very addicting and have been using it too !
it a fun but really really really really hard so be careful i hope u like this game it great
like this because i like doing word searches and this way i can pull one up anytime , anywhere without having to purchase anything or copy out of a magazine somewhere ; especially in waiting rooms : )
not fun at all . clues are not very good . some clues are too small and others are blurry . a waste
i love it , it is not to hard not to easy . and there are so many games to play , it is like unlimited games
a great game to lie around and play with a loved one . lots of fun , one of the best apps i 've purchased in awhile .
the game was ok , it was more fun hitting the guy then the apple . it was hard trying to hit the apple , so i hit the guy .
so far i am enjoying the app , not the same as the fb game but a fun alternative . takes a while to level up though and not much to do while waiting .
i like this game a lot but it will not let me connect to face book .but other then that i like this game .
far too basic in terms of castle defense games . the game play is n't fun and the graphics could be better . would not recommend it .
this is an awesome app ... everyone should use it . so many wonderful scripture lessons ... and the prayers are great . would recommend to anyone .
i like the game but i need to practice more because i am not able to serve all my customers sometimes i lose some
i love this game and play it a lot ! ! i love the sound effects and the little voice . it is fun and challenging ! i highly recommend it !
used a lot of memory , did n't down load properly was more trouble that it was worth deleted before playing - boo
this is a very helpful tool and has come in handy for me when i was not in the room with the computer
awesome and great graphics , way better then 1st one , and free the best price there is , keep it going with the great games
super fun and really easy but i wish there were more clothes and shoes . but what is there is cute especially for free .
there is absolutely no reason that i should have to be connected to the internet to play a silly puzzle game . uninstalled .
this app is awesome it wakes me up and i wake up to my fav song the picture is blurry but the sound is all that matter
this game is so much fun i wish they had more games just like this one that 's how great of a game this game is ha ha ha ha
guess song quiz is a really fun game if you like quizzes and/or music . but sometimes the piano version of the song sounds entirely different from the original song . but good luck ! z
this game is fun . it helps to pass the time when there is nothing else to do . i literally loss track of time while playing it .
very fun and addicting ! took awhile to get the hang of it on the big kindle fire 8.9 screen but still fun .
have played through this game , definitely keeping it to play through again at some point . it 's cute and not too complicated .
gets boring very soon . i quit after game was half over . try something more interesting . not for me . good try .
i love this game , i ca n't stop playing it . my daughter loves it also , she three and her scores are almost as high as mine .
if u do n't have any money u look like everyone else and u think u are a different player and die every time
i absolutely love this game ! its so fun ! i recomend it for anyone over the age of 6 . i have this game for my kindle fire .
i absolutely enjoy this game . the only problem i 'm having is the new easter room wo n't update . i heard through the chat that this happened the last time they tried to add this game .
my granddaughter 's biggest complaint about this game is that it took so long to build the houses and the park .
i download the app , but did not use it , because i had problem with it on my tablet , so i ca n't really comment on this
i tell myself i 'm going to sit for a couple of minutes and play ultimate jewel but find myself playing much longer ! it 's lots of fun and very enjoyable . recommended for all ages .
everybody loves bejeweled 2 , it helps me to focus so i do enjoy playing it . i think i play every day .
game seemed like it could be fun for a little while . played a few levels , but the controls were driving me crazy .
it gets boring . but overall a good game and i recomend it . i think i just played it to much lol . # addicting
have no use for this right now , might need it later or when i learn how to use it , thats all for now
completely love it ... simple to use and to see even when i ca n't find my glasses ... lol ! ! i 'm glad that you can get it on the kindle fire !
love this game unlike some others i 've played this one is fast paced the missions are challenging but not ridiculously hard . definitely worth downloading .
i rarely play this game . it is a good game , but i get bored just clicking on it . my grandkids like it .
i like the game very addictive . beat it it in one day well less then a day a couple of hours . i wish there was a game that would at least take m a couple of days .
i 've been playing this game for quite a while and i really enjoy playing . i put it down and pick it right back up . before i know it , the day is gone .
i did n't like this very much . this just did not work for me . there are so many more options out there that work better .
i found this memory game was not only fun or created ! enjoyed playing with younger children & played for quite a while .
everytime i tried to login on the app it would just reload back to the blank login page . it lets me login on the computer , not sure why it wont on the app .
i like to play games while i am on my lunch break at work . not being able to turn the sound off really limits where the game can be played .
u should get this app because it was true about my friend . this app is really good it was also it was right about me too .
this app is a great game for people of all ages . there is a little something for everyone ! you should get this app .
i think it is a boss game , it keeps me happy when i 'm sad . this game helps with almost anything . i enjoy it and so will you if you get it !
just another & # 34 ; free & # 34 ; game that ends up asking for money !
a very satisfying past time before going to bed . my husband enjoys this game each day when he is stressed .
this game is fun and easy . relaxing to play . like the tiles . its worth the 99 cents . would buy it again .
i like hidden object games - this one is different than most . i am giving it a 5 rating even though i would like more in-game puzzles . great job big fish .
this game is pretty cool . its a little boring though ... ... ... ..i think the reward should be higher when you solve a word .
fun game but some answers are not realistic and the fast money round does n't reveal the top answers in the end .
one of my favorite bingo games , would really like to have more bonus credits . the bonuses should be given more than every 24 hours .
like most of these games it is very addicting . controls are easy enough just tapping . i have really enjoyed playing this game . works well on my kindle fire .
got this for my daughter and she got bored with it really fast . maybe for lil kids under 7 or so .
great great great really fun love it it 's about time they released it really enjoying it love it love it
if you love connect four this is the game for you . i have n't won against the computer yet ... but my son has , go figure .
it 's a lot of fun . there are so many outfits to choose from . i recommend it to anyone who likes fashion .
so far i have n't gotten very many books , but right now i 'm very happy with the application . and they seem to have a very large selection of different types of books .
fun cant stop playing i wish it was real money i need it ... i got up playing it . not on face book anymore but its still fun
what the heck ? all this app has is a couple of sounds that are n't even close to being annoying . this app is a waste of time .
this is somewhat easier than the original . i enjoy the challenge . i 'd certainly get it for relaxation . it allows you to move on much more quickly and you wo n't be bored .
the effects included work well but i dont see any real good use of these effects in real life . i would not buy again .
i love this app , i can check out my facebook account where ever i am and can get internet . everyone should have it .
this game is just like the show . has it all with out the pressure of being on tv .i highly recomend this one for any fan of the show , and anyone looking for a fun game .
what can i say its a giant calculator app that is free . it does its job for quick needing it
when you play this for the first time , it 's fun . but the replay value just goes down . the developer did a good job , but it could 've been a lot better imo .
this app does a lot . a lot of ways to keep ur notes .
i love the game . i have played it several times and will probably play again and again . it is very challenging .
a very informative news app to keep you update with what is happening around the world as well as in our country .
this falls right in there with letters from nowhere . another great game by g5 . recommend for almost all ages , younger children may find it difficult .
this game is so much fun it is good for when your bord it is a good game to play very fun
i have a kindle fire but it is to small for the screen . i am a big fan of hidden objects but have trouble seeing it .
even with a high score of 3 xd its a epic game because it makes u forget about whats happening around u , and if u like flappy bird , get this
my grand daughter love this app , this is very good for a 20 month old , i will buy more books like this .
i 've enjoyed playing this game a lot . the graphics and writing are excellent . the only problem is how long it takes for the energy points to recharge .
this is a great game to play for all ages . it is fun to see how many characters you can get from the image .
love being able to play with anyone from anywhere . hope you continue with this app and letting us play for free
this is an okay app . but could use better categories . even the & # 34 ; easy & # 34 ; setting is more challenging than some would like .
i love using this app ! it helps keep my mind sharp and now no matter where i am , i can do all kinds of calculations in my head ...
i really enjoy this game ... the graphics are amazing and it was free when i got it . ca n't beat that !
i love this app because you can play with your friends around the world . its awesome if you love scrabble you will love this game . hope this review helps . you will not be dissapointed ! !
can download my favorites and listen to it offline ... .. i love it and think you might too . have n't had any problems with it .
i love to solve riddles and this game has made it fun and easy . it is a game that i would recommend if you love word games and riddles .
this ap is easy 2 use and convenient . i highly recommend it . nothing extra to get in your way . no irritating ads .
almost as good as the app on facebook . put you and your friends in fun comic bit scenes . many to choose from . more added daily .
have always loved this game . nice challenging game . little harder than solitare . but i think everyone would enjoy playing this game . something to do by yourself .
i love this game it 's so much fun i play every day if i 'd change anything it would b for the prices to be better
grandson likes it , he plays it most of the time out of all the other games on the kindle . it is easy for a 1st grader
you can watch clips but if you want long shows log in and if you think this is a bad app think again free full shows and clips this app it worth more than free its a great deal
does not work on the samsung vibrant or the epic . instant force close when opening on both of the two phones .
great product and does more than just the non explorer edition . i would tell all my friends to use this edition . love it .
i love this app , but it is very frustrating for people like me ( total idiots ) . anyway , i got it for free but it is worth the money .
i enjoyed this version on the kindle just as much as my pc version . just like the other dash games it 's a little addicting .
the game was awesome and my kids really loved it and love to play it they have so much fun with it
lots of fun layouts but there is only one way to win , you do get several chances but i want to just win sometimes
love this game as much as the previous games in this series ! you wo n't be disappointed if you enjoy hidden object games .
since i did the first one this one is also good plenty of hidden things , story line is also good also .
it is a nice tool to create some casual art work . it is fun and easy to use . will recommend to friends .
i love pinterest , so having an app . on my kindle is very convenient and useful . definitely should try it if you 've never been on !
this is a great way to have a lot of fun . i have recommended this app to many people . kids really enjoy it .
great game allows you to pick different level of opponents to match your skills . if you enjoy the game of hearts this is the game to pick , would recommend it as great fun
my four year old grandson loves angry birds games of any type . this one is n't too hard for him and he enjoys playing it .
i gave up because i could not figure out how to make this work with my kindle fire . it could be me and not the app .
this game is a good time waster but its not worth a buck . i got it as the free app of the day but its definately a keeper
i like the graphics i find myself playing all the time ! my little one loves it as well as ny hubby .
i love playing solitaire and i do like this app.i usually play it once or twice daily depending on my schedule .
or was very slow and after i got a little way into the game it wanted me to buy the full version . i 'm deleting it off of my kindle fire .
i really have n't had a change to try it because i am always so busy with other thing so i will get to it to really give it a review .
this game and fruit ninja are far my favorite games . fruit slice is very interesting . i do enjoy playing it , more than fruit ninja ! ! ! !
a lot of glitches , but its absolutely adorable and still fun to play i think i like the addition of the animals !
this game was really fun but i had to delete it because of how addicted i got to it and when your on it that much it tends to make your kindle hot and stop running every now and then
i love this game . it is so scary i even had my mom watch me the first times i played this game . you have to get this app if you are a slender fan .
i love this bingo game ! i would recommend it to anyone who likes to play bingo . i just started playing , but i enjoy this game .
hints are reasonable and you can even have the answer solved . some movies are repeated answers . other than that , its a overall good game .
google is a great application is great for any search and its great my family like it and my kids can search anything they want thank you
the game is fun , though the lack of a zoom feature is annoying . but its a one play game . finished it in a few hours and kind of wish i could get a refund .
i find this to be a challenging game . makes you think . keeps my mind active . if you love word games i recommend this game .
love the ability to change the graphics on the tiles ! lot 's of variety of game patterns for you to choose from !
this is a great game . i really enjoy playing and also like that it was a free download . makes a great time waster : )
this game is awesome ! way better than 100 rooms . i enjoy the difficulty of the game but do not find it too challenging . wish it had more levels ! !
this game is really fun and addicting . i do n't have it on my kindle yet but i have played it .
i enjoy playing this game a lot but lately this game has been stopping a lot . i have n't played in two months because everytime i put it it stop . ; /
very nice game to play all throughout the day . i have a lot of time in between doing my daily chores and this is one way to pass the time .
great entertainment and fun for youngest children , so they will stick with this one for a while to learn or perhaps practice things they already know .
cool game once you get the hang of it ! can definitely get hooked , and use up some down time . try it ; )
far to much story and not enough game play . i was expecting more from this , extremely disappointed . deleted soon after download .
really not my kind of game that 's really all i have to say but apparently you require a certain amount of words .
the game is good mindless fun . it makes you realize how often you see logos and do n't connect them to a name .
this game is so addictive even my mom plays this game and i asked her one day if she liked it and she said that she does like coin dozer and i gave it four stars because of the advertisements
this game starts out really really basic but quickly gets you thinking of a solution to be able to move on to the next puzzle .
finally this game ! my dad has had it for a while and i beat him ! finally on kf ! any one who has a kindle fire and is sick of the old games this is a great choice
it is a good game , but needs a lot more levels . i was soon done with this one . it 's not deep enough to purchase however .
this app is so much fun . i ca n't stop playing it . very challenging . a must must must must must must have game . get it .
this is a great game that really keeps your attention . one of the best tower defense games over played so far .
now , i am pretty picky about apps , but this is great ! it 's like scrabble but free ! ! ! i play this every day ! ! !
i liked it when they came out with free style but still i think they need more designs its a disappointment i would n't waste my money on it if i were you
so far so good . i was hoping that all of the games were available at ones but overall it 's a good game .
i have a ball playing this game . i never played the & quot ; real & quot ; version with cards but this one is a blast .
this us a fun little game i would recommend it to others who like the other angry bird games to play
very challanging but it keeps the mind working . this is a great game i love puzzles and thing so this is right up my alley .
have not had the reason to use it yet . but , i assume it is as good as all the other products i get thru amazon .
if you love minecraft , you will love this ! it 's exactly like minecraft , just with 3d characters . ; 3 btw minecraft , y u have price ? d :
this is a great convenient app . it works great and its really simple . its a great app . i used it to wake myself up on christmas day . it has an alarm clock too .
enjoyed this app , , one of the better ive seen . wish it was longer , hope for a update soon . i would like to see the next levels , this is fun .
i love playing with my parents get this app as soon as possible i would recommend this app to all
great game . runs very smooth on my kindle fire hd . i have n't encountered a single issue since i downloaded this awesome game !
this is a fun game that is for all ages . i love this game because it is funny and a fast game to play
not working properly , get stuck and nothing happens when pressing on icons , i prefer to use the web to use this app , very bad , i do not recommend .
faster than turning pages . could not begin to carry everything that is in it . not easy to forget to have it with me .
i like that you can play in different languages , it 's great practice when you are trying to learn a second language . it really makes you think .
i like games like these . they 're a lot of fun to play with the family and of great quality as well
it was really good like the real one on ps3 and it was cool to kill zombies so cool but make it harder
my grandchildren and i have really enjoyed enjoyed . being able to upgrade your game piece is a nice touch . nice game .
this game is fun to play while waiting . the board is nice and easy to see . i get annoyed by the highlights but others may find them helpful .
this game had a good story line . the hidden object scenes were challenging -- though a little dark for my taste on a small tablet screen . but it was a good game and i enjoyed playing it .
i like the way this game gets progressively harder . but it would be nice if more combinations were available to play .
this game is great for my granddaughter it is easy and fun . she can play it in the car nothing else required .
this is great . not nearly enough puzzles but very enjoyable to play each . it was a good price so was well worth it for this mahjong .
nothing wrong with the game , just did not grab me for entertainment . played a few levels and then took of my device
i just goes slow , is my tablet or the app ? i do n't k n o w ! but it 's still nice other than that .
fun game to play . some of the other slot games you do n't get any bonuses , this one you do . received lots of free money too . have lots of fun wasting time with this game .
this game has a different twist on slots with bonuses and level ups . it 's fun to play and keeps you interested in what will come next
my son really likes the stories and will tell me all about them which i think is cute . it keeps his interest in it and will even sing along with it .
but be warned these puzzles are very addictive but good fun . they are very well presented and the graphics are good on my kindle fire .
just bought the full version of this game , love it . great challenge for my memory . fun trying to guess the movies .
i like this game also . i play solitaire a lot with cards so i enjoy playing it on the tablet .
i love word games and absolutely love this app . it relaxes me , makes me think , and passes the time away . it is addicting .
i have no clue what the full idea of this game is . it 's is still something new , and can be fun .
great app to have while your just relaxing anywhere . i love the sound of rain and nature sounds , this is very relaxing
i love these kind of games . this one is a little harder than some . especially if you do n't recognize the logos . just have to do some guessing yo figure some out .
i love this game ! ! ! it has a lot of quests to complete at each level to get you to the next level . it 's very interesting & actually fun .
crashed all the time i never got it to work and deleted after a few hours of trying it . do n't wast your time .
i really enjoyed this app . not only did it tell you the moon phase but it also allows you to view the moon phase a different days
would like a better partner and graphics are easy on the eye . play it everyday and have turned some friends on to it too .
good idea . but if you get stuck that 's it for the game . it need a pass button or something so you can continue paying . otherwise it 's fun .
now its over : ( but i really loved playing it for free it was great fun and very challenging as well
i enjoyed this game . well made and good graphic . i would suggest buying it . worth the money . geared toward older people .
fun game . very addictive , lots of games ads are annoying but the game is great . great time waster too . many games on app .
this game is da bomb ! ! ! ; - ) i love this game but it can get really boring after a long amount of time . ; - )
my child loves to play with this game . the game has several characters to choose from it 's really interactive and fun .
the game is fun , graphics nice , but when you get so far in , you 'll likely be told to wait for updates ... really annoying !
when you 're waiting for words with friends . you can spend hours playing . very happy that it 's free and fun to play .
i really enjoyed the game . only problem i found was i wished there were more levels took part . however the levels available were really fun .
this game is loads of fun , you get to use all kinds of strategies to kill the entire world . i love it .
no instructions horrible play tried for a 20 mind and still could n't get past the first level . would not pay a dime for this .
i like this game , more than most hidden object games . cool mini games and puzzles . not much story background which is refreshing .
tablet version is good and easy to use . it is one of the better versions that is available for electronic devices .
i downloaded this to my kindle fire ... and i use it everyday now . well worth the price . so i downloaded it .
love this game . it keeps your brain on edge and constantly thinking . highly recommended to pass the time and stay busy .
we bought the upgrade and it is her favorite game . little girl , likes to play dress up and loves this game !
i like the fact that it have videos . i 've never had a video bible . thank you for this nice app .
this game is fun . i like that you have unlimited chances to play . i have n't won yet but that 's okay . i 'm trying different strategies .
good mind challenging game i recommend this for older folks trying to keep their minds sharp and challenged i love it
i work to much and i 'm never home to watch my favorite shows . this is perfect for me ! you can even skip commercials !
love this game takes awhile to figure out am stuck but i will get it someday its great fun and time passer
i have only played this once ... i like it so far ... really works your brain .and i am sure it will help me with my other word games ...
my grandaughter ( 6 yrs . ) really enjoys playing this and likes to show her work off . has a lot of choices to pick from .
this is a great app . it is very easy to use . much easier than going to the website and using it .
so far a pretty good game . pretty good graphics and animation . looking at the amount of areas to e expand into could be awesome .
decent game but like others better . works fine on my kindle fire hd . just not as much fun as jewels .
if you enjoy playing slots , this is the app for you . the first slot machine has been in casinos for a long time .
i love this game for a bit more challenging game of solitaire , in my opinion you can never go wrong with solitaire
i hate it because it does n't turn properly and u cant turn . it any easier than tilting your device so fix it and you better
it just seemed like the same thing over and over again . ok , but i sure am glad it was free .
it is awesome i can play this all day no stop this game is so additive . i am so glad it is on my kindle if only . they had it for xbox or wii
it is a pretty good app and is usually right about about my mood ! i like using it a lot !
i really like this game and so do my children . it helps the time go by so fast . if you like bingo then try this one .
this game keeps you on your toes which is good for me and my coordination . fun to play and the grand kids love it . would recommend .
love these games . no time limit is nice when you just want to relax with a game but are still looking for a challenge . sometimes easy , sometimes difficult . but always fun .
bad piggies is a little slow for my taste but a good game , good way to pass the time when stuck in line
it 's getting so hard it 's not much fun to play . i play it now when i have nothing else to do
its an ok game but it does have the con side ! you only get so many colors to use and designs to use ! it also freezes a lot and its not that much fun after a while
i hate it when you get a free app and it is only part of the game . it should say sample .
up to date , easy to read and can check it any where any time . never like to be without the weather channel
this app works perfectly . i reccommend this app for anyone who loves to game . i play this game all the time .
one drawback , there is no storyline , just searching rooms for hidden objects . you can search a room over and over again , which can get boring ...
the original is not as fun as this one ! it is so much better than any other killing games and many more weapons !
the boy likes it but it 's another of those games you get to a certain point then you have to start paying for upgrades .
there really is nothing to do in this app . i am glad that it was free because i would of been upset if i would of had to pay for it .
as soon as i started playing this game , i was instantly hooked on it . fun , challenging and can be a great waste of time at your next doctors appointment .
looks fun . i have yet to play it , but the graphics look good , and the physics look real . looks fun
i like to get the information i need quickly and be on my way . when it comes to the local weather , this app is great .
this app is cool but i just updated it and it made it run very slow so dont buy this
this sounded like a great idea . but after searching for three songs and only getting lyrics for one of those songs i decided to uninstall . it is easier to search on internet and with better results .
i love this game so far it is lots of fun . i think it is a game i will play for a long time .
my 12 year old son wakes up on sat morning and reads for about an hour or so ! this is one of the reasons i got him a tablet !
this is a great game and very challenging . i like it helps you test your memory . math is a very important to do n't forget ever .
when i first started the app , all was well . then i tried to open the app again to check on my birds after a few hours , the app was stuck at loading screen ...
the game is so awesome . i like it better then words with friends . i also like that you get to earn coins and experience .
it 's so cool it 's really fun too like you can verse people and sometimes you might win or loose it does n't matter any way if i were you i rather get this app
this game is fun and you know if you rate you get a hundred coins and you really have to think if your going to play this game so i would get this because it 's fun
i 've only played about half of 1st level and already can feel my brain cells waking up ! not as easy as it looks !
i use fb on my kindle fire , my desktop computers and my phone . i like how the experience is the same across different platforms . solid app .
the buttons on the game is not fit for a tablet . it 's a a good game but better for pc .
fun game . i need better sound on my kindle fire , though . wish my fingers were smaller so that i would n't hit two keys at once !
i give this game 5 stars because its minecraft for hand held devices it is a very cool game
great game that has a lot of action . needs a lot of skill to play . fun game that is good to play whenever .
love this game . keeps your mind working & as we get older , this is something that everyone should be using to keep their brain fresh .
my brain is working hard on this one . great app . played with my grandson and we had a blast figuring out all the clues .
this is entertaining but i have played better , oh well it was free and i will keep playing thank you
this is soooooo crappy ! it did n't repeat a word i said ! do n't waste your time and space on this junk !
game gets 1 star from me because it wont load i would give it 0 stars if i could i hate games that waist my time downloading just to have it freeze on the loading screen
excellent game , very challenging to the mind and is entertaining to all age groups from age 10 to age 70 .
if you like lil kingdom and small street you will probably enjoy this one even more . these are my favorite types of games .
i just started the game . i think the game needs more features . it is entertaining . i ca n't complain since it was a free download .
this was not what i was looking for so i took it off my device . i had some trouble understanding how to navigate it at first but this was probably my problem .
there are only 3 games you can play without having to purchase more to unlock the others . wish it had more to offer .
i enjoy this game ... the graphics are great and it really uses brain power . my only complaint is its too hard to get coins .
i love this game . its so addicting . i play it all the time . its so much fun . i love it .
this a great way to stay updated on your favorite sports teams and all sports in general . i highly recomend it .
this game is an enjoyable app . i find myself to be addicted playing this game . the only problems . i see in the game are if you want to connect and join facebook .
too hard to control . to be honest , i 'm not very good at this game , therefore , i dislike it . so u can download it if you want to , maybe you 'll like it .
not enough challenges , points , or rewards . difficult to win and maintain points when playing the game . hard to achieve next level .
we love angry birds seasons ( my grandson and i ) . we take turns on each level to see who can get the highest score . we love the season 3 halloween version with the ghosts .
i love this game . my dad has it on his iphone , and whenever i play on it that 's one of the main games i play . this game rocks
this is a fun game . i know that when my grandchildren see it they are going to have fun with it as i enjoy playing it .
my 7 years old boy loves it ! it is nice and easy . we love it and recommend it . for every kid .
well you would have to buy the better version to get a password and stuff . so if you would even bother to get this app , get the paid version .
the game functions flawlessly , and the graphics are very good . the game does everything i want , and it is free . one ca n't ask for more ...
this game is so much fun , before you know it you 'll have played for an hour . i absolutely love love love this game ! ! ! ! ! ! !
this is alot of fun and really helps when no wifi available and you need something to help you pass the time .
this is the perfect game . of it 's kind this game gives you a way out if you do not know the answer . good for all ages
i love this app . the animals are super cute . it is super addicting and it gives you a whole world of fun right at your finger tips .
a little disappointed with this game . i really did expect a lot more , but it really fell short of my expectations .
i got this app for my son as he is learning to spell . it works great . very entertaining and the parent controls are cool . even my little girls are getting the hang of it .
this is a fun little arcade game . i wish there was a way to connect all the different little games so it would be easier to just jump back and forth between them .
love playing mahjong , for some reason this one just does n't do it for me . there are plenty of other options out there that are better .
the game was really not like the card game . the instruction were not clear . sure glad the game was free .
it 's tight i get to built my own gun o and add me to your friends awesomeness ya really easy to get free coins
i really like how it will flash when there is a number on either card . different from other bingo games
i love it ! it helps me to stay in touch with family [ especially those living out of state ] and friends .
it 's awesome and fun and maybe a little hard for some people in my opinion it is a go game and i wish there were more free games .
too many distraction ads on this . it 's probably fun but i did n't use it as much as others . not sure what else to say .
so fun and so addictive , this is one of the best apps i have had , great graphics , amazing sound effects and very addictive gameplay
not used to this type of game but it is fun so far . a little more info on what 's happening would be nice because i 'm not quite sure what i 'm doing .
great story , great controls , nice balance of puzzles and ho . would definitely get the sequel . only improvement would be to make puzzles a little more challenging .
i love this game it has great graphics and is very addicting . it 's like fruit ninja but with a way cooler twist on it . i cant wait for more areas to be added !
yep , i use it a lot and still installed but prefer more control to add items to remove or & # 34 ; kill & # 34 ; .
this is a game worth getting . the graphics are really spectacular . this is really addicting and a lot of fun .
this game is fun and good looking but gets very hard . i hate that you have to pay real money for all the upgrades .
i enjoyed this game . the colors are crisp , just like a winter day . the game is fun . i enjoyed the challenges . no major surprises to upset young players .
it 's an ok app . most of the logos they show are the same ones shown in the other logos app game . it 's free , though , so no complaints .
i like the size of the cards and the speed at which the game moves . i miss having a hint button , the only way to try different solutions is to undo moves , which can get tedious .
it is one of the best apps ive ever had but it took like freaking 5 minutes to download . other than that awesome app
my husband enjoyed playing solitaire so thought he might like this version . he enjoyed it on the tablet and would recommend it to others .
if your looking for a fun simple spades game . this is it . i play it on my kindle and htc evo phone .
i love all the comics , i have been able to purchase . they have change a lot of the ones i use to read . i look forward to find more favorites
this game keeps me occupied for hours . very addicting and easy to play . i recommend it to anyone who likes zoo games or city building games !
finally i can play my favorite game ever ! ! ! ! ! ! i am so happy i already beat 3 levels in one night and need help to board !
just making and popping bubbles , nothing to it . my son got bored quite fast and had to figure other things to do .
i really like this game . it makes you think and let 's you be creative at the same time great game should download it .
this is not the best or the worse app i personally have used before but it just was not my thing
it is very similar to flow free and it takes up time if your are bored and is very fun to play ! ! !
wish the trial version was longer . really gets you into it then it 's over . fun and requires you to be thinking
i have no problems with the game ( kindle fire ) . i like it when i want something to challenge myself . i recommend this game to everyone .
this game is a fun way to pass the time by and it 's great where ever you are even with friends or family . it 's a great challenge , which is what i look for in games .
it is over all in my opinion one the worst logo games out there . the only thing good about is it is free .
this is a great app for my children . they have fun with it . i would certainly recommend this app for any young child who loves star wars .
just right for the halloween season . i like it a lot . good selection of tones . lots and lots off un
is much like bejeweled but less expensive . would love to see a few more levels otherwise good game . happy gaming everyone !
fun . some icons are tiny on kindle , but very entertaining . i would recommend this game to anyone that likes hidden objects .
i have this app on my phone . love it cant put this game down if not playing on phone then on my kindle ! !
i have not figured out exactly how to play this . the matching of balls i like but not enough instructions at the beginning to suit me . i sure hope to learn more about this one .
this game takes online multiplayer games to the next level . it takes a while to learn the different aspects , but overall it runs smoothly and is extremely fun .
challenges your brain . some answers obvious , others not so much . i am using my hints too much . i have to give myself time to work it out .
the graphics are amazing . this is how people feel and imagine what they can to their bosses . great display . so addictive
love this game . brings back a lot of memories . completely forgot about some of this stuff . it 's a must have if you grew up in the 90s
best game ever ! ! get this game it is awesome ! ! ! ! just wish i could get all the animals & hellip ; but besides that i am perfectly happy with this game ! very addicting !
fun and challenging . worth the cost . i definitely recommend this game if you are looking for a casual game to relax and play . very enjoyable .
the games are ok. i like other games better but it does pass the time . it is free , so it is worth what i paid for it
not much fun.i just could n't get into it . it was a waste of space on my kindle fire . i deleted the game soon after downloading it .
fun and got the kids attention when a robot voice started talking to them . simple interface . could use a few more voice types .
great for all ages ! it is a game that can entertain many . we had so much fun playing this search !
this game is challenging and fun . it keeps you interested for hours . i recommend this game to young and old ad it is fun for all .

different games and challenging times . i loved these games and everyone is exciting . i really like it when you get stuck you can redo the tiles and keep on going ! !
i like the game a lot this game is so much better than paper toss and paper toss is very slow but office jerk is very fast

this game rocks its fun and amazing that my kindle fire hd can get this great of graphics without internet all the time .
i absolutely love this app . it is so realistic and very fun to do . i am so amazed how well the pics turn out . great job .
this is a great game to play all night long . the battles all tough some of the time , but not always ...
a very fun and challenging word association game . some were a little too easy but is good for all ages .
when i first loaded this game it worked fine . but lately it seems to be crashing just about every time i try to play . it is fun when it works .
this is just pictures of rooms ... .you can look through 5 or 6 pics , for different rooms in the house , to help get ideas on decorating . there is no designing anything yourself .
just like you watch on the tv would get this game again only draw back are the people wasting time
can mojang please add minecraft pocket edition ? i want it so bad . it 's just not fair that amazon is missing so many apps .
awsome game the stick figures really made me laugh ! ! great game and its free ! ! ! this game is good for all ages
it 's a puzzle game . it does have pretty pictures but it 's not what i thought it would be at all .
that is all i can really say about it . it 's not amazing but it does n't suck either . it 's nice to pass time with .
this game is sooo addicting ! love that it is a fast and easy game . get your friends together and have a fun time .
with my job i need all the help i can get to on time . this app does a fine job of that ! very nice .
this is a great game . i just can not pull myself away from it , i am hooked . hope you will get further updates . 5 stars .
this app was a bigger pain than it was worth . i had more trouble with my phone after i installed it and the trouble ended when i removed it .
i love it ca n't wait to use it on my new kindle great value and i 'm excited happy happy joy joy ! ! ! !
dumb ways to die is an epic game ! i love how you can watch the music video once you unlock enough points . now the song is stuck in my head . whoever invented this game is genius .
fun and challenging to try to decide what all four pictures have in common . a joy to play with the whole family .
it was not free yesterday when i got it but even though it was not free when i got it so worth it i love the game
it was entertaining i enjoy playing it the levels were quite nice . love playing this game one rainy afternoon . quite enjoyable
the game is interesting in itself and works like most other games of its type . earning enough cash flow to finish tasks takes a lot of time and patience .
i got this app for my children because all of their friends play this game . they love it . i find them playing the game whenever they can . it certainly keeps their interest .
this app does not work as it is described . it needs updated or something . maybe it just does n't work on my android .
i love this game . it 's a good thing real money is n't involved or i would be in big trouble . lots of fun .
i went searching for a different mahjong game . i think you 'll like this one . it 's quick & amp ; easy . you 'll be able to share this one with young kids , too .
i like this little flip but i really do n't use it . it is fun to use and holds many words .
if your a fan then they got it right . great interactive features and an overall good experience . i highly recommend .
the app was fine , the cost of the service you need to sign up to use it , is too costly .
i 've always enjoyed zuma games and this is a very fun one to have on my kindle . i would strongly recommend this version .
no bugs . no crashes . it is just such a fun and amazing game to play and one of the best parts is that it 's free !
best game ever if u have n't played u need to get it and it 's free and if u like to drive this is your game .
i do not enjoy this game . i find it pointless and frustrating . no real fun to it at all for me .
just started this game and love it . easy to use and gives you hours of play time with extra bonus that i like
can only enter 1 room then you have to pay for any others you would like to enter . good luck
i really enjoyed this game . and an added extra is that it was free of charge . i would definately recommend this app to anyone who likes solitaire games .
this app is stupid i cant even play my own songs when i try and you only have like 3 choices its stupid but their are better games and i know . im not happy with the app
why is it there are no directions for any of these games ? we found this game had very little for the child to do .
a great game , ca n't believe that it is free . my kids love it . i 'm also addicted to it and it helps pass the time . great job !
would have more ways to count the calories and more ways of exercise but mostly good , there was very few working exercises
this game is awesome i liv it anyone who is anyone should try it so if ur human you need this game
its ok. a skip button would be nice and the clips could be a few seconds longer . overall , a decent way to pass the time .
it is wonderful i love it u should download it it is awesome . just like the computer version so ya ... .
this is a great brain teaser . lots of fun and very addictive . sometimes i ca n't put it down . great fun ! ! ! ! !
i like this game . it is fun to play alone or with a friend . the colors are bright and easy to look at . if you like word games this is good .
i love this wallpaper because there are so many . you can keep changing daily and still have some left . they are sooooo cute !
i use a kindle and i have had no problems . even logging in through facebook or otherwise . i love it , great game for almost all ages . as long as you know how to doodle .
great for kids . my daughter loves this app ! ! ca n't get her off of it ! it 's perfect for children and its free !
i would rather play by myself . i do n't like games where i have to contact other people on the internet .
this game is awesome i think everyone would get it it is cool to it can be tricky and fun at the same time .
i have found so many great ideas , beautiful places and fun things ! i always have a good time being on this site .
love hidden object games , this ones fun . get yours and enjoy . graphics are great and the story line is pretty good too .
i could never get this thing to work properly and because of that , i ended up deleting it without being able to use it even once .
great game . puzzles are no too challenging but graphics were great . definitely better quality and more entertaining than lots of the games out there . loved the storyline . highly recommend
this game is just ok. i did n't feel it worked as good as it should . sometimes it was hard to see items .
the reason , people it goes so quick , is because its a challenge . the purpose is to test your sight abilities and increase your reflexes .
i love the channel and love this app . awesome app . it keeps you up to date and very informative . love it .
this is one of the best mahjong style games around . plenty of layouts , tile sets and backgrounds to make it feel like a new game each and every time.i highly recommend this app to everyone .
i give this game a 5 stars , love playing with friends ... .so who ever has doubt , just try it for yourself ... . awesome game ! ! ! !
if you love numbers , this puzzle game is a great break from regular sudoku ! great stress relief for me ! if you do n't enjoy figuring simple numbers , you probably wo n't love this game !
i like this game wish there was more like it . a little too easy ! went threw it very fast over and over again .
original game so its a good game but the newer versions are amazing and more fun and interesting plus i like that you can hit more than pigs to get points
use it on my samsung galaxy note all the time . display is effective and has all functionality as online banking website .
dumb ways to die is a great game , but the worst part is that there are a lot of adds and the video is really funny you should get this game
another one for the grandson . he enjoys playing games and i really do not understand some of them but as long as he has fun that is the main thing .
i downloaded this on the fourth of july . wow ! it even has quiet sound effects . i got a real kick out of this and passed it around the living room for my family to play .
enjoying solving the puzzles and hidden object screens . great graphics ! my one complaint would be the price of the full app . free app only lets you do part of the story . kind of expensive .
this game is awesome but extremely difficult because you have to go through the pipes perfectly . if you do n't then you die .
very entertaining . keeps your mind working to figure out the words . does not cost too many coins when you need a hint .
it seems so easy at first but as the levels increase it gets quite difficult . it is not boring or repetitious . it is possible to play without purchasing anything . it definitely helps pass the time .
i chose this rating for this game because i enjoy taking the shapes to make a picture . i would recommend this game to others .
i love any kind of game that makes me work to win . love the graphics and recommend this game to everyone .
interesting and fun . sometimes very easy then you might get one that is really frustrating . i had one that i knew but could n't come up with . ended up looking for the name on the web .
i have a similar game that i play more because scrabble sometimes freezes up on my kindle . i have n't tried playing it with someone yet , so hopefully i will like it better after that .
i do n't like it because it was not loading the show and it was a waste of time . that is why i do n't like it
i need to be able to quickly convert money on my upcoming trip and it will be very handy to have it on my phone
i like the themes and puzzles the interruptions during your game which is timed is extremely annoying i think it 's a 2 1/2 star but ca n't put in the 1/2
this is a really good app . it allows u to watch your shows on the go and best of all its free .
this is a well made game . it is a lot of fun , relaxing , challenging , and beautiful . i 'm really glad they keep making more of these games .
i have several of your hidden mystery games , and i really like them , but after a while they become to obvious , and are not a challenge .
this game is fun . it keeps you entertained all the time , i love the new levels created for the seasons , ca n't wait for the next season ,
really only did it when i could not sleep at night , so when it was the last possible thing left .
my husband is constantly complaining about this app , according to him it is a waste of time unless they improve it .
this is a cute game but hard . my 2 kids love it too . i really love this game its better then the old ones . please make more levels ! so awesome ! best game ever .
a fun little game , a bit confusing in places , but a very enjoyable game almost any age can enjoy and graphics are great .
awesome , addicting game , easy to learn and build your strength . my son loves it , plays it daily beautiful done game
i like this game , it 's like tetris with numbers . it gives me a good mental workout and is a great way to pass a little time while waiting at the doctor 's office .
its so fun i like it but it also sucks cause u dont get much energy so u cant it that long but like like i said it is a amazing game and i really do suggest it
i watch disney channel . they have an ad for this game that says you can download it free from the app store . personally i think you should just get the regular free temple run until this is free
love this game the best game i got on my kindle fire since i got my kindle cant stop playing this game
i am really going to enjoy this i love being able to listen to the bible and read along . thanks
makes you think not the best game i 've played but it is a thinking game . i would recommend it to adults
a good way to pass the time with several board designs to choose from . i would recommend this to a friend
we have . a lot of fun playing this game . it brings us together . so for a few hour 's a day we laugh make fun of are answers .
i like puzzles and hidden object games . this got good reviews , so i tried it . glad i did . hope more rooms get added soon .
i like the application and it seems to be working very well , i will give this app a complete work out in a few days just to be sure .
works great on my kindle fire . nothing spectacular , but the graphics are good , the game gets more & amp ; more challenging as you go .
game moves very slowly , but i guess it just takes time . i 've been playing for 3 days . have n't seen much change .
my granddaughter downloaded this game because she loves to draw and create cool pictures . she likes it , but gets bored of it after a short time .
this a great card game . it is a great way to pass the time . plus it is fun to play and collect the cards within the game .
i recommend this delightful game . and if i were to give this a rating i would give them four stars i hope this game brings you pleasure and joy
really nice game . can win and not pay but frequently gets laggy . every time i 've played its happened . otherwise great game
this game is so so so so so so so fun . i think you will love it buy it please . my cousins always play it . the best part is that its free .
my son plays this all the time . he knows his shapes pretty well and he loves having to & # 34 ; find & # 34 ; the different shapes and different colors . i totally recommend this .
this is the greatest alarm app i have had the opportunity to experience and i am glad i chose it .
this game is really fun except there is no way to earn gems unless you buy them and a lot of things they want you to use gems on .
it was not a bad game . it was a little boring and hard for my 4 yr old . it was n't exciting enough .
fun app ! each level gets a tiny bit more difficult . really enjoy playing & trying to figure out the steps for each game !
i love this app , the only downside is you have to wait 30 minutes for one life , or ask your facebook friends . if you do n't have a facebook account , then play at your own boredom
its a good app the only problem is once you make a alarm all you can do is not have it go off
this game is a lot of fun . the graphics are nice . it has pretty good replay value . try it you 'll enjoy it too .
so cool i play it all the time i play it so much that i 've beat adventure like 14 times lol ! ! so if you want to get addicted get it ! ! ! ! !
i enjoy this app game to test my knowledge of the bible . it has many good and interesting questions . highly recommended
i was disappointed . there was no tutorial and i was n't sure how it worked . i would not recommend this version of this game .
love this ! very fun and addictive . the best part is not really having to spend money to get the full experience . worth my time !
my son loves this game . he is 11 and this show is what helped me to interest him in god . i only wish there were more free .
i love the game so it got a 5 star but we need that update that has been out for over a month this is ridiculous
i 'm either getting too good at this or the games are getting too simple . but i ca n't stop playing the damn thing !
i like this app as it contains information on all the major sports . it has scores , it keeps up with stats and gets the latest news to you in sports as they happen .
we needed it to read certain books . i think it should of came with the kindle fire for what we paid for the item
it is a puzzle i like doing . glad to find it for kindle . now i can play or read on the same device .
my daughter loves this app and it is very easy for her to navigate . it makes learning fun for her .
the controls are quite awkward and made the game frustrating . i deleted the game after ten minutes . do n't bother with it .
i enjoy this , it works well , you can chose the colors with each entry , it helps me stay a little more organized .
downloaded this game for my kid . i thought it looked incredibly stupid but after i tried it , i could n't put it down . it 's actually way more fun and challenging than it appears .
this app does not have enough games it really starts to get boring . would be a good app if they added more like what they have online .
highly addictive and challenging game . the graphics are adorable . i love the music and the story . i ca n't wait for more levels to come !
i think this is a great app in all . it looks great and makes a good screen saver . though it is expensive , i think it is worth the money
this is a fun game . easy to play and just as good as the one you find on your pc . i love it on the fire
do not buy this , it is a waste of time and a waste of money . this is n't even worth getting for free .
i use this app ( on my kindle fire ) constantly when i 'm working in the kitchen . after i set the timer , i play a game of read ... . best of both worlds .
very cool app.i love this app i can play so many games and i love that its challenging and very addicting
it is ok easy to play . not as good as bingo blitz . but works fine . easy to loose and can play with kindle fire .
so far so good with this game . you really have to think about what to do next . it seems confusing at first but hopefully it gets better .
i just downloaded pop the pic . and so far i love the game and so does my two year old does too
my daughter enjoyed the animals and their sounds . she had lots of fun but i do n't recommend it for older children
i ca n't figure out what 's happening to to game it wont let me play other than that it 's alright the game doesnt make much sense but hey its free
my daughter enjoys using this . she is 2 , and was able to learn it rather quickly . she does have trouble changing back and forth between colors , but enjoys it .
the touch feature was easy to use for my 2 year old grandson . graphics and sound effects were very good and held his attention .
i like it it helps me pass time when bored i also think it a very cute game my daughter really enjoys the game as well
great game fun for passing time i recommend this game to anyone ... ... . definitely get this game its worth it ! ! thanks glue mobile
fun i am enjoying playing this game and find it to be very challenging as i get further into the game .
this is what i like to do when i am relaxing or on a long ride . it 's always good to challenge your mind .
this game is the best and it lets you get free everything and if you rate it get free gifts
a good little risk clone . the interface is easy enough , and the game overall is responsive and fun . worth your time .
i saw the movie and loved it so i gave the game a try . i love it ! never going to uninstall
my grand s on loves this again you have to use both hands to play . : have fun and good luck get the high score .
my daughter likes this game . but unless you are willing to spend money to upgrade it is very limited . but good for keeping kids entertained at doctors office .
the game gets a pretty dull after awhile . i 'm over boring scrolling games . pass on this application if your looking for a good time waster while waiting for appointments .
the game is like no other it has more features , objectives , and much more . it is challenging and should be tried out at least .
i love how you can move the whole line up and down to line the creatures up and even if you do n't line it up perfectly it still pops
i now have it running on everyone of my devices . bad thing is they do n't sync together i wish they would
i would have given it a 5 star rating , except it freezes up about 1 out of every 3 battles . but it is fun and entertaining even with this minor glitch .
this game needs some definite upgrades . the game reminds me of some of the atari game s of yesterday . too bad .
this app is terrible . it is just puzzles . just puzzles , and not a decent amount either . 4 puzzles . do not get it
would be nice if you could skip and if you did n't have to have all in one level to move on to the next .
wish there was more to the bonus , but maybe it will get better as the levels increase . decent so far .
it is so fun because you can make rides you collect coins people come to see and tips are save gold get water and lovely food .
i think that it is kinds cool that is like cute the rope but they could have made it even better so it did n't look like cut the rope ... ; )
this game is way better than other games like this . i 'd say this game comes out at the top . i suggest getting it .
i am very disappointed with the game . i wish there was more instruction as i seem unable to figure it out and frustrated .
i like this it really makes you think and i do get stumped . i think it might be too hard for younger children . my husband enjoys this also
this is as much fun as the original . just hard enough to make you think but not so hard that you get frustrated with it .
i give this app a 5 star because it does exactly what i wanted it for . so there ya go .
enjoyed it . bummer the free version was so short . do n't think i 'll pay $ 2.99 to continue though . it seems too much for this game .
it took forever to download . i had to delete it because my kindle locked up when i would try to play it .
great fun game but lots of ads but they make sense for a game being free . download this app , it is amazing !
this is a fun & amp ; different word game . the last update added 60 more levels . once you get the hang of it , you 'll be hooked .
it alright puzzle are easier to put together since they are only about 30 pieces . it something fun to do if bored or have spare time
though it is taking me some time to learn , it is fun learning how to play . once i learn more i will play more .
this is a fun game . wonderful app to have . lots of fun and it is very different from the other apps on my phone . absolutely love it
just started playing this and its fun but some puzzles are quite hard . i wish there was a skip button instead of being stuck for hours
i love this game and would recommend to anyone who likes this type of game , i can spend hours playing this game .
i 'm a 14 years old and this is my favorite game on my kindle . i recommend this for anyone ... ... . it is fun to mix and match all the outfits
this is my go to game to have fun and relax . more fun and changing than regular solitary . i play this game the most of all the games i have .
the hardest fast past most amazing game in the world i would recommend this game to very one it 's awesome .
it 's ok , but just a picture of where i am . i probably could make it useful , but do n't use it much .
if you have to go on twitter get it . but it is still in the new stage . very confusing ! .
granddaughter loves this game . she is 4 and counts the hidden eggs and really enjoys the puzzles . would recommend this game for young children .
this game is really good it makes you think and also try to figure out . just what they have in common to get the word .
i love this app you can rank up and have your own farm and meet new people i recommend this game
do n't waste your time on this app.it is fun but it made me start all over ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! this app deserves 1 star .
the great thing about this app is that it helps you waste time when you have nothing else to do ( you can draw some pretty stuff sometimes too ! )
it 's the first time i have ever played any type of game on line , i really like it and i now prefer to play on line than against the computer .
just downloaded it ! my son already loves it ! great graphics too ! now i have to fight to get my kindle back from him !
i love this game its a lots of fun but very addictive i now have my whole family playing this game .
just got it because it was a free month , i would n't order it again , i ca n't read and listen at the same time .
i love this game . it is terribly addicting . the colors and graphics are great . now i see what all the fuss is about .
i play this a great deal . the game is quick and when playing against the computer is competitive . very nice .
nice game for the holiday . starts pretty easy and gets harder . like the fact that there 's different difficulty levels . if u like fruit drops you will love this game !
this game is great and really keeps you interested in the plot . great if your a fan of tap zoo or tiny village . try it..
this game is really challenging and fun ! you have to think about it to solve the puzzles but it is so much fun to save the little drop people . highly entertaining !
i hate this game everytime i threw the ball it went inside the hole do not download this game ok ! ! ! !
not what i thought it was going to be . play it every once n a while , a little too young for me .
some of the games are pretty easy , but as you get farther along , they get challenging . great to play any time .
its a very fun game just be warned i would n't recommend to ten or younger haha no joke but i still love this game ! ! ! !
was n't . sure about my choice at first but turns out its lots of fun . can be addicting at times , lol but lots of fun
sorry you game lovers ... i did n't like it ... i mean not enough to buy it . i 'm not really sure why i really did n't like the game .
love word games and this is a great one . just hard enough to keep me thinking but not so hard that i get frustrated .
i love this game ! also , if you running low on coins and it 's late at night , go to sleep and wake up with so many coins .
nice ap , easy to use . i personally do n't use it very often , but my wife loves it , seems easy enough .
this is n't skype compatible , and if i recall correctly , it was n't compatible with many of the most popular im programs .
easy game to play . you level up pretty fast . i have not found any issues so far . great game to kill time with .
you do n't get to do anything really . all you do is dress her up . it 's so boring . nothing to do .
enjoyed the game and graphics but like most of the g5 games it is too short for the price . only bought it cause i love these types of games there are cheaper ones with more levels .
initially i enjoyed this game , but now i find it boring . with another version , i occasionally had success . any suggestions ?
i was only able to do 3 puzzles and it freezes . not worth the time to try and download this puzzle .
quite a fun app . always looking for answers while driving or reading advertisements in magazines . i highly recommend this app !
i enjoyed this game . addictive until you are able to beat it . fun way to pass the time away . would recommend .
i 've loved pac-man since i was a kid . i really like this game , but it 's really hard to maneuver pac-man around the maze .
fun , but a little slower than other bingo games of this type . still fun , just wish you could get more plays .
personally , i love this game ! yes you have to download it and it takes up some space but on the kindle fire its not bad at all ! love it !
this is easy to see and use . it has all the basic features i need in my life , since i do n't need complicated math .
this game is pretty cool , it 's free to play but you have to pay for the extras . i 've found that i do n't really need anything extra though .
this is awesome fun to play plenty of characters to collect . i started playing not having the console game but now i want it .
it is a fun game . you can feed your horse and play with it too . i suggest this game to animal lovers or if your mom wo n't get you a pony for christmas . lol : p
i am going to try to continue to play it but i ca n't get around in it . it is a little bit hard to learn how to use .
i did not care for this game . it was too short and not very interesting . might be suitable for a younger person .
this game is fun . surprisingly easy and hard at the same . sounds are not annoying . colors are pleasing . fun for all ages
i do play this game . i do n't play this one too much . i do like it because i can play on my kindle .
wish that i could make it bigger though makes you think about your next move ! fun fun fun fun fun
i 'm a girl and i like this app my step brother had it on his kindle so i decided to get it
love this app , lots of things to look at . like looking for interesting videos . great variety and fun looking at all the different types of videos on there
i like this app so much because i can scanner all my documents and save this in my kindle . i share this information with my friends in an easy way .
easy enough for anyone to play . you can also adjust levels on all games to better suit your skill level . simple and beautiful layout . would recommend for all who want to exercise their brain .
really amazing game and amazing graphic kind of slow sometimes not always . i would recommend this game to many others
wow . this game is fun it cost 0.99 on the first day ... but still pricey but fun get this app
enjoying it immensely ! very challenging ... hope it continues ! have n't quite figured it out yet , but that is what makes it so interesting ! ! !
not one of my faces . you should try it for yourself you may or my not like the game . i just was not impressed with it .
wow this game is so fun . there 's 101 games in 1 game and there so addicting . i think you should get this game .
this game is fun . you get to create anything you want . makes it kind of exciting to do . never know what the limited edition items are .
this game is good ! i like that there are no hidden objects and the puzzles are not ridiculously hard ! it has kept me entertained for hours and what a great price ! !
this app is really good . i suggest getting this app because it 's lot like minecraft pe . also it 's free ! so have fun playing guys !
this app is really good there is a decent variety of sounds to help me relax and fall asleep . it also seems to help keep me asleep .
it was a challenge at first but then things began to fall into place and i have got great enjoyment from the game since then .
this game is way too addicting especially if you like to get three stars on every level . get this game it a good challenge and you wo n't get bored .
i hope to see more updates improvements .i enjoy this game it 's fun and exciting and new to me as well the board game with the dice is a must .i give this application a five stars rate
i did n't like this product . i deleted it immediately . it was not a fun game to play . it confused me and bored me .
please fix this i loved it and i always played it but now i cant beacause its to choppy you can never do anything when it is that choppy so please fix it
my granddaughters really love playing this game a lot . i would recommend this game to all children .
good game it is the best game i ever played buy the app it is the best play the game
if you 've played angry birds before , what can i say that you do n't already know ? there just are n't enough levels , but then , what 's enough ?
i have played so many good games in my life but this takes the cake . you shoot , wins , and kill , the things on want in a game . this game will not disappoint you !
i 've added several words to my vocabulary playing this game . i thought it might be too easy , but i was pleasantly surprised .
just wanted something to keep tablet safe , so far it seems to provide all the security that is needed to keep my tablet safe .
with this app it makes it a very fast way to look up things you might want to get so you can shop faster . : )
my 4 and 8 year old really enjoyed this app , , it got a little hard for my 4 year old but my 8 year had no problem and really liked it
again could not download because of the size of tablet i have , otherwise i think it would have been fine
it was fun and all for a while but this is just one of those games that gets very boring after awhile
i really like this game but it is a slow pace game . it needs more options and stuff to do .
i love this game ! wish i could play it on my iphone though . it 's almost as good as words with friends .
great game and nice graphics . great way to relax and have fun . would like more games like this . hope they do a second one .
the fireworks are really nice . just wish they would tell you how many rounds to game . it is fun anyway .
since i have downloaded it , i ca n't stop playing , works very well on kindle fire hd , graphics and sounds are very well put together .
just started the game can not give a honest opinion trying to get past the people . it looks to be a great game so far .
this is an excellent application i love the fact that i can watch any show that i 've missed or find new ones to watch
easy to use and fun to play . love the way the colors are bright . wish there was more than just one game for 2 minutes .
maybe a good app , however unable to install on my phone . have it 3 stars for dev benefit . maybe suitable for higher end devices .
this is a good app do n't get me wrong its bad but if they made better free upgraded ones this one would not get many reviews and people to use it
enjoyed playing this game . very easy interface takes some thinking though to clear the board , but a great app to purchase
my kids love playing this game . i catch myself sometimes playing it to try to help the kids get to the next level .
feed the fish , watch them grow then sell them . what else can i say ? is not freezing up , loads fine , a decent time killer while waiting .
some pictures are easy and others make you think outside the & # 34 ; box & # 34 ; . fun way to pass the time and keep your mind active .
this game is a great game to play especially when you are wanting to have fun and be a kid again
lots of fun for kids ! also this is a great value since they put basically 2 games in one . recommended !
did not really enjoy this game . i did not want to waste storage on my kindle fire for this . much better game out there .
very cute and easy to learn how to use . some of the words are to big for me to understand but love this app .
i do n't understand the need for this . android already has this functionality built in . just hit menu and & quot ; save for offline reading & quot ; .
this is the typical solitaire game , not much to say about it only that i love solitaire and i like this game .
this game keeps my grandkids busy . they beg to play it on my kindle fire whenever i visit them . i 've watched , and it really does seem fun .
it 's a very special and challenging game . it keeps you thinking , because some of them are so easy you know them when you see them , but some can be a challenge ! ! ! !
it 's fun but i got bored after awhile . i play to pass time . it could be a bit more challenging .
this plays just like the one on my computer and actually is my new morning addiction waiting to get to work . love it ! and so does the rest of my family .
my 3 year old grandson likes this . i think it 's a hair advanced for him but he enjoys it . creative and teaches early thinking skills .
fast . good graphics . simple . not limited by energy . does n't require you to buy extra stuff . highly recomend . cute characters . love it
this game is fun but not as fun as the other 4 words 1 picture but is still a fun game
big fish never lets me down with their games . the graphics are so good . this is a relaxing , just chill ' n type of a game .
this is a great game i love this game so so much its better than cake maker original i think that u should get this app
it 's a very fun game for children as well as for adults . if you love animals this game is for you .
this app works well on kindle fire . plenty of & quot ; wild card & quot ; tiles . very easy so far . no complaints from me .
nice puzzles . it can really make you think at times so good for your mind . good way to past the time when you have time to spare .
i like that they move fast . the characters r very nicely drawn . it 's not hard to get the hang of it . cool game !
this game is very addictive . cant seem to put it down . love it so much . i share this game with my kids .
this game is addicting ... i love playing it ! ! i lose track of time when i start to play . it is one of the best games that i have played in a while .
says it 's free , and it is . but you ca n't access the content unless you already subscribe to stars . not worth your time unless you already subscribe .
i thought this was an incredibly boring game . i have already deleted it from my kindle -- ugh !
this puzzle was not what i expected . i found no instructions to help me to understand it . thus , i do n't waste my time on it .
have n't played it much . downloaded because it was free . tried it for a little while . while not bad , did n't keep my interest .
i like this version of the game and enjoy playing it . much of it is like the television game we all know and love so there was no learning curve and you can just start right in .
i use this app for any notes i get or any stories i write . it has been a very good help to me . a must buy .
this is a fun logic problem . i 've only started playing with it , but i can see that it will be a challenge . there are lots of different puzzles , although some look very similar .
i really enjoyed this game . good story line and the ho were n't so bad . cant wait for the second one . way to go ! ! !
had a difficult time figuring out how to play this game . we play the regular card game all the time , but this was not what i expected .
if you do n't look at the pics , how will you know if it uses facebook or not ? i would give it five stars but people ruined it . ruined it ! ! !
i would rank it 5 once they iron out the bugs . other than that , great graphics , good audio , simple gameplay could n't ask for more !
like most games in this fashion it took some getting used to . feels like angry birds meets cut the rope .
past the first chapter you have to pay to continue . faotd fail , would be a 4 star review without this annoying little fact .
this one is addictive . always trying to beat the evil one . makes you want to keep playing . the animation is nice and makes the game more interactive .
love this game it is so cute and so so fun it is good to send people you know a little card so so cute
wow ! i am getting nothing done because of this game ! ! i wish there were a few more types of levels but all in all , this game is quite fun !
way too easy compared to the other door games but worth the free download if u feel like winning a lot
enjoyed the game . was worth the money & amp ; graphics were good . my only complaint would be that when i needed to use a hint the hint button was small and hard to tap .
you will love this game . for all age 's . someone told me about the this game , said i would like it , they were right .
have n't been able to download the game . i have tried several times to download it . i ca n't get it to download on my tablet .
this game is simple but it is hard to jump over slender girl and it takes a lot of time to upgrade
this game is the worst game ever ! it looked fun but its not ! do n't get this app ! take my word for it .
great for learning and fun and good for little kids this app is great and its free and fun i think it is awesome for the young
actually got this for my 6 yr. grandson when he spent the night and was bored . he loved it would recommend .
okay app . not that many locations , at least in the areas i was interested in . i hope they 're planning to keep adding options .
not a bad game , makes you think a bit on some puzzles . nice way to keep your mind sharp during breaks .
this app helps me draw guns because i 've never been able to draw anything like this . so i would recommend this app if i were you .
this game is absolutely addicting . its really hard for me to put it down . would be even better if it had more puzzles but every game has its ending .
best game ever truly a good game good for kids and the family its fun its cute you got ta love it .
cool game not as easy as i thought it would be . some levels took a lot of effort to find the objects . nice surprise
not a custom app for amazon . been out for a while in the android market . personally i like the game . one of the few that does n't force close .
this is a good app and just saying if you want more free apps , get them at google play ... so this is pretty cool get the app
love the way it repeats anything you say in whatever tone you use . and kids love it . would recommend for all .
not at all impressed with it . love the other games but just did n't like it . there are n't enough steps . would not consider buying it .
only deal with this is after so many games they want you to buy it and if you do n't then you ca n't play it any more
oh , i love playing this game.it helps pass the time and it 's fun , and yes , i would recommend this game
some are easy some are hard but it doesnt progress as you go through the levels nice for a free game
the game is pretty fun . lots of variety in games which is fun . it can take a while to unlock all the games though which is a fun challenge
it is ok but lots of people dont know lots of the logos ! ! blah blah blah blah blah blah etc .
its a very fun and entertaining game . it works very well on my kindle fire and i recommend it to anyone who enjoys dress up games .
fun version of freecell ... works fine on the kindle fire , plays similar to the windows version . if you like freecell you should give this a try .
this game is so much fun for adults and kids and the music and graphics are adorable and it is just down right fun to play
my cousin played this game on her phone so i thought i would try it out and i love it ! its fun and super addicting !
i love this game so much it is not funny at first i thought the game was going to be lame but i was wrong you should by this app
i like this game ! it is very fun to play and is a game for all ages . just a fun game !
i like all of the facebook applications at least i can go and see what is going on or is someone has sent me a message and i can see what is going on .
another game that grabs you and will not let you go till it is through with you ! i like that you can take a guess or turn over another pic for another clue . it 's great .
this game it horrible ! ! ! ! ! there 's not a lot of choices and it 's touchy . i would give it 0 stars if i could .
it was a really awesome game . it a puzzle and adventure game . it was fun and a long game to play that the best game i play
like the ability to & # 34 ; buy help & # 34 ; with the freebie coins , and scramble the letters so you can form more words .
i liked playing it for a while , but to really enjoy the game you have to buy all this extra stuff ... that kind of kills it for me
the game it self was fun but you half to buy each season at 5 dollars a pop . i got through the first season in 30 minutes
other people may like this . i just didnt care for it . it was a hard game and you dont have enough time to see if you change your mind . i wouldnt buy it .
i love this game its safe enough i can let my daughter help me play plus i can enjoy watching the tv show and play the game
not fun at all for a free game . you do n't even get 5 minutes of play and they want you to buy coins .
it 's free but it 's not a good game . do n't get it . the only thing good about it is that it 's free .
it 's from ea so you know it 's going to be bad before you even launch the damn thing but you do it anyway .
okay so the main reason i am rating this app is because i will unlock more drawings ... but i promise you this app is great !
this game is so much fun . some of the puzzles are really hard , but others seem so easy . makes you think .
this is a good game for both kids and adults who feel like kids . if you enjoy the other running games then you will probably enjoy this one too .
i like the idea of picture puzzles . it makes me think a bit differently than other games . keep them coming .
one of my favorite games ! very challenging and a must for those who love word games ! works the brain really well !
i love it . if your a horse lover you will love this game . that is why i rate this game 5 stars .
it 's a really good game for people who like fun challenging games . its challenging but not too hard and very rewarding ! i think you 'll love this game ! ! !
said it would speed up my tablet , it speeds up my tablet . i also like the way it only takes a few moments . would recommend for the price alone .
oh my god this game is absolutely fun and very affordable actually it 's free this is like the game logo quiz but just a tab better
my grandson seemed to like it while visiting over the weekend . i will leave it on my kindle for his use .
this game is pretty fun it could be better but it 's still a good game i like it it 's super addicting
this game is probably the best game i have ever played on my tablet . from looking at the cover i did n't really pull me in , but do n't judge a book by its cover .
this works well on my kindle . it does not give you all the functions that i have from my laptop , but lets me check my facebook , post messages and other .
i chose this rating because it 's an excellent and challenging game ! ! i takes lots of skills to learn and beat everything ! !
i do n't use this app , so i can not properly rate it . so i 'm going to give it three stars and leave it at that .
i could not find anything interesting on this app 's menu . not much selection and what was there was not what i would read .
christmas drop is a good game when you simply want to relax and not think . i enjoyed the lovely music .
this is a good game i like how the background goes with each season but you have to buy certain birds with real money
love this . so easy to navigate , the variety of functions this app has makes it appealing to a wide range of people .
pretty fun app . its a good time waster . but it takes a lot of playing to build up enough points to open more games if you do n't want to buy points .
this app is cool so many cool games in 1 app . my son loves them too . keeps my son busy for hours .
this game rocks . it 's fast paced and has good graphics . i cant stop playing it . cant wait to see what 's next .
i got this just so i could get books recommended to me based on what i have read . there were no books recommended . i uninstalled it almost immediately
it is so easy to see and use . the calculator has large numbers so that it is easier to use for those who have problems using a regular size .
this is the most boring game i have played yet . i kept waiting for the game to start then i realized this is the game . do n't waste your money like i did .
this app works great ! i was able to communicate with my daughter when she was in a spot with no cell service . love it .
just started play pretty fun i guess i hope this helps very very good game for kids and adults bye
i must admit that i usually hate disney 's app games but nemo has been pretty good . my daughter loves it and so do i .
does not give you the answers once your time is up , text twist is a better version of this type of game .
maybe i will like this better if i can figure it out . i need a lot more instruction so i can enjoy it .
i really like this game ... . i just wish i had the entire game instead of only half of it . i love it and i would recommend it to anyone .
this app was not a fit for what i needed it for . there are better apps for the same price on amazon . just find the fit for you .
i like the games a lot at the classic level . however it is not letting me get into the other two levels .
this game is fun and addicting . the only downside is that it takes a long time to complete some of the tasks . other than that , it is a great game .
i like match 3 games but would like if there was a variety of different games . maybe further into games ? hopefully ?
where is the tablet love ? this would be awesome to have . sadly , i went to grab the app on my evo view tablet and got the message that it 's not compatible . why ?
me and my friend were playing with this and all these dots were popping up on the screen with words like die and hello children .
pretty easy , but a great way to spend a few minutes , if you can stop at a few minutes . slightly addictive .
just do n't start playing unless you have a lot of free time . once you get started it is hard to put down .
you have to get this game . i play it so many times a day i ca n't even count . your making a silly mistake if you do n't get this game .
love it ! this keeps me from dying of boredom in so many of my classes . the app is easy to use , and works really well
now this is what i am talking about , a different view of solitaire , that is so much fun to play .
this app is good but it would be so much better if they had the pocket addition for the kindle
nice game and it has lots of challenges . only complaint is the font of the letters . they are hard for kids to recognize . wish there was an option to change this !
this game is horrible it is so terrible i cry every time i play it and no one should get this app because it is worse than a killer
i use this app very often i use it a lot for school work . i think it 's easy and quick to use and i recommend it to other people
this is a cool game . it shows how to escape the titanic and it makes me feel like i 'm really there
takes way too long to download ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! more than thirty minutes but i 'm sure its a fun game . i am thinking about getting the full version .
it 's facebook , exactly what you would expect when you download it . i actually like it better than the ipad 's version myself .
i love this game ! i spend hours playing . the more friends you have to send you gifts and you send them back . you wo n't be disappointed . get the game and start playing .
similar to what others wrote . i uninstalled very quickly after getting it . i would ask for a refund if you paid .
not like one for android , but still good . it is fun easy enough , but not to simple . you can earn coins to buy hints . works great on kindle fire hd 8.9
love this app ! if you like word games you will love this one ! great way to kill time and maybe even learn a few new words !
the game makes you think . fun to play with your friends . i do not like writing reviews because of the word minimum .
i got this one mostly for my granddaughters . they love doing this and you will too . give it a try .
the graphic in this game are get and the sound and winnings are the best . this game takes a good part of my day after work download and enjoy .
this is a fun game . good for family play . children ages 11 and 14 really liked it . recommended for cold days .
really nice game . i love it . very unique and colorful . i definitely recommend this if your looking for a different type of puzzle game .
i love this type of puzzle game so it has been fun to move up the levels . it can get a bit boring but all in all i loved it .
awesome ... ... being a graphic designer this is a great tool to use on my android when i ca n't be near my laptop .
i would give this 0 stars if i could . i downloaded it and tried to play and it would n't let me choose a game , glad it was free .
pretty fun game . something to do when your bored . pretty simple game if your a restaurant person . i enjoy it !
this was a very good game . graphics and story and sound affects were great . well worth the money . you will really enjoy it . hoping for a sequel .
it 's fun and has a lot of different things that pop up . you are always seeing different things on the screen
there are six cards in each match . a low enough number for smaller kids to remember . kept my four year old busy for a while . good app for little girls .
nice graphics . cute theme . basic game . only played few levels so ca n't give full review . kid focused style game . enjoy .
great game love it ! very fun and fast paced . a different bingo for sure i would definitely . recommend it for everyone
we downloaded this to play with the new tablet we got for christmas . i enjoyed it but wish there were more puzzles to choose from .
this is the most challenging game i 've played . it 's so busy that your eyes are moving so quickly before time is up .
this app is good for me . need to learn english . this app help me so much . love app and love english songs !
i like how you can program it very easily and there are n't a lot of different buttons to push . the alarm always wakes me up .
it was sort of good because you play games to earn points and you use those points to get even more games .
i did n't enjoy it as much as i thought i would . i thought it was going to be way more fun than what it ended up being .
it is a nice relaxing game that i like to play to help unwind at the end of the day
this is such a fun game ! i love to play and the challenges are a twist that is added fun , i just wish there could be unlimited games without having to purchase coins .
it is very fun i really enjoy it a lot ! i am on the 5th one it is very addicting .
saved me from making plans in bad weather ! pretty accurate . i look this app up every time i make travel plans . i recommend it .
good puzzle game . has hard , medium , and easy levels for people with different skill level . quotes from famous people after finishing a level are enjoying to read . well worth the asking price .
this game is pretty cool my only wish is it will update the game its had the same little things on it
this game is fun ! it 's challenging , but not to the point of being frustrated . it 's a great way to pass the time .
so much fun i love this game . its harder than i thought it would be . five more words to submit
it does a good job looking for virus and spyware . would tell others about it if asked . worth keeping on kindle
this game is really a challenge . i love to play it . if you like to figure things out and like racing against a clock you will love this game and the graphics .
awesome great fun for all ages . the minions are so so cute i have told all my friends and family
i just love listening to a radio while i am playing a game . there is so many stations to listen to .
this app has all the excitement and fun of being at a las vegas casino without going to the poor farm ! great fun and it runs great on my kindle !
keeps my mind busy when i have nothing else pressing to do . so far i have lost more than i want to .
fun and informative i think i 'm addicted to these games they make you think . i would definitely recommend this and all the games in this series .
we could n't play it at all . would n't even load . i 'm sure it would have been a great game other wise .
this is really neat . you can draw rainbow cause all the colors are there with one swipe of your finger .
quit an easy game but never the less i liked the game a lot . you ask for too many words .
it works like the actual remote . a very good app to have when you ca n't find the real remote control .
without using the hints i have no idea how to move on . not for me to use . i do not like to play a game and keep checking on the answers .
my little girl plays this all the time now . even more om nom nom is what she says when i ask y she likes it .
it 's a relaxing but challenging puzzle game . there are tons of levels and the sound track is beautiful . it 's just a very well made game .
this is organized and easy to use . you cant use your finger of a stylus , but can use the typing feature ... for that it is fantastic ... great app ...
it is a fun game and has many levels that are challenging . i love because it is addicting . have fun ! ! ! !
i love imo . it 's just like it says . no matter what network your friends are on you can chat with them without having to switch over . this is a must have app .
very fun . i can play with my daughter . quirky way to end game . other than that its lots of fun .
did not care for this app , no special reason , just did not like it . did n't like the features or the way it worked . better video poker games out there .
fun had some problems with the focused pictures if pictures was not clear the images did n't come out clear but still fun
i mean its a good game but the controls ruined it for me i mean they were perfect in the first one but everything else is good
the variety of games and the ability to chose the games are great , along with the tutorials for them ! great graphics and easy to play !

this game is very fun and addictive . i play this game all the time and i really love it a lot .
it could be more challenging , it takes up time waiting somewhere . the graphics are good , would i purchase it again , probably ..

i 've only been playing for a few minutes but i can honestly say it is very well made and really fun to play . two thumbs up .
it 's a little long and challenging but really really fun to play and mess around on . this is a must get
the game would not open on my kindle fire . it crashed five times in a row and i uninstalled it . thank goodness i did n't pay anything for it !
great game do n't need to spend real money . unlike most games this one hands out gems ( real money currency ) for completing achievements also when there are updates
this is a really good app . its really nice to be able to open up an app and see how long you can use the internet .
have n't had the opportunity to really explore the functionality of this app but it was certainly easy to get and i assume it will be just as easy to use .
great game for toddlers . my daughter ca n't get enough of the dr. panda series . this is a welcome addition . more please !
i really like word games , and this one is my current favorite . it 's challenging enough to be fun but not so difficult as to be frustrating . i highly recommend .
this game was fun . scenes were clear and music was nice . i would recommend this game to anyone . i would buy it
found this game to be very fun ... challenging but able to solve puzzle game . slightly addictive . and definitely worth a try .
this game is a lot of fun . some clues are easy but some really stump you ! it really makes you think sometimes .
great game to play , need to be able to bet more , win more , so you play longer on the game
nice writing but i could n't erase which makes it difficult to sketch , particularly on the kindle screen . too difficult to keep starting over
game is too hard to win even after a week or more . very frustrating .
i have not yet had an opportunity to play this game , but it is waiting for me on my kindle .
i love cooking ! ! ! ! i would cook all day if i could ! with this i can ! so if you love to cook get it ! ! ! !

what a fun game ! you can do practice games by yourself or compete against friends . and it 's a fun way to keep your mind sharp ! addictive in a good way !
like i said in the title , what kind of a game uses a review in the description ? sounds like they are trying to sell you a crappy toy at an expensive price or something
i played this with my son and finished it in one night . it made us think . there are n't a lot of games that do that .
like the game very much . never heard of it before so i thought i 'd try it . i am glad i did
the controls are very picky . almost every time , i would swipe and she would n't do anything . terrible game , do not get .
like knowing how much of a charge my kindle has at all time . very easy to use . recommend it to all
i believe this game is amazing and it is so adorable ... i love it so much ... hope you like it ! ! ! : ) : ) : )
it & # 34 ; s fine but its just like all the other restaurant games but just hello kitty . little kids may like it .
this is a really well developed game this definitely deserves 5 stars . money is easy to make and the upgrades and armor are amazing and has a great storyline . buying the game was worth it .
works great on my kindle fire . i found it for my daughter and she loves it ! i recommend this app . /
waste of time . i do n't appreciate free games that require you to spend money to be able to get through different levels .
if not the best , or the first , at least the most known . my kids love it and i feel frustrated as they can do more than me ... !
worked great for saving recipes and is fast ! very easy to use and is going to save me tons of time .
the graphics are awsome the levels are awsome and the game is awsome i think its the best game ever
i never saw the point . this is another of those , & # 34 ; okay , i guess it works , but so what ? & # 34 ; apps . and another you can do without .
fun if you like bingo . moves along quickly but not too fast for slow old me . good to keep you alert .
i love it , its so easy to do from anywhere , when you do n't feel like going out you can do your banking from home .
this game is better than the first and has the best graphics , i have seen also best game ever seen .
this game is super hard but addictive and you ca n't stop cause you get the feeling that you need to complete this game but i doubt anyone ever has
it is nice to have easy access to the weather , i am always checking to see what it will be like when i am traveling , and at home .
because it 's a fun game and sometimes you have to actually think how to get past a level . it can get frustrating but try to see it as a challenge .
this is a fun game if you want the time to go by . i played for hours and did n't even realize it .
i liked this game and will play it again soon . it was fairly easy and the scenery was very nice . no time limit which is always a plus .
extremely addictive ... ca n't put it down once you start playing ! must have game for your device to pass time wherever you are
i like having the ability to go online with friends if i do n't want to use my computer . it 's convenient for when travelling .
i 'm enjoying this game and am looking forward to playing it as the time goes by . you can know great challenges without it being too hard .
i am a fan of office jerk and thought this would be as good or better . it is ok at best . i am going to stay with office jerk
this game will definatly give you a challenge . the aiming is like realistic movement . it is difficult that i can say .
good game but hated the part where the lights were out . no crashes . a lot of dialog . would play more like this .
this one will only be fun if you purchase the full app . it is frustrating that you ca n't make the pets well with what they give you for free . deleted after one try .
this one really gets your brain working . usually do the four pics but this one is awesome . would recommend this game to everyone who enjoys a good game . a good one for kids .
i love this game and the options to play many different versions of the game ! the game is very easy to navigate !
very cool . love the idea of following the story through the hidden object game . lots of ways to play and lovely artwork .
okay game fun to play , need better rewards and n more tickets when u sign in . all in all a pretty good game , win some lose some .
this is a great game i think they could make it a little bit better thought i love the game thought
fun way to pass a bit of time . a quick way to find out how little you know about some things and how much you 've forgotten about others .
i 've been using facebook for a few years now on my kindle , phone and home computer so you can obviously see that it 's a favorite of mine .
words are to easily found . i would like the words to be a little harder to find . but overall a game to waste time .
it is okay . i rarely use it though , but it does come in handy when i need to compare prices .
a fun and challenging game for all ages . me , i ran right off the edge and was done . my granddaughter had loads of fun with it and is a bit faster with the reflexes than i .
i ca n't figure out how to play it . i do n't want to play against people that i do n't know . i do n't like social games
great game . i play rpg 's all the time and this is a cute little game for the kindle . i give it a thumbs up
great game to play when you 're just looking for something to do . simple , but makes you think . adds do get a little annoying after a while , though .
fun , easy but makes you think ! it is free so give it a try . good brain game ! it is fun and addictive !
it was fun it takes a lot of space to use this game . by son liked it . but it just gives and error message
i find it addictive and funny . great workout for the brain . even my 70 year old mom likes to play it ! !
i played it a couple of times then uninstalled it . it was a little boring and the graphics are n't very bright .
there is nothing to this game . the graphics are terrible and small . just not what i 'm looking for in a bubble game . there are many others which are free which have much better quality game .
very good app . i got the free one and i had fun but the ads sucked so $ 1.99 is a great deal .
my son like it . and it 's just an ok game for me ... a little slow , but cute and something to do .
my family and i play each other all the time . i am amazed at what i have forgotten . lol i love this game . it 's fun for the whole family .
talk about an addiction ; i ca n't wait to get into a game with friends ; keeps your mind sharp and is fun doing so .
you can not beat the classics . it has plenty of replay value and keeps you entertained . do n't know what else to say .
game is fun to play would be even better if i could connect to facebook on my kindle fire hd .
very good . a variety of logos of easy and hard really gets you thinking . this game keeps you stumped and i really like that in a game .
this another classic from g5 . i have played it before and thought it would be a good game to have on my kindle fire hd .
the games are fun , but there are some technical problems . sometimes when i try to load a game , it just goes back to the menu . )
this game is good . really enjoy playing . wish you could get more free coins but they do have good deals for them .
i think u will like this app its really fun . everyone needs to try it . i give five stars
the entire family loves this one -- kids and adults . within one day we had it on my kindle fire and six cell phones !
this was downloaded for my nephew and he enjoys playing it as often as possible on my tablet . some of my older nieces and nephews play as well .
love this game , my children got me hooked on it . i play it over and over . it is very addicting .
i like the designs they give you . however they only give three designs the rest you have to buy or rate for which is a hassle .
great on kindle fire , no problems . fun way to keep up with friends you enjoy playing with . i have played with both my sisters for a year ! i would recommend this game yo anyone .
this is a great calculator for fractions and regular calculations . i 'm so glad i got it . i would recommend . this to anyone !

i used to play this game when i was younger . now my grandchildren have got me playing it again . yes i would recommend this to any age group . it helps keep the mind young .
i felt this go did not give the player more free tokens . you would have to purchase more to continue to play for more than a few minutes . deleted app from tablet .
i love this place and am always on when i get the chance i really love the games and being able to connect with my friends
this game is fun and challenging . it is fun to ask friends and family and sometimes the answers are funny .
not at the level of angry birds for me but still fun . um , not as difficult to stop playing , that is , it is not addicting .
this game was the worst game you could ever play this game all you do is just slide the picture and your done
great game . i wish u had different tasks to complete and could play against other human players . filler filler filler filler
it gives you 4 choices it is not fun if u download the game u r stupid and u will be mad and hate this game i wish they would of made it much more fun
love the game ! it is very challenging and is rewarding when a new level is reached . it is fun to compete with my friends as well . definitely a good time .
its a time killer . pretty fun for kids and anyone interested in fashion . most likely it will get boring in a few weeks .
love this game . the only down side is its very hard to place in the top three and only slightly easier to get a bingo without having bonuses .
i love this bingo game ! ! ! it 's so user friendly and easy . my daughters love playing this game too . fun fun
not much to it for having to pay for it.i do not really want to do these reviews so i would prefer that you do n't send them . thanks
this game is super fun and challenging but the problem with this game is that there are so many adds ! so your ca n't get past anything until you 've reached the add : (
i do n't watch or listen to enough of this stuff to play this game is the only reason i gave it a 1 star .
this is a fun addictive game . i played it for hours . gets a little harder with each level . highly recommend .
i decided it was not worth the trouble after working with it for a little while . i found it more complicated than it needed to be .
fun to play . not limited like most free games . it 's fun to keep trying to top my scores after unlocking all the levels .
this is really an addictive game , you can play for hours without stopping . once again , my husband loves this one !
just okay ! nothing special here ! and not what i thought it would be or as good as i thought it would be !
this game is freaking sweet ! ! i play it on the kindle fire and it responds really nicely , and on top of that ... ... its free ! ! ! ! ! i highly recommend it .
this game is a nice little diversion . it 's easy to learn and fun to play . i like to play it on coffee breaks or on the bus .
it 's an okay game but really could n't get into it . i play it when i 'm not playing one of the others !
they have a lot , but there could be more words , the navigation in the program could be made easier , but that may be just the kindle .
everyone knows this by now , but this is a very fun , relaxing and addictive game . definitely recommend for someone who likes relaxing yet strategic games .
this games is really good u should get it . the best game ever its so fun and it has more than the other temple . run
once you get th hang of it , it 's actually pretty fun . i 'm glad i downloaded it , i suggest it ! : )
i got addicted to it them upgraded my phone and did not reload it because of the time it wasted .
this makes me laugh . good for keeping your brain sharp . it 's unique , fun , and funny . sometimes it 's fun to actually let them die !
great free game its really easy to control everything unlike some games on a tablet ... plenty of weapons and u do n't have to spend real money to beat the game !
this was n't fun for me or my kids . it was hard to use and seemed really pointless . not worth the money .
i absolutely love this game . love to play hidden picture games and this is a good one . lots of fun !
i enjoy playing with my friend and family . it is easy enough for anyone to play . love the changes you can make to your character
i really enjoy this game . it 's easy to use and a nice time waster game . only complaint is that you have to have a wifi connection to play .
i thought it was a fun game and all but i thought it was kind of annoying . also they only give u 12 levels .
it is a great app will read to you and has lots of other stuff greatest app ever get you will not regret
this is a great app for checking accounts on your kindle on the road or just on the go or where ever
i love to play solitare games . this selection is nice with all the different games . instructions included . you should try it .

good game to keep you guessing . throughout all the years . even if you do n't know you can see things from the past and the present . fun game
this game is fun , and something to challenge your eye coordination . try the game and solve the mystery items that are involved .
this product makes it possible for me to enjoy my music even more wen i read or work . easy to adjust to taste .
it 's just like the version on my laptop . it 's great . i play it everyday on my break and when i bored . it 's a good he to help pass the time .
this is a terrific game i highly recommend it ! ! ! get this game now you will have so much fun ! ! ! hope you are able to get it !
great life and funny quotes and love that u can save the pic quotes to your email or facebook to send to friends : )
uno is a great card game and to have an app for my kindle is even better ! the app is great it 's colorful fun and exciting !
this game was super fun and it kept me entertained . love the g5 games and i ca n't wait for more !
everything on it works well except the pictures take a long time to load . if someone updates there profile picture this app will often show there old profile pic as well .
i really like this game its fun . helps pass time and is n't boring because its a puzzle it has current and older songs making it fun for everyone
it was n't such a bad game when i first downloaded it , but after the update now you have to pay with real money for upgrades . not worth it . i deleted it after 5 minutes .
the game is great . it keeps my five year old busy . i would recommend this game to others to play .
my aunt and cuz told me about it and now i 'm addicted . it does need to work on ads but other than that its amazing and fun for every age : o )
another game to help your memory of bible text and facts . not a bad game but some others are more challenging .
this game is top of the line . the graphics are amazing . its easy to play but it has its challenges . i recommend this app for anybody who has a kindle fire .
it is just for random if you want to guess your mood idk a mood ring works better . it was not the quality i expect
this is a good game for all ages ! i think you should try . its worth it ! i love all ages games to ! and i 'm 9 !
this app works very well - simple clean look to it as well . the search bar makes it easy to find what you are looking for .
so interesting and fun . love the puzzle feature trying to get through the maze and go to the next level .
i think it is awesome because you can listen to songs you have never even heard of there is just one thing there is too many ads but i still love this app
very different form the other hidden object apps . not as good or fun . you might like it and it is free .
this game lets you no all sort of restaurants and let 's you know your signs for the restaurant it helps in all sorts of ways .
it 's straight forward and easy to use , no photos to use up space . plus , it has great radar . a good app to have .
this is so far my favorite of the angry birds games . it is so much fun . the puzzles are very interesting and some very fun new & # 34 ; bird & # 34 ; types .
i love to hear the music as you try to see how fast you can go to beat your last time .
this is a regular logo game . it would have been good if they had shown the logo when it is solved . there ia a small check mark only .
i like this because it is n't extremely challanging and it is worth having if you just like to relax and play a game .
this game is very fun and very addictive . it was easy to figure out how to play and with the amount of puzzles its a great way to pass the time
out of the many horrible games in the world this is one of them ! it looks fun at first but it is very boring and lame so unless you like games like that do n't get this app
give it a 3 out of 5 because the hints are very vague and cost too much . worth the free download
i like the app , but it took forever to find the right one to download . i am perfectly happy to continue reading from my paper subscription .
good puzzles ; hidden objects ; good storyline . ca n't wait for the next one to come out . it could have been a little more difficult so that it was more challenging . but still fun .
i love this app ! i do n't have a phone , only a kindle fire , but magic jack is exactly the same as a phone ! the sound is so great , too .
this is a cute little learning game . the beginning is a little confusing but once you get the hang of it its fun . i recommend this game for all ages .
things are hidden very well . when the image is shown its a little tougher , that 's why i like to play without a clock timing me
good game to pass time with . wish there were more choices in each section . but other than that a good game !
in my opinion this game was pretty boring . you can download it if you do n't believe me , but its pretty lame
it is a horrible game . do n't download this . i hate this game . it is a waste of time . deserves zero .
love being able to see the weather on the go and for traveling . love being able to check weather when planning to travel .
lots of fun to play , may be a bit expensive , but definitely worth the price . tons of levels to play .
the nice thing about this is you can use different puzzle piece sizes so the same puzzle is different each time by increasing the number of pieces .
this game is so cool and i share this with my cousin and sister they love it so much they jump on it ever since i had this game
addictive , hate to put it down . fun game . challenging enough but not too much to get frustrated . looking forward to more .
was able to download but was not very engaging . played for about five minutes then removed from my kindle fire .
do n't know ) yet key word yet lol seems pretty cool do n't know what to do but is good so be cool
was fun at first . then i got stuck . it forces you to play the same level over and over again . and whats with the spyware ? its a game , not a virus .
i have an idea for another & quot ; story & quot ; . a kingdom story . you could build your own kingdom and complete quests to expand it . cool right ?
has some real good puzzles some that where so so . at the price for $ 1.99 good deal for the buy
this is a fun game but i think there should be more options for the rooms and i do n't know how to update or get a dungeon
searching anything whatever i want it will be seen on the internet silk on kindle fire but i feel like do n't wan na use it
i love the graphics and fast pace of this game . i had never played it on facebook but now i enjoy diamond dash as much ad candy crush saga .
great games offer a little of everything to challenge your mind . not sure which of the challenges i like the best . they vary the type to keep it from becoming too repetitive or boring .
lets me me use my twitter account on my kindle : ) works great ! so yea you have to have so many words to submit a review !
i love this game its so much fun i played it on my sisters nook tablet and they did n't have the same one on the kindle fire but i do n't care i love this game
i ca n't put it down once i start i love the one movement mode i could play forever if i would n't reach the top would recommend this game to others
so fun just like the tv show . fun , entertaining and a great way to fill time . would recommend this game for anyone who enjoyed the tv show .
this app would n't download . kept giving a load error every time i tried .
fun little game to pass the time away . so far works great . love playing it . looks pretty kid friendly as well .
just like on my phone except easier to see because of the kindle being larger . would recommend this to others .
i can see the numbers and playing multiple cards is so easy . this is the one game that i do n't mind purchasing more chips .
fun ! and not competitive ! better than bingo blitz in that way ! it 's nice to just have fun ! who made this game ?
i have been playing the game for awhile and ca n't put it down . there are lots of chances to win .
this is a fun and exciting game . it took me awhile to decide if i wanted to download this game , but now i 'm glad i did .
not what i expected . it always said i was happy and that was n't the case . there needs to be more of a variety
this is the real temple run and really works awesome ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
i found it confusing to try to play this game on my kindle fire . therefore i have decided to delete it ...
i am using it on a kindle and not having any problems at all . i like the variety of puzzles within the puzzle . highly recommend . : )
love the weather , and radar and how the app is set up ... it is so much better then weather channel 's app
it is a nice app , quite fun and addictive . as usual you have to pay to get more coins for hints like every guessing game .
great series of games with different things to do in every title released . gives my child an excuse to & # 34 ; ask nicely & # 34 ; for my tablet lol !
this is a fun little game . you run out of balls to quick but if you just want a game that takes a minute to play than this is perfect
finally able to enjoy pinterest in an easy to navigate app ! works great on my kf and i love the updates . pin all the things ! !
love this game very fun to play and share with the family . i enjoy the game sounds makes you very happy ! ... .
fun game i am already stuck but my friends enjoy helping me out . the last few games i played like this were way to easy
you have to buy to much of the stuff in this game or the game will be kinds difficult . but other than that this is a pretty good game
this is a great workout . you are never to young to work out , and this is okay for that . i 'm 12 and i can use this !
i love this game so much . i play this more than minecraft pocket edition . i deleted a lot of old games .
down load works great , enjoy watching the shows . there is always something diffrent , very informative . the boys love it just as much as i do
good app but not great just needs more detail in the forecasts . a travel weather info option would be nice also .
good game but i wish they would 've given me more coins to start with . i m stuck at level 15 and will not buy coins so i guess i 'm done .
this is great puzzle to make you think with instant feed back . thanks for having it for the kindle fire .
this is a awesome game for all ages . many will enjoy this awesome game . i hope you like it as much as i do ! : )
i have waited for this to come out on the kindle . so much easier to see then it was on my phone .
again they hit the nail on the head ! this is an amazing platform for a game style . the game is wonderful .
love this game , keeps me busy while travelling with friends or family members . awesome game to play alone ! it 's great !
my grandchildren love this it , it 's a great way to get young children use to a tablet . therefore they will learn to understand how to use it in a fun way of doing so
awesome app ! this is sooo much more fun than temple run or subway surfers ! nice job gameloft ! i love the cute characters and the awesome places and the event update is pretty cool !
great app for i phone and kindle ! easy to use and no glitches so far ! love it ! would recommend it .
interesting puzzle game . there is only one way to solve the puzzles . it 's fun at first , but can quickly get frustrating . i like puzzles , but this got old fast .
this game is greater this game is good you should n't hesitate to get it it is very good but you have to rate it to get all bird colors .
i can not change the look of the tiles so that i can feel comfortable playing this game . the background also can not be changed .
it works well . it works very fast and has n't let me down to date . i recommend this free download for a quick clean up of your cache .
app was a lot of fun . some of the levels make you work at it but overall piece of cake . app was really short though
i 've been looking for a game with a variety of puzzles that is challenging and fun . this is it and you do n't have to spend money to play if you do n't want to .
fast learning curve . i could not put it down for way to long did not become boring or repetitive . great game fun and well done .
this is fun and it makes me laugh . just be careful of that theme song though . once you get it in your head , you ca n't get rid of it .
this little app gives you an excellent stop watch with multiple lap times as well as a basic stop timer functionality . very friendly interface and super functional !
this is the best game i ever played . u need to get it now ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! it is so easy to play .
so glad that amazon finally got this app . love this game . very addictive . plays really well on the kindle fire . no glitches so far .
i have had pou for 2 weeks or so , and i cant wait till i can afford some outfits for her though ...
temple run is one of my favorite games because you jump run and turn . you collect coins and buy stuff
fast moving game that holds your attention . plenty of wins and free chips . your friends can receive and send gifts of chips and free spins .
it was very easy to follow ! had a great time . once you got started , you did n't want to stop till it was done .
this is a pointless but fun ap particularly for kids - which i am not . makes a decent , if battery wasting , flashlight !
i find the new updates has made it more enjoyable and it gives better credits . worth giving a try . nothing to loose only better payouts to achieve .
hands down my absolute favorite site .it 's the 1st place i go to when i turn on my kindle in the morning ! ! !
not sure about this game for me . it seems just ok. it take to much time to go between games . but grandson loves it : )
like the game got to level 21 before needed help did n't know some words but love to learn so give it a try
this app is really fun and you can easily find yourself playing it over and over ! it 's hard to stop even to rate the app !
i love this app i was in the app store and saw it my sister said i should buy it . so i did ( just for her ) now its my favorite app ! ! !
it 's alright gets really boring really fast only reason for keeping it is for my niece who 's almost two years old
so much fun , gives you plenty of tokens to keep playing ; i return to this game most often . thanks for offering a great game .
i love this game ! it 's better than the real games ! this is the perfect distraction for those boring long wait times we all experience .
sometimes i ca n't figure out what one of the pictures have to do with the word . i used to wait but now i go with three .
so much fun ! ! just like a real pinball machine but on my kindle ! ! ! could spend hours just playing it ! ! worth the time to install ! thanks !
the other games were awesome so i 'm excited for this one . i 'm awesome cause i 'm the third person to write a review
what makes this bingo so exciting is you do n't have to wait for each ball , you control the pace of the numbers being called . the more bingos you get the more rewards you earn .
i enjoyed this very much and will start again soon . had to put the kindle down for a while so i could do some work !
this is such a fun game . keeps you playing & passing the time . best ive ever played . its free and give it a try .
& hearts ; this app is a lot of fun ! i have spent hours playing with this and it has n't gotten old yet . great for all ages !
played on kindle fire . excellent graphics , great story line . wish it was longer , but for 99 & cent ; you ca n't beat it .
just completed floor nine to realize that was the last floor ! i was really enjoying playing this game and really hope they are working on more floors !
it did not work on my kindle fire hd as the alarm was too soft to be heard otherwise it is & # 34 ; fine & # 34 ; .
i liked it for the moment but it was very slow . i could n't deal with it so i uninstalled it sorry .
did n't like the game , was n't what i expected when i downloaded it and i deleted this game from my kindle .
fun game . gets your brain in right brain so lose track of time . goes from easy to hard to easy etc . tricky at times too . does n't cost to skip which is nice .
i was n't impressed with this app . i was bored and not very challenging . still looking for a challenging bubble game .
i bought this app months ago , and love it . it makes saving websites to read in bed a breeze , and formats them to make them easier to read .
looked like it would be fun to play but i could not get it to play for more than a minute
i think this is really fun . there are a few inappropriate things but other than that it is awesome there are glitches , some funny , some not . like sometimes that walk through another .
it starts out fairly easy and keeps you moving forward then it takes a turn for the worst . not easy to move to the next level , so you quickly lose interest of playing this game .
this game is really fun but it is pretty hard to get money on the game please make it so we can get more money
i am still learning to play this game , but it is fun nonetheless . also you ca n't beat a free game that keeps you entertained .
i like the sound effects with each different animal . it is just as entertaining as the original mahjong with a new little twist .
great game works great on my kindle fire has never crashed once definitely worth 99 cents buy it now it 's awesome
hours of fun i love this app . we play at least once a day . the kids love it too .
this is one of the best game i have ever playing before it teaches u how to take care of something
make you buy too much stuff that you do n't need and way too many battles that do n't help you at all
i like this game . my son loves to play it as well . i also like the different versions . i have this game on my iphone as well .
it 's so cute . i love playing it and so do the kids i baby sit . he 's fun to listen to . and fun to watch grow
this is a very average game with little chance to customize deck or deals . do n't look for any real challenges in this offering .
lots of fun ... have n't tried everything yet , but lots of choices . would definitely recommend to anyone who likes to play mahjong .
i use a kindle fire . i have tried again and again to connect to facebook as well as the apps very own store and anytime i click a non game play button the entire game freezes then crashes .
i love word games and this is fun and different . its a nice change of pace and the game has no permissions .
it is challenging ! ! ! have tried it and the time limits still get me . i 'll keep trying it and see how it goes .
i am really enjoying this app , glad i downloaded it ! it works parts of the brain you may not use in normal day to day life .
it works well with my kindle fire . i can go on real quick , look at the headlines , and go on to other things
easy to use . makes posting easy and fast . i can check my account from my kindle now not just at home .
it 's okay , my 5 yr old says he likes it . the boys say that it 's too hard when you get to level 2
i downloaded this app to entertain myself & amp ; my daughter . it kept saying i messed up 3 notes into each song . got so frustrating i 'm uninstalling .
at first i thought this was going to be a boring game . as i continued to play it got better and better . now i cant wait to get back to it .
i enjoy the game , but i would like it a lot more if i was able to skip one if i do not know it . it is very frustrating being stuck and unable to go forward .
a very enjoyable game . i definitely recommend it . it is very relaxing and easy without being too easy . give it a try .
i really like bakery story but this game is certainly giving it some competition ! thank you again teamlava ! amazon i have nothing else to say ... ...
love this game can not get enough of it . it 's the best game ever , to me once you try . you will get hooked . : )
about the whole update thing , i waited a day or two and the update was there . the fan s really cool and people should wait before they complain about their being no update .
the best game ever ! ! ! ! great ! ! ! ! worth $ $ $ you should get it i turned even the tv off crazy right crazy just crazy
i like it so far ... wish it did n't take so many coins to open up other levels . or that i could accumulate the coins faster ...
i love this app because i love puzzles also the pics are great and its something the whole family can enjoy
i love this game so much it is my favorite app in my app slide deserves a solid 5 stars
a great way to waste away a few minutes or a few hours . zombies ... how could you possibly go wrong with zombies ? worth playing .
i play this game almost all day ! ! ! ! ! the only thing thing that i would add is probably a double tap kind of thing . other wise it 's an amazing game ! ! !
this game is great i really like hidden object games and if you do to you will really like this one
i was promised free amazon coins . i ever got them . the download is huge . it took forever . and the game was quite boring
this game took me 3 hour to complete when i was playing it in the car . fun easy to understand and really it could kinda be a two player game . i would recommend it to anybody .
kind of hard to get used to some of the items are hard to find . i find it nice that the hints are n't limited .
this is the new game to get addicted to ! runs great on the kindle fire . i recommend everyone try this one out .
both of my kids like to play with this application they love it and they have fun with the pictures and painting it
this game is sweet and its for free you should get it.it has easy movies as long as you watched or heard about them .
game asks the same questions over and over , there is no challenge , no steps to get harder questions . just all out boring .
this is a game that is fun and can become addictive . i have finally reached a level that is extremely challenging to get through .
great follow up from first game and graphics much improved . areas of game are challenging and mini games too : )
sometimes it is difficult to see what level a tile is on to see if it is available for use .
this game is a cool game ive been trying 2 look 4 it but it did not respond so now i have it awesome game u should get it .
what 's to say about solitaire . i have another version that i like better . i do n't know how to play anything but plain ole solitaire
not one of my favorite , sometimes it get alittle boring but i still do play it from time to time . this is one that i would n't recommend .
you could play this game for hours and hours . it is a lot of fun i love it . you should buy it .
fix this app right away or i will cancel my netflix subscription together other 2 million kindle fire owners . cant watch anything .
i do n't like that i can only see few things on my news feed . it only shows like 5 stories and that 's it ! and there is no way i can check the other ones
this is a awesome game best graphics ever seen in a mobile video game if you have a android or iphone download now 5stars ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
what is the difference between this one and the original letters from nowhere because i think the only thing g5 is trying to do is get people to spend another 3 dollars on a game people already bought
this game requires some imagination and concentration . the doors are interesting and varied . it is an overall fun game for everyone .
it is mind boggling , and at the same time very fun and addicting ! it is not very easy which makes it fun
this game is rated a 5 out of 5 stars in my book . i love it . the more you do in this game the more you get back out of it . the collections part is fun to
this is a awesome game when they say when pigs fly they mean it in this game . you should get it
this is a great time passer game . it 's a matching game like bejeweled that lets you advance in levels . i like that it 's seems never ending .
it has great quality and definitely keeps u busy : ) so i ur in the mood for a puzzle making mind timing game flow free is the one for you !
i was getting kind of bored and figured i 'd check the game out . it 's actually kind of fun and i like the fact that it keeps me entertained when i have nothing to do .
i have tried several time to get this to work and it will not even let me sign in on my phone to see my books
i thought this game might be boring but since it was free i decided to try it and i 'm now addicted to this game ! great graphics , lots of levels ! lg optimus
perfect app for people who love drawing and collect and love guns . learn how to draw your favorite weapon in easy to learn steps
it 's awesome . i could n't get flappy bird on my kindle so this was the perfect alternative . definitely deserves five stars ! ! ! !
i love every thing about all the papi games from the first all the way to right now i think that this game was very entertaining .
this is the best game i have gotten on my kindle by far . i got it when it was 1 $ best money spent .
there are only limited puzzles available for free - but what do you expect for free , right ? the ones that were available were ok .
silly sounds and noises . graphics too cartoon like . childish . no multi player version . the game is not that great honestly . sorry .
this site has so many great ideas and things to do ! ! ! i have many friends sending me great ideas .
love this game it 's so fun . i love old times and old things love the look of this game . enjoy finding out what 's next .
this app is the boom i love and when i make my cats look funny on here he will sit on my lap and watch i recommend it but there is not that much free but yea download it

i am a sudoku nut . this is an easy to use version , and fun too . i definitely recommend this game .
runs ok on the htc evo but just not for me . graphics are ok very comic book style . sound fits the game play .
i played it on my iphone first and was thrilled to find it as a free kindle app ... bonus coins hourly ... and new locations coming all the time . great download .
i had this twice already and i thought how it will be better well i thought wrong . when i tried to create one it kept on saying sorry !
straightforward time waster . no problems . pictures are small on by droid razr m but ok when clicked . may get repetitive after a while .
i love puzzle games and i really loved doors and rooms one so i 'm hoping the one will be as good i do n't know because i 've only finished a few levels so far
i do like this game and think it is easy . i like trying to figure all of this stuff out , but do n't want to get too involved .
i do n't think it is a bad game , but i limit the type of games i want them playing and constantly having shooting as a theme is n't my idea of a good day .
the game is good . keeps my son occupied for hours . definately recommend for someone downloading this for their child . you ca n't go wrong with sonic !

okay of a game but i do n't really care for it went a little slow and i do n't really care
kept getting the same message over and over , not able to connect to network . there was nothing wrong with the network , just the program .
i 'll have to give it a little more play time before i can really say for sure ... but so far it 's a cute app .
i play this game at least once a day and i never get sick of it . it 's a really fun game . : d
kindle fire - the app works fine enough but gets boring too fast & did n't hold my attention . i played 1 level & removed it .
so fun i love it so much i have been so happy that i ca n't hate it oh i love you big fish thank you so much
i did not realize that this was not like the real arcade game . i used to play this game on n actual game console . so for what it is , the game is a good one .
a different version of solitaire , much like playing with two players instead of one . if you have the time this version can be the challenge
i spend so much time playing this . i use this app more than any other thing on my kindle . it is so fun !
for cribbage players it 's a fun game to pass the time . have n't gone online with it , but i enjoy the game .

needed to be able to watch areas i travel . excellent for my needs . it 's quick and gives enough info for my use
i play this once in a while when i am bored . however , this is not the game i would pick up everyday .
me and my mom play the game when were bored ! ! ! this game is totally worth it ! ! ! you can also play nonlinear with random people .
this is the most boring game i ever had played never get this game ever . it also runs out your battery so do n't get this stupid game ! ! ! ! no wonder its free !
i 've never played flappy birds before but i think that this is probably the exact thing its very very fun
this is a decent game . have n't played it in a while since i got it so it obviously did n't hold my attention super great .
good to get a quick review of what the current news of the day is . able to read the items that interest me and not the ones i am not interested in .
minecraft is the best game in history . if u like minecraft and looking for more minecraft related games , try survival craft
this game is fun especially when hanging out with friends . some of the pictures do n't make any sense but can be figured out with one clue .
my 1 year old loves it . it is interactive and keeps his attention through the story . great read along . try it out .
this game has potential but my games were not being saved when i was done playing for the time being .
i 'm not a pizza fan , but this is a really cool game . the only flaw is in app purchasing . i just hate that
do not get this game it is very stupid and boring , it is also very slow , remember do n't get it is is stupid and not fun
follow the instructions if you are little kids who knows they could spend money on this app and they could write a review .
it is so cool i wish i could play on it all day and the pics are so funny and if i were u i would say something
for me this app wont load . i do not know if anyone else has had this problem ? in my opinion a good app should run well for any device .
great game . i have n't played in a while , but when i do , it is great . the words are great choices .
i kept going back to this game it was so much fun , it gave me the option to try again when i wanted to improve my score .
i love this game but the fact that you have to pay about a dollar more for updates kinda stinks other than that its absolutely amazing
useful , intuitive , easy to use , cross platform , web and computer based allowing sync between equipment . fire version does not seem as easy as computer version , but is reliable and high quality .
my wife uses this for background noises to help her fall asleep , does the job well and she likes the selection of sounds .
listen to almost any station you want or make your own radio station to listen to . i use it when my radio does n't work or if i 'm at school .
fun word puzzle that makes you think and not in just one way . gives you a chance to learn as well when it comes to vocabulary .
this is a poorly put together page . you have to jump around to find the news and it 's a bad layout .
i got this for my grandson just like all the other games . he really likes them all . i am happy with every game i have downloaded for him .
it did just the opposite for me . i like peace and quite or nice soothing music but this was talking and i hated it . sorry just me .
i was browsing around when i found this game app . it looked like my style , so i went for it . pretty cool so far . i think my daughter will totally like this .
i play this every night to wind down from my hard day at work , it 's very relaxing yet very challenging .
if you like adventure hidden object games with lots of puzzles you will find this both interesting and challenging . hard to put it down . love g5 games . state of the art . well worth the money .
this was gotten by mistake , and i do not like guns i tried to play it but i hate a game like this
i enjoy playing bingo and on here i can do it and not use my real money . i enjoy it .
look the people who gave it less then 5 you are dumb and are not cool but the others that gave it 5 are real cool
easy to play , graphics are nice on the eyes . just like a real game and highly addictive . would definitely recommend this game .
i really enjoy these games . i like all the different locations that make the game more interesting . keep the g5 games coming .
there is just enough of a challenge in these games to make them fun too . keep up the great work . thank you .
i like this better than the other casino games . the slot is loose and rewards easily . only small issue is the screen seems to stick on play bonus .
it 's really entertaining , easy to play . lots of different types of games to play . just wish it had more options .
fun game but for an old guy with his first android it can be a little hard to use for a first time user and the price point overall a fun game .
must not have liked this one very much . i do not remember having it and/or i did not keep it .
this game is addictive . great fun to play . i am using a kindle fire hd 8.9 and the graphics are good . simple to play .
the app would let me on but would n't do anything ! i 'm so angry and frustrated with this app ! fix it or i will definitely delete it !
i really love this app . i hopefully do n't need to use it right now , but it will come in handy one day when i might need to look for another job .
its a good game if you like facebook type games but i just do n't care for the layout or playing style . i just do n't find it very fun .
so cute so fun and so addictive ! you have got to get it . i loved it so so so much ! ! !
fun game . enjoyed . it a lot . the price is right so you ca n't go wrong . go for it and have some fun .
this game is ok for a little while but not for long . even my son , who loves to play games on my phone , did not play this for long .
this app is more fun than the one on facebook . you get the things you need so you can p in a reasonable amount of time . )
this is the best app to use if u need light to help u see this app is sick this is a must get app
just the thing to relax with . i hope to find more like this . simple and quiet . the story seems to be pure fantasy but i could share this with any one .
unable to play because a screen pops up to upgrade . when i clicked on it i am told i already have it . very annoying .
love this game ! gives me something to do when i 'm bored that is actually working my mind . hope they keep making levels to play !
this is a really fun game but i really wish they had more hints because some levels are really hard ! ! !
pic mix is a really fun game because you can ask anyone in your family to help you if you do n't now the answer .
i liked this app is was fun to find the objects in the picture if you like this type i would download it .
i enjoy this game . challenging and a little different . colorful and more than your average bubble game . i recommend this game . playing on the kindle fire .
wish you could play longer without having to rely on real money to continue . but the live play online is fun and the interface is intuitive enough .
this is a very fun game , and easy to play . i love the kindle edition , and play it often . i would definitely recommend this game to those who enjoy this type of game .
i use to play this game all the time when i was younger . its nice to see some of the old games again keeps me feeling young .
it 's a good game , and easily entertains my children when need be . besides you just ca n't beat a free game : )
i found this game dull and boring . i like games that require either thinking or control skills and this seemed to offer neither .
i read all the food reviews , thinking this game would be good . i was wrong because i ca n't even log in .
i like the size of the remote control , i also enjoying seeing the channel selections . this a very useful app .
i love having it all together and not having to carry so many books . it 's fabulous . you should get it id you do n't have it .
this game is now one of my favorite to play even when i 'm bored . so you should buy this fun game .
this game is really cool but i wish they could of added more guns . but over all this app is pretty awesome .
i have tried several calculator apps on my phone , but i like this one the best . has many functions , but if you are doing just simple math applications it allows you to do them quite easily .
awesome , easy , makes you feel smart . also , great relaxing music to go along with it . the only problem is that you cant put it down !
this game is soooooo cool you get to dress up . a press and do a make up cool and hair
unlike another light app i tried , this one actually does what it says and does it every time . very handy at night .
good game nice little story . graphics are great and works well on kindle fire . longer then most games in this genre .
the game is easy to access and with different levels of play can be as easy or as challenging as you prefer .

this game is awesome it 's so fun but i ca n't even get passed the first level it is so amazing
this game is okay but so many of the objects are very small and hard to see . i do like the variety of screens though .
it seems easy at first then it starts to get challenging as you work further into the game ... its fun and help time pass by .

once you get the controls down , it 's a very easy game . plus it is addicting ! i recommend this game for people who like shooting games .
i like this game because it make me think and i spend lots of hours of entertainment . i will recommended to all my friends .
i really enjoy doing the logo games but find myself using a lot of hints because they are quite hard .
i thought this game would be fun but it just glitches out all the time so it sucked every time i played
i like this kindle version way better than the computer version because its so much easier to touch the screen rather than use the mouse .
i am bout to delete the app cuz i never play it cuz it does n't do me well and i do n't get it

this is a fun game to play . i think it is good for people to work their brain . great game
do n't know right now ... ... ... ... . do n't know ... ... ... ... how to know later about this game so i come back and let you know
you do n't ever win . it is a slow game , there are no instructions on how to play . no clear way to see pay outs .
just do n't like these type of games . i thought it was going to be different . you may like it but i just do n't
i love this site . it is amazing how many times i can go there and find help in my daily walk with god . love the reading plans . and being able to use different versions .

it is a bad app it 's really slow you get a really small area do n't get it no doors there is only 5 items .
this game is a blast to play . especially if you like puzzles where you need to select or move items to win .
my daughter loves this lil dragon . she thinks its like having a pet . great app guys . i hope it continues . to be awesome .
if you enjoy bowling , this is the next best thing to being at a real bowling alley . the sound effects also add to the fun of playing .

love the game just need more boards to play . cause ones u beat them it done . fun for all the family
really fun game . easy to play and interesting idea . i only wish it were longer , too bad there are only ten levels . add more levels !
.great game . if you like hidden items . i few twist from other hidden games i 've played . i would recommend it .
it wo n't work on my kindle hdx , so have n't even been able to try . might have been a really good game if it would load .
the only complaint i have is that i could not increase the size of the hidden object portion . will purchase the sequel .
better than flappy birds ! but i 'm not as good at it as flappy birds . other wise the game is really fun .
i think it would be awesome to play the game because my friend has it and she likes to play it .
i thought that this game offered very little in instructions on how to play . it was not at all what i was expecting when i purchased it .
i have n't played it yet . its still downloading ... but i give it five stars cause u guys said it was good . i hope it worth it cause is taking forever !

please change the background it is hard to see the tiles but a good game cant play long at a time
my 16 month old son loves this . there is n't much to it , but it keeps him entertained . and it 's only .99 .
so fun you should get it . it teaches you how to take care of something or one . i love it . i already have 5 sims

i love it is is a fun and entertaining game : - ) it 's so much fun ... i just started but plan on getting the full version
all the libii salon games are really fun . they are all pretty much the same , but all of them are different in different ways . i think there cool .

i have no clue what this game is about . it look like a good game . i do n't have anything to download it onto .

been using es file manager for quite a while - my last three smartphone - and could n't get along with out it . great app ! ! !
it 's just a calculator , but its nice application for kindle to have on hand when you need it . i love it !
this game has so many interesting levels . and each one becomes slightly more difficult than the last . i enjoy a challenge and if you do too this game is definitely worth trying .
i really like this game . fun to play . enjoy the concept . of all the slots my favorite . so would recommend it .
i think this game is quite entertaining . it keeps me guessing all the time . really great to pass the time with also .

no matter how much your reviews are good it does n't even let me download i can not play please fix it please .
i liked this game but it kept locking up and i would have to restart it and reload it . now it is just locked . waste of money .
i love this game ! the song that plays during the credits is especially catching ! for an added challenge , try to complete all the achievements !
love this app ... taught myself to play cribbage on it ! it is easy to navigate , never crashes on my droid and the new achievements are cool .
i play a lot of these ho games . this is a great one . mini puzzles could be improved but everything else was way above average . length on game is very good too .
the game is addictive indeed . just be patient if you run out . otherwise , buy coins . i recommend using the game .
this is a great app to have to make you laugh , you should really get it some stories are inappropriate but great and funny this app is awsome .

first of all i think is a really cute and adorable game to play i have not try it yet but i will and i think i will really like it
played the game for three days and really enjoyed it . the quests were great without being impossible to solve . fun game .
loving the amount of levels and sections . the graphics are great . this is visually and mentally fun . i 'm loving the various themes .
if you want the same stuff that is on here then just go to google and it would be easier then waiting !
this app is great ! ! it is great for anywhere ... . anytime ... when i want to watch something boom ! i can get out this app to watch it..
even though it downloaded fine , i could not get this app to open on my kindle , i had to uninstall it .
i find myself playing this until all i can see is dots ! i didnt think i would like it , but i really do !
i have a kindle fire an it would not work . the graphics were blurry an the noise was awful . deleted immediately .
this is an awesome game ! i found it while i was looking for something to do and now i am addicted ti this little game .

i am so glad this was an app of the day i like the advance search you have so many options i do n't know birds names and it was helpful
this is a great app for my family . we have fun watching the videos and listening to the music . i would certainly recommend this app for any family .
does n't run like it should ! only a few levels free . tried to download full version still would n't give me full version
love this app and my almost 3 year old can use to really good to see the videos that she want so to see .
this game is great for kids of all ages especially the older ones who say they have nothing to do . my kids and i enjoy this game a lot .
i found it to be a very challenging and fun game . some of the rooms are harder than others . i enjoyed it very much .
enjoyed this game a great deal . smooth play , good story , good hidden objects . no complaints , and yet again i feel i got more than my money 's worth on this one .

it gets a little boring at times . but , it 's fun to play sometimes . if you 're looking for a fast playing game , this is not the one to get .
this was the first game i put on the machine . i enjoyed playing and it took me a while to get through it . i went to another game like it but have n't like it at all .
i just found it really boring . not much to do , it was simple , boring , too simple , too boring . not challenging .
its boring and stupid . i hate it wat r th coins 4 and its hard 2 get past well far into th game
this game is okay . but it is not very user friendly . it could used better directions once you figure it out it is fun to play
if you are like me and like guess the product or brand you will like this one too ! ! ! a very fun game ! ! !
its . good but i rate it five stars because its good when it has more colors i will be very pleased .

hi this is a great app for drawing simpson 's and is a good deal for free . see you later guys
scrabble is my favorite board game and i am so happy to finally have it on my tablet . it is fairly easy to operate and enjoyable .
the eggs take too long to hatch and the amount of in-game coins that the items cost is too high .
wish y oh did n't have t o buy a upgrade to play the game . but i love it . great game .
its wonderful challenging each level . keeps your mind going . thanks . cant wait until i finish each level whats next . super
we have had this game for a long time and the 3 and 5 year old still enjoy it . i have n't bought the full version , but the free one works well .
great time playing . great hours of fun fun fun . a lot of fun times . great time playing . well worth the money .
not exactly like the original tetris i remember playing . it is fun , & challenging . it is a good time passer !
i deleted this app . after i downloaded it and opened it i saw that this was just not my kind of game .
fun game some of the later level start to get hard . but it makes you think lots of fun get it
i like this game . seems simple enough , and it is ; but it really is hard to figure some of these words out . i have enjoyed playing it .
i hate this app it is very hard to guess which one it is so ya anyways and i dislike this app alot .
so far it works good for me i just downloaded it so i would have it if i needed it .
i have this game loaded on all my devices ( 4 ) and i love playing it . i definitely recommend to everyone that likes this type of game
it works pretty much as i expect . it 's nice to have a favorites list , so i do n't have to find my channels again .
the pop up to rate this game has been coming up every few hands even if you click no thanks . it is annoying and if it continues i will delete this game .
fun and challenging all at the same time great time killer can lose track of time playing very easily ! have fun
its a chill game and easy to pick up a play . the system of control is a little weird at first but once you try it gets easier . works great on the galaxy s3 . enjoyable game !
this is great and i use this on my kindle and i love it very much not problem in the world with it
i love this game and played it every day , but recently it had gotten loading issues . tried uninstalling it and starting over but now ca n't get past the login screen . please fix the bugs .
the graphics suck considering the capabilities today and it is so repetitive it gets boring . i 'm probably going to delete it .
simple enough and pretty fun . it works perfectly fine on my kindle fire . i like it a lot and i 'm considering buying the full version .
easy to learn , fun to play . i would recommend this game . i have had hours of entertainment playing . only problem is figuring out how to use coins .
i love hidden object games , this one is a little different which is great i love it so far . please make more .
i like this game it is fun . i like the way it is set up . i would recommend it to anyone that likes word search games .
this is a fast moving game that keeps you thinking , it 's fun to see the difference in the levels and figure out how to defeat the boss , , i really enjoy it
not really my cup of tea . i like the traditional bingo games . i was fun for a short while but not a game i normally play .
i love that words with friends is now mobile for me . i played every day on my laptop and now can take wwf with me on my kindle .
this is a fun game . the levels get harder as you go and it works your brain . hope you get the game it is fun and enjoyable .
i love this game it is so cool ! it is very addicting ! whoever gets this game will have a better kindle , ipad , ipod , and whatever else they have . this game is so freakin awesome
i wear glasses and this app is great big numbers easy . to see and just as easy to use . thanks
i like this app a lot . i have downloaded many bingo games and they did n't work but this one does .
i was right into the game and then it said i had to buy the rest when on the app store it said it was free , bummer
this game is great ; the only thing that would make the app better is if you could make your own combinations of the three available opponents to change up the play order . otherwise , it 's excellent .
my daughter loves this game . i like that you can make it harder as you go along . it is also nice and colorful .
love it . but will it ever be over ? i do n't care if it ever is cause i can keep playing for now .
great app . level selection is very accurate . like the & quot ; angry birds & quot ; feel of the challenging mode . good for any age .
this game seems fun : ) i like that you are n't sucked into buying more points at the store . i like word games usually .
what is really the point of an alarm on your kindle ? i do n't know . between your alarm clock , phone and everything else . there is no need .
i like this one better because it tells you if it is a word or not . i like the hints to .
not really into video games but you get to fight and kill things . not looking towards . the spider thing but i think this game rocks so far
the game is fun and relaxing to play . it being a free app for my kindle fire is great too .
love this app ! totally addictive but i 've had trouble with it freezing more often than not on my kindle fire .
app will not open . keeps closing . frustrating if it opens u get half way through and it closes and you start all over and it does it again
could n't figure out how to make anything work other than the key which quickly became useless . nothing but a door . even had a hard time deleting it ,
this is a fun game not being free is kind of a bummer but the time u do get to play it is cool would love more free stuff thanks for the game good over all
it awesome it mostly modern music and that 's good cause that 's all i listen to lol also it not all guess the song you have to guess the artist to
this game is just like the old version . very easy game to play , like the different version that are available .
this game is filled with fun things . you have to try to earn acorns and coins to get animals . you also get blue stars when you get all of them you go on to the next level .
cute graphics but it is nowhere as smooth as temple run . it does n't respond to the finger swipe nearly as well , either . needs work .
this app is a good time killer and zombie simulator . i 've only had it for 2 hours and im addicted to it
if you would lower the price i might be willing to buy it and rate a little higher . only gave it as high as a two cuz i like the board game version
seems like a nice idea , but goes from too easy to too hard too quickly . just ends up being frustrating .
i 'm not sure why i got this app , but glad i did . it gives me something to entertain myself when i have time to kill .
this is a really neat radio app , you can chose from a lot of stations from all over the country .
i really want to get this app but im not allowed to get apps that are not free . other than that it sounds great !
i like that there is a variety of choice of sudoku games as well as different levels . i would recommend this .
i absolutely love this app . i play with all my friends and family . i recommend this app to everyone . it 's so much fun to play before i realize it it 's very late at night .
i love this game ! there 's always lots to do and the game play is easy to understand . need something to help pass the time ? this game is perfect ! ! !
i have played this for a while , and on the first levels it was addicting , but as you go into harder levels , it gets boring .
i love this game ! ! i bought the monkey to go with the bunny , and i loved the action packed adventures and the high flying adventures
i love this app and i love price even more ! it is by far the best app for browsing reddit .
my grandkids age 2 and 9 love this game . they have so much fun playing it . it is a favorite !
any game that lets you kill zombies with a car that is full of weapons is great for anyone of any age
this is really awesome and the best thing about it is where you can talk to people across the world and make new friends .
good vocabulary builder for growing kids . makes you really think about word associations . good for keeping the brain active on those boring days .
i love this app . it is something i use every night when i can not see the moon . had no problems or crashes so far .
ended up deleting the game because my daughter became bored very quickly with the game . she was able to get through level 1 but the second level was difficult and not very entertaining .
it is fun making your own village because you can design it the way you want it to look like
it keeps locking up . i have to reinstall to make it work . sorry i bought it . i am using a kindle fire .
not a good game boring lame easy stupid not for people over 10 but if u r then go and get it
it seems to work great . unfortunately , there is n't much of a selection of books that i would like to read or hear .
i think this is a game that young children would enjoy playing . it is simple enough for even a very young child .
fun app . fun to play . fun to play . fun to play . would be harder if it was not fun to play but it is fun to play . oh , it is fun .
see how well you can control the maze and not drop the ball . takes skill and speed to finish this game .
i was looking for something my 2 year old grandson could play . he loves it . i 'm if you have younger children they will like it also .
this is the best app i have purchased to date . i hope to get the hole files soon . i need wifi to upgrade .
very addictive and challenging game . i 've played it over and over again . i only wish there were more levels . lots of fun !
this is challenging and fun to play . some can be very difficult to figure out , while others seem to jump right out at you . i would recommend this game for enjoyment .
i really love these pic games some of them are easy but others are harder and really make you think to get the answers . fun for the entire family young and old .
love the many boards and variety of tile sets to chose from . my favorite of all the games available . plan to order more .
finally they have it for kindle i 've been waiting for it ... it works perfectly it 's not slow at all . i love it
yeah , this is okay , i was bored and downloaded it . it on some days is right on which i find very weird .
game is terrible . i wouldnt recomend to anyone over 10 years old . its controls are ok. the view is bad . the plot sucks . the only good thing is its free .
i love the game it is fun and i love fish so a double ya but all in all i love the game
i like this app . i can catch up on the news when i need to . the graphics are nice and the set up of reading the news is simple . download & amp ; have fun reading .
this game is brilliant ! challenging and beautiful in the hd . i wish i had known about it all along and look forward to many more rooms .
really only ten super easy levels i know its free and all but u can do better than that . i guess the game is okay but not wat i wat i was hoping for .
thought i would like this but cant get it figured out so dont go to pinterest very much . maybe will learn someday .
it is really a lot of fun , even the younger can play giving us the chance to play together challenging scores
this game is as much fun as candy crush . i think that i will like this game better . i have found that i am playing this game more then the other game .
i just got the game and i already got more than 200 coins added to 500 coins . this is a great game , overall .
objects was not very clear to find . that 's what made the game so great . you almost had to look at it from a distance .
i have played this game on paper for years . the only thing was that you had to download another app to play this app . after everything was downloaded the game was great .
i that it was just awesome with all of the guns you can shoot real guns . and it tells you
i love this game so much ! i find i am playing it more than others . this is the best game in the world ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
this is one of the best games i have ever played . it kind of feels like u r really on the titanic if u keep playing
this is a really fun game . it 's fast , but gives bonuses often , so you can play or a while before you run out of coins .
its ok but it takes too long to load at first but in the end its great little game buy i love all of the story games b/c they are all great .
the adds come after every single move and its annoying and . sometimes the only way to get out of it is to completely close out of the game..
this is a pretty fun game . it can be a little slow on getting the powerups . can take time to open the next episode .
fun game i like to draw so it is fun has lots of colors and little things to do on it .
i like the game but add multiplayer i have everything so could u get a update and a multiplayer as a new addition
this game is one of the best games i 've ever played on the kindle fire . it 's so fun ! people need this app .
use it all of the time . i used this every day to check out what is happening on face book
good game . some guy said that its not even like angry birds , so i guess its a good thing that its not . ( its should be it 's , sorry )
when your trying to aim it 's way to slow . i want it better . please fix this . i finally got this and that 's the problem . please fix .
its pretty fun but it gets boring waiting for the people to like draw something back . other than that it is an awesome game . i recommend to anyone who likes to draw ! ; )
this game is called link and it is lots of fun . i never played a similar game to this one so its original to me
i think this game is very good and very addictive wish some of these levels were a little easier to beat
i happen to find this game to be a refreshing , fun twist on the match 3 style of puzzle games .
it is fun to play , but does not give daily credits like most others . i play it once in a while , but not as often as i do others .
this is just a fun thing to do when you get tired of the games where you have to concentrate a little more . granddaughter loves it .
i play this game all the time and it actually helps me lose stress . i recommend it for all who like slot type games .
this game is amazing . i think that every one who can download this app , should . this is super fun app that allows . u to colorado and draw
the game is great and all but when i updated every time i tried to change levels it went straight back to a mother board . frustrating . but other wise great game .
this game os awsome this game is like a test and a memory game plus i give this game 5 star like movies
love the different choices . i have n't decided which i like the best . i just wish there was an undo button .
i love it ! i was disappointed that i couldnt get flappy bird because it looked so fun and cute ! but now they have this and i like it ! xd
this game is fun but the only real problem is the tools and weapons only come with ten hits then it dies .
it 's fun to play when you have a few minutes to spare . really easy to pick up just point and shoot .
its really addicting . ive been playing it for a few days now and i am fully addicted . i would be willing to pay $ 0.99 for an upgrade !
5stars when it works but i constantly have to uninstall and reinstall this game to see player turns . it even does n't work correctly on multiplayer on just this kindle fire .
was fun when i was a kid , but not so much any more . i guess it kind of let my old memories down .
this is my local news channel and with this app , i do n't have to turn on the television to know what 's going on in the world .
it 's ok but hard to work and see . i really need one i can print . probably works fine for others , just not for me .
i downloaded it for the camera aspect but it is very confusing and hard to use . waste of an app .
great game ! it is very challenging and keeps your interest for hours of fun . you have to download this game ! it is a keeper !
this game is lots of fun . i enjoy playing it when i have down time , or just when i have had dinner .
wanted a new game , i liked the game , but a little to expensive . i did like the graphic design .
the app works great but it asks to update frequently and then the update does n't process . otherwise very easy to use .
great game very addictive and you get lots of bonuses ... i love this game ! i have gotten a lot of friends hooked on this game ...
like the way you can change it up for a more challenging game . checkers is easy but it still makes our granddaughter plan her moves
great game ! i really enjoy playing it . but what would make it even better would be to have a relaxed mode so you can play the game without having to worry about a time limit .
i love to play this game . its fast its fun and its something to keep you busy when you have a few minutes . i wish there was different levels
great little town building sim with tons of quests and cool characters . social aspects and purchases are helpful but not intrusive . too addictive !
i have been getting this book for a while and was very happy to find an app for it on my phone .
i really enjoy playing the game but the ads are kind of a bother . they keep popping up after about every 5 games .
i really love this app . it works well with my phone . i have no problems with it , very easy to use and navigate
kids love it and i love that they are learning while playing it . actual game , not just puzzles like most kids apps for kindle
i love that i can track the progress i go . i feel like it helps me to really focus , awesome !
i have n't played it but my 9 yr old daughter and my 7 yr old son seem to like it a lot . if they 're happy , i 'm happy .
it 's okay i just wish it would connect with facebook so i can get full access to stuff . on kindle fire when you try to connect to facebook the screen just goes blank .
i really enjoyed this game . i played it on a droid razr . it probably would have been easier on a bigger screen , but i was able to find everything and beat the game .
hours of fun and lots of searching on the internet good to be able to reset and then earn more clues the next time
it 's an ok app i mean you can view all your pics and follow people and stuff but yo have to pay to actually post things so it 's ok
stupid but worth my time when i am bored . but just to let u guys know yes it is random results
this game is great ! a new spin on tetris with fun power ups and time challenges ! i love it ! i would recommend it to any tetris player !
if the game maybe explained things better or dates out with more tips it would be easier but i will get it eventually .
fun game to keep your mind thinking . makes you really remember some logos from your childhood . my husband and i enjoyed seeing who could get it first .
this is one awesome game i love to play it it must be one of the most addicting games in the amazon appstore
starts out easy , but gets more difficult . my advice is save your coins . it is a good way to spend time waiting at dr. offices .
great game and a lot of fun to play . it takes time to build up money and diamonds but it 's worth it in the end . i say buy it .
the graphics were ok but the game was hard as it was really hard to control your pool stick . fix that problem and that could improve this game a lot .
my computer was down and i was missing my words with friends . this helped fill my down time and i enjoyed being able to play .
i love this app i think it is the best game like ever and i do n't say that about any game
did n't care much for the task killing portion . but found the quick glance at what could move to the sd card handy . until i found another app built just for that .
really helps with the pictures on my kindlefire . its easy to use and really helps bring the best out of the pictures you take
such a great game ! i 've downloaded all of them , and i might be a little addicted ... but it 's fun ! i keep getting stuck though . i 'd recommend it to anyone !
i love it . it has lots of levels and different types of challenges with so either so many moves or being timed .
hate to be forced to write a review in order to play . would prefer to pay and get rid of ads . game is awesome though
really fun . ok story and ok graphics . lol lol lol lol lol lol lol lol lol lol lol lol lol
i like the game but i have been doing level 24 for two weeks and it is doing my head in
i do n't understand the game , but my 8 yr old daughter loves it . i am happy as long as she is happy .
love this game . however when i updated this app i lost all my points , levels etc . and i do not like the new format .
you need to get the full game in order to play , you get three hands with the free game , the game cost 0.99
the dinosaur day game is a little boring you just touch dinosaur and the dinosaurs do a move but it would be a good game for toddlers .
this is a fun game . keeps my daughter interested and happy when we are waiting but i wish she was able to play for longer periods of time
this app is sooo cute . if you love animals then you should get this app . the pictures are so cute . : )
love my angry birds no matter what it 's called . each game adds a new challenge to it . if you like angry birds , you love this .
great game ! awesome graphics and wonderful support . beware very addictive ! one of the best slots on amazon and easy to play , hours of great entertainment . you definitely should give this game a try = )
i did care for this game . i wish they would they made it better . get more credits . then it be better .
if dev can add zombies this will be the greatest game ever . as it is , replay value is limited as mentioned by others
great great great game and i love it you can get it for free i will play it a lot : o
this is a very fun app . it is an excellent way to learn new words and get better at spelling and definitions
the best version of the game . i 've looked for a good version and i finally found a good one . thx for the game
it is a good app but i should be able to save my designs like i said it is a good but not great
this is a fun app for all ages . my husband and i play it all the time and then play it back to see out work . fun !
i like to play this to help pass time when i am bored or just feel like i need something to do to keep my hands busy !
i love mahjong and hope to have many hours of entertainment with it . i am impressed that it comes with a story .
this is so awesome that the kids i baby sit love it so much that i go home with a dead battery on my kindle
this game soo much fun it is super addictive so you should get this game really badly . get it now
it gives me something to do to pass the time . it does n't require any thinking , which is sometimes a good thing . but we all need something to exercise our brains .
did n't like the idea that you can only download music but can burn it using it on your kindle , use to using this product on a desk top .
it 's ok. played it but it had too much things to do and being a busy mom did n't have the time to work on it so i deleted it .
why why must i get it they made me right this review its stupid the game is also it tells u what to do dont buy it
i did not like this app . i uninstalled it . there were too many ads . it was not easy to install either .
i really enjoyed working through all of the levels . it is a treat time management game . ca n't wait for airport mania 3 !
i did n't like this game that much . it was very hard to control and the plane went out of control very easily . do n't get this app ...
nice game really helps on long road trips addicting and free . this is one of those games that i love
it is a fun game with some challenges , but it is a nice and awesome game to play with your friends and family
i just love this game . the graphics are just awesome . i have already got several bingos and i am just on level 3. best of all it is a free app .
its fun just wish had more energy . it would be nice that instead of using a full energy only a half .
i is awesome ! before i got this i didnt like horses but no i think there cute ! download now ! it is so awesomely awesome
you only get 3 articles a day , but there is a wide variety of articles to chose from . i think this is basically fair for free .
i have been playing this game all day and love it . very easy to master and an excellent time killer . works great on nook color .
could be more challenging . only on level 20 so maybe . not sure how many levels there are . that is all .
i love playing it . just has too many ads popping in on us . my husband and i play it with our friends all the time its hard to put it down .
well , this app is just wonderful . i use it on my galaxy tab and it works perfectly . the ui is very nice , meaning it works great on my tablet . keep up the great work .
wonderful music for the season ! i am so glad you offered it to me free ! ! i would have bought it anyway though . thank you for the christmas bonus !
my 7 year old daughter loves this game - it really keeps her attention and she enjoys playing it on the kindle fire hd .
this was not want i thought it was going to be . but it is a lot of fun if you like hidden objects .
this is one of the best games i have played in my life but they should add more costumes in the game
i absolutely love this game . i recommend this game to everyone who enjoys word puzzles . the puzzles are really fun to play they also have a daily puzzle .
nice app i would recommend to all kids who like angry birds and temple run very similar concept and a very nice non violent game for kids & all kids that love angry birds would like this
i love this app it gives me and my friends idea 's what to do with our nails best app on the planet
this game is terrible i would not tell you to get . when you first get it you cant do nothing
this app is great it is really fun . it 's a good app . i think you should get it . it 's really fun .
this is a very good app it is a little addicting but its fun it could use a little of updating with the movies
i love this game . it is so so so addicting ! its challenging which is what makes it fun . i even like that they put their own logo as a question .
the burn the hole mini game is very difficult and there is no skip option and i had to delete the game because it was too difficult . otherwise i love that it is n't a short app .
i. did n't like the game . each pass with the arrow took forever to take an action . i usually end up buying the game apps i try but not this one .
i have enjoyed this game . i have beat all my friends . i am an angry birds fan and ca n't seem to quit .
great game ! i like being able to play at my own pace ! recommend this game to anyone who likes word games ! the characters are great as well !
not much fun to play on the kindle fire , at least not for me . maybe the paying version would be better , but this one kept freezing up so i deleted it .
this app was not very exciting but it was a time filler for the holiday . would not have paid for it .
very good turn my kindle fire hd into more then i could ever hope for need a good shot i now got the camera .
i use this app regularly and would recommend it to anyone . i use it on my phone and my kindle fire .
does n't work do n't buy it . i hate it . you wo n't like it . it 's not what you want to get . it is not the same
i love having a place to keep all my favorite things so i can go back and find them again .
one of the better bingo games . cute graphics & amp ; the payouts are fairly often . highly recommend if you 're looking for a laid back game of bingo .
my grandson got this and seems to like being able to follow his favorite sports teams . he is almost 11 years old so it must be an easy program to use ! !
this is awesome ! it is the best makeup and hair app i ever played , i have no idea why people hate it , i highly recommend it for all girls !
this game is quite frustrating at times -- and yet i ca n't stop playing it ! it 's got my husband and 10 year old hooked as well !
all the interaction that comes with the story is great and they keep adding more and more stories .
love this game . it is so much fun and fast paced . even got my husband hooked on it .
i loved this game . it has lots of different levels so the adventure never ends . i play it all the time . some of them are quite hard but it 's a lot of fun .
its like you have a real horse . its very creative and interesting . it has decent graphics i was very surprised . it is very addictive and entertaining
one of my favorite games to play on my on my kindle fire . glad i was able to get this game . love it ! ! ! !
login page is very slow . most games are so slow they are unplayable .
again i have to play the same games over and over . makes me not want to play it often . i expected a better game .
it 's good , and it is almost exactly like flappy bird , so i recommend it to anyone who likes that game .
started playing last night and had to make myself stop to go to bed ! ! ! ca n't wait to start again tonight ! ! !
the game is easy to navigate and comes up with words i have to look up ; ( it 's fun to have while waiting and for just a break .
so i push the coins off the edge , what a thrill , do not waste your time , i am sorry i did .
i love this game . daily bonuses , gifts ... i can play this one for hours . all of my favorite slot games are on here .
i found this game interesting . it is a great time filler . each level is challenging and fun to play . it is a great time filler for the doctors office .
i didnt really use this app . i only played with it for a little bit after i got my kindle fire .
would be better if the letters were a tad larger . found that the game would not respond on occasion . was no way to complete the game because of this .
this app is everything that you would need provided you just wanted to do the simple things like transfer some money or check your balance .
i tried this one and was n't impressed . ads and constant updates made me remove it quickly . i will wait for something better .
yes finally this game is free ! ! i have been wanting this game for sooooo long and now it is free , get it and you wo n't regret it
this game is another fun dash game i really enjoyed it . kind of repetitive but it was enjoyable as well .
it even poops ! ! ! ! i have flappy birds on my galaxy s3 but i think this one is better ! ! that it works on my 1st generation kindle fire makes it even better .
this is just as involved and complicated as the crush , , great graphic lay outs . love the fact u can use zen mode to work on puzzles and relax or not .
this game is fun for all ages . even elementary school children can enjoy it , but it is challenging enough for adults as well .
great crossword puzzle . love it would recommend . this puzzle to any one . try it out . hope you enjoy it too .
it 's a cool app but do any of u guys know how to update this or mine craft on the kindle
recipes are easy and the way they are shown are excellent to use . i would recommend this magazine even to a novice
i do n't get this game at all could someone in the next reveiw and tell me how to play . thanks : )
this game is super fun -- i love it ! ! considering it is a free game , its pretty dang good ! love the graphics too ! all around great !
you can spend hours playing this game and for those who spend time alone it really helps keep your mind sharp !
this is just as good as the apple aquarium and i like playing it more . more options and cheaper to maintain . this is more fun .
i love playing this game . my son loves zombies and he likes this game also and i play it every day
my wife loves solitaire and this is her app . i was told it is fun to play by her . i should had let her write this .
i love this game ! ! its so cute and addicting ! ! ! i 'm not into scary zombie games , this is fun to play and kid friendly
i 'm enjoying playing this game ... not the same as vegas , but still fun . you can turn sound off if needed & amp ; there does n't have to cost a single penny !
match 3 games are never ending keeps my mind sound and active . the many levels keeps me surprised and entertained
i enjoy this game very much that i do n't forget to play it every chance i can . it is very challenging . and interesting . once you start it you wont be able to put it down .
i like this game i just wish it took up less space but you also have to be patient to wait for items to be built .
story line was a little boring . the characters were dull . the one thing that i liked was the graphics . nice detail and background .
i love to play mahjong and i thought this might me fun , but i do n't like it as well as i like other mahjong games .
sort of brings back memories of childhood . played this in school during quiet time . this is a great app for kids . good for keeping them occupied on long trips or in waiting rooms .
this is cool but i have n't played minecraft so i do n't know these things ... ... . they are creepy i want them to make a robot one
hidden object , matching 3 or more , and a storyline , although very fantasy based , makes for a lot of fun . collecting resources to build too .
this is exactly what i like update news when i want it watch this app while i watch something else
this game is such a great way to pass time . and it it too fun to put down ! i suggest it to all my tablet friends .
this latest installment is great . the different sections of the store are so involved it really takes the game to a new level . my absolute favorite game thus far .
great game you get to actually create your own house . the only set back is the tasks and the amount of time it takes to get the item you purchased . but overall this game is great .
it was easy to download and has been easy to play . the only thing that i have n't liked is when i exit out my play is n't always saved where i left it .
absolutely just love this game worth every bit . just try it and you will love it too . prizes or great .
i do not like it one bit it is so so so so bad ! ! ! ! you better fix it or kids will hats you
love it ... much easier to use for me than regular twitter and on my fire kindle its great . i would highly recommend .
love this game ... wish it would give more coins like other games but other than that excellent game ... play all the time !
i enjoy the action pack , the flying and shooting , i have lots of fun and when i get better at it i will buy the upgrade .
this is one of my most used apps . where ever i am i just hit it and i know exactly what is going on as far as the radar . would never be without it .
love this game best bingo by far . never have any problems never freezes like other bingos . i really do recommend this game .
i deleted the game because it was not what i expected of slot games . i am unable to remember if after time playing , it required that i purchase points .
this game is fun for a free game . it does take awhile to regenerate grabs but you do n't have to pay for them unless you are too impatient .
its a lot of fun . its hard after a while . i really want the other version . for now download the free one : ) .
funny . clever . worth the price ( free ) . ca n't get laughs any cheaper than this . did i mention it was unique ? play it .
it is very handy to have the facebook app . you can quickly check notifications and chat with friends without having to waste time finding the site .
this app would only allow me to go to a certain number if elements and then it would erase everything ... my advice ; do not get this app ! ! ! ! !
i love this game it 's a little bit hard but mostly easy . great for kids older than 8 years old
this game sucks ! i thought i liked it but it was a piece of junk minecraft pe is far superior and also survival craft rocks too . both of those games can kick block story 's but !
it is a great game for puzzle lover 's . i loved the first game in the series and am excited to see a second game !
kids love it . very simple book to move around in and to read regularly will buy more soon . thank you .
good game i just wish my kindle would connect to facebook through it . the price is a buck but it 's free on the phone wish it was the same
this app is a lot of fun and i enjoy the questions ! this game tests your knowledge and i love to watch the movie again and try to do better on the quizzes .
think again ... loads of fun but not so easy . very cool to play and you do get some help if you ca n't figure it out .
i could not complete floors without the guide and i do n't care for games that i can not figure out on my own . i became frustrated over and over again . not my cup of tea .
i love this app my whole family loves it too it is fun if is cool too i get to play air hockey : )
this game will keep you entertained for hours . i am not much of a gamer , but i love this game . it is fun and challenging .
it 's a fun game , not hard to learn and easy to remember the tips . definitely would recommend for anyone especially kids .
love how i can change all of my apps to make it a default app for if i want to automatically start it !
this game is awesome ! ! ! ! it has a lot of logos and some of them are hard to find out , but others are way easier ! : )
this is more my hubby 's game and i have to steal my kindle back when he is not looking , so i know he loves it . he does not want to put it down
i like to challenge my mind and this is certainly a good way to do it . i have n't played the timed games yet , but will in the near future .
love this game , plays great on my kindle fire 2nd generation . different than some match 3 games that i have played .
so far , so good . just started playing this game but i like it so far . graphics are crisp looking . i love escape games
i like bejeweled blitz the best , but this game is also fun and has some challenges . there are different levels and some are more interesting than others so i would give it a try .
i love mahjong but this was awful . i wanted to play a 3d version of game , but the controls just did not respond on the kindle .
this is a really great little game to pass the time . has some pretty good graphics as well . like all the weapons and such .
i really liked this , but then it just stopped working on my kindle . i did all the tricks just would n't work . i use yahoo know and it works great .
it is like the bad version of mine craft . you ca n't even save your world . i have no good words to say .
i never get bored with this app . i play with friends and people i 've never met . after playing with people better at it than me , i have gotten much better too ! love this app !
awesome game ! ! i enjoy playing all the time . graphics are good for this type of game . give it a try !
it seems to be a kid version of flow . it 's not much different , so i uninstalled it . not bad if free .
this calculator app is great and its very helpful for everything i need it for ! ! you should really get it ! !
not a real user of facebook so i can not really rate the application it gets and brings up page quickly
you know when you have that moment when someone says `` whatever you want '' , or the `` i do n't know '' just let this handy app decide for you . fantastic !
i play this all the time . so much fun and easy to use for the first time . love this app .
i run through the available words too fast and it does n't have levels to progress through . each word is one level . there may be more than 100 levels , but that only means 100 words .
i really enjoy playing this game . for this being a free game i am really impressed ! lots of fun ... well worth the download .
i use this on my kindle and like the card action . i waste a lot of time with this but enjoy it very much !
keeps me entertained . so far its really easy ... ..but based on other reviews it should get more difficult . excited to get to the more challenging levels .
i had this on my ipod and now i have it much bigger on my kindle fire ! its my favorite app and would recommend it to anyone who loves fun apps
this game has totally awesome graphics and story line . i just finished playing and i ca n't wait to play number two . keep these cool games coming please .
when i seen it i said its fake but i seen the reviews and it was about clothes and that was what i wanted now i can get the coolest stuff ever
this app is really fun and it is challenging . my friends and i just love to play together . i recommend it .
the product is fine . i do n't have a problem with it . the improvements that were made are good and it looks great .
this is pretty cute and nice for little kids ! i think the little ones will enjoy it ! ! so yeah ... .it has a few glitches though
all you do is wait around to feed the baby . it does n't need changing , playing with or have wants . very boring .
i have since deleted this application . not because i did not like it , i did , but because i have too many apps and not enough space on my tablet .
i am playing with my 9 year old granddaughter and it is a great way to stay in touch . this is for 2 people not one , so get a drawing partner !
this is a fun game that my three year old grandson taught me . unfortunately , he 's much better at it than his grandma !
if you like dragonvale you will love this game . it 's kinda like dragonvale and dragon city put together . it 's a game you will not want to stop once you start playing .
i love this game the graphics on it are amazing ! i 'm not that good at the game , but it 's still awesome . i highly recommend this game to anyone .
this game is a good game , very easy to play . i play this game just about every day . i like it .
this is a wonderful app . i just love old movies . i have a older kindle fire hd and it runs good . it 's also refreshing that it actually had direct tv as a provider .
really enjoy this app . like the way the tiles change from puzzle to puzzle , makes you pay close attention and not become boring .
could be more current . expected breaking news but most news is more to the old side . a little disappointed in the app
is fine but you only get a limited number of puzzles and then if you want more you have to pay cash , so i did the free ones and deleted it .
be warned things take for ever like wen you buy a monster it takes for ever to hatch bit otherwise is ok
most enjoyable lack of frustration within an app yet ... pleasant graphics and music ... fun ... fun ... fun ... just the right level of challenge to be rewarding ...
i really enjoy this game . it is challenging but fun . i enjoy the graphics as well as the pace of the game . i love the way it looks on my kindle . no issues .
i find the associations very challenging which help me to keep my mind sharp . my mom turned me on to this . she is much better than i am so i am working hard to improve : )
i actually really enjoyed this game . very easy to get used to the game play . but complex enough to make it challenging with being frustrating . love it !
too hard , i am dissapointed with the game overall . i would pick another type of game over this one . i bought it with coins , so i am really not out anything .
just started playing and i 'm already addicted . lots of variation on some familiar games but this time they are all in one game
love , love , love this game . it is so addictive i ca n't put it down ! anyone who loves puzzle games will enjoy this one .
i got this app for my kindle and really like it and is easy to use . i would recommend it .
i play this game every day . it is one of the best bingo games out there . and you get credits every 4 hours . this free game really is free !
this game is very fun to play if it ends up working for you . i like it and it 's definitely not a waste of time .
graphics are better than ever . no ads . i love killing monkeys ! this is the best angry birds so far . i am having so much fun playing it . evo user .
this game works just fine . other than a few pop up ads ( which are common for free games ) it works just fine !
i have found it to be a fun , pass the time game . the mini games are my favorite . like others have said , its sort of like farmville , but with a twist .
this game is so fun . i love it but it kind of reminds me of pokemon . i still like it though . i love games like this . cant wait to keep playing it ! ! ! !
great fun for one and even more with friends ! can be habit forming what with the bright graphics and sound effects ! lots of fun for one and all !
this game is really fast paced and really addictive ! its challenging but in a great way and it could keep you entertained for hours ! the graphics are great and super cute ! recommended for all ages : )
it will get compared to angry birds but is different enough to be a completely different experience . definitely a lot of fun .
i enjoy this game . it keeps the mind working and makes you think outside of the box . however it does become addictive .
i like puzzles so i like this app . it passes the time . but like many apps , if you want more puzzles , then you will have to upgrade .
i hate this game . its just like the first only worse i cant belive that u had to pay for it . totally a huge rip of ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ' !
i 'm a fan of these types of games but this one was just ok to me . i did n't get into it as much as i hoped .
it looks like a fun game . but dont read those please . you have to play it first to see if you like it or not . so please play this game .
super super super super super supper super game play for anger issues hay did you find the mistake yet ? yeah you found it did n't you
this app works perfectly for me everytime . i have no complaints whatsoever . if you have netflix and a kindle fire this app is great in my opinion .
i love love love this game and am glad it 's finally available for my kindle . it can become addictive , enjoy and have fun ! ! !
this game is fun but i had to get rid of a lot of my games i already have and it takes a long time to download but it was worth it for the fun battles
fun game loads fast on my htc thunderbolt .. hope they come out with more levels keep up the great job
does n't work for the new update . when you try to tap inventory then it says it has stopped . please fix .
i thought this game would be fun by it was very very bad it was boring i hats this game
farkle is a fun fast moving game so you can play a game or two any time you have a few spare minutes .
for free this is a great game , but limited number of puzzles is kind of disappointing . some of the puzzles made little sense , but again , it 's free .
awesome game i would recommend this game and the graphics are awesome and the hidden objects are great and you will not put the game down until you finish it .
i am trying to get faster , it is a fast game . fun to challenge yourself , and i do . moves around real nice and allows you to get at ones you may have thought were hidden .
i love all the mahjong games . it keeps my eyes and my mind sharp while allowing me to enjoy my time away from work .
do you have a few seconds to waste while you 're on hold ? or maybe in line at the bank ? this is just the game its quick and easy .
my 8 year old and her friends have fun with this , but it 's really designed for younger kids . i 'm not deleting it , just because it is colorful and something different to keep around .
i like this game . it starts you put with basically free hints , making it a little easier to continue on with the levels . a more fair game .
i enjoy this game by myself but even more with my 6 year old grand daughter . it can be enjoyed at any age .
boring game , hard to control , puzzles can be a good challenge , but i want to have fun , not frustration . got it for free and uninstalled it . usually a fan of puzzle games .
this game looks like a great game and it deserves 4 stars or 5 stars . plus it looks like a 4 to 5 star game !
i think this game is fun and cute . if u do n't have a pet like me this game will be for u or anyone just get the fun game
the most amazing app ever . the whole family really enjoys all the great movies that we can watch over and over . highly recommend getting this app .
this game is sooooo fun and additive ! if you get it today it 's free if you do n't it is worth the dollar !
this game is entertaining and interesting for those of us who enjoy brain games . i think that it would be suitable for anyone . i have enjoyed playing it .
this game is a lot of fun to play . some levels can be very challenging as well which is a great workout for your brain . enjoy !
it is so fun i have had my kindle for 2 years it was one of my first ever app i still love it i can play it for hours ! ! ! ! ! ! !
i really like this slot game . the graphics are good looking and the winning is fun ! the progress of getting new levels goes fairly fast i think everyone would enjoy these games .
ok , i like fast food so this is a fun game just to see how many logos i remember . i enjoy playing it when i have some spare time .
so much better than # 3 better graphics , faster , easier cheaper power ups , fun fun fun ! love playing this , getting more lives makes playing better .
i love this game this game is amazing its a blast omg really you should try it its fun . plz try . and review
i enjoyed this game quite a lot . the graphics are good for the hidden object and the adventure mystery was a challenge . highly recommend .
ca n't download any songs at all . it 's all a lie . literally one minute of me downloading it i deleted it . can only download music they want you to . lame
this is a very addictive game loads of fun and time consuming i hope you will enjoy this as much as i have
it 's a cool game but it keeps freezing and i 'm not very happy that for it the work again ( for a period of time ) i have to down load it again .
saw this game on facebook and decided to give it s try , i love it makes you think and its fun
this app ( game ) is awesome ! i also told my friend to download it . i have to say it again : it is awesome .
this is an awesome game . my nine year old son enjoys this game so much . even my wife and daughter plays it . keep up the good work glu .
this is the best game ever ! ! ! ! ! it is so fun i ca n't stop playing it ! ! ! i 'm so addicted i was up all night last night playing it ! ! !
amazing game . the graphics are great and the game play is freaking stunning . this game might not be for younger ages but anyone else you 'll have as much fun as i have
now i do n't mind a challenge . in fact , i love them . the problem is that it is just plain out stupid .
i love to play this game . i was first introduced to this game on facebook , and am excited now that it is on my kindle .
most have app . i use this when traveling and love the way of wakes you up in the morning . it does n't scare the hell out of you in the am .
this is an interesting story but the action is not very intuitive . there does seem to be a lot of back and forth as well .
if you like pool this app is for you . takes time to learn controls but is worth it . even my 4 yo has learned to play it .
i got this game as a free app of the day and i love it ! if i would have known how much fun it is , i would have bought it a long time ago !
love this bingo game . easy to play . win quite a bit ... .not frustrating just lots of fun . and it is free ! !
ordered this app for my kindle . this app does what all the reviews says . this is a must have app for any kindle . very pleased with it .
great game ! i have beaten the game and playing all the levels again . best free app of the day but i would pay $ 4.99 .
this is a fun challenging game . fun for the entire family . hours of fun , great for game night , or teams .
the shooting controls are n't all that good . it 's also obvious the people who made this game do n't know jack about guns
rooms are simple , yet very detailed . graphics are great . i have never played a game like this before . definitely worth your time .
it was fine at first , but then while it explained everything it got kind of hard to follow and as a result i got very confused and died alot . i wish they could slow down the instructions
downloaded this game because i love the nintendo ds games brain age and brain age two . this is nothing like them and i only played it a few times before i deleted it .
i decided to put it on my kindle . i am not sure if i will use it .
this one is as good as the first one i have love the adventure while finding the tiles with this
it is a game you have fun playing . you keep going back to this game . this game make you us your mind . you can not wait to see what the next step will bring .
no bad it did the job is a little bit hard to solve maybe good for those genius out there .
omg this game works so great on the kindle fire i can play it for hours and still have fun if u have a kindle fire i suggest that you get this game ! ! ! ! ! ! !
this game is really fun and all but the controls are very poor . i think they can do better . otherwise its fun
it 's fun , easy , and the graphics are sooo adorable . i wish i had some friends playing with me ... thanks for making a great , relaxing game : )
it 's not a major challenge . good for kids , but not any sort of challenge for adults . i 'll keep for now .
having christian music on the go is awesome to me because the local station we have does n't always come in very clear so when that happens i have my phone and this app ready to go .
very great app . i really like it . its one of the best apps . it is worth the dollar and it is very addictive .
would rather have a game that you play against the computer and can replay each hand , not interested in playing on line with other players
this was downloaded by my daughter . i do n't play with it . because of this i really can not give a rating of it .
fun bingo game . moves much faster than the other bingo apps so a bit more challenging . i play for hours !
pay outs are good , daily bonus . chances to level up are good and does n't take forever . good deals on coins .
grand kids love it , they know the characters and like to interact with the situations the characters get into . cool !
very cool game . reminds a ton of theme park , an old pc game i used to play back in the day . give it a try !
love the way i can download songs and their lyrics so i can sign along .i guess we 're never to old to learn .
this thing can talk , but it says stupid and the f word and other inappropriate language and it actually tells you to say the word ! this is bad for kids , do n't download .
this was very fun , tricky sometimes with the picture clues , but other than that it is a fun game . recommend it
i like this game alot ! ! sometimes i wish i had more time but then it would be to easy . great game .
some of the picture seem to have nothing to do with the words , but it is a fun game . just maybe give us some better clues .
i wanted this game when it came out but then i saw that it said 3.99 so i just used my money to get the game and it was worth it .
this is good give 's a lot of joy and is easy to use even my husband can use it and that must be good .
great game . lots of options . easy to start hard to master . recommend highly . good for all ages . challenging enough to keep you interested but not too hard to enjoy .
a game that is free should be free . you should not have to buy it after so many levels . the game was a lot of .
amazing and it works i love it def on it like all the time . u should def get if changes lives people
when i get on my kindle i do n't even tap on the link it just goes straight to it . it 's taking over my kindle i can barely play any other game .
a fun way to pass time and challenge your mind ! a good game for all levels ! spider solitaire is a winner !
text plus is really a great app and its just a bonus that it free . i really suggest that you try this app . i recommend it to everyone .
this game is the best . i was able to do all the levels . spend 99 cents on this game , it 's worth it .
i think you should play fruit ninja it is a very good game.i love how there are all kinds of different fruits like one i have never even heard of !
this is just an okay game . it gets repetitive real quick , but good time waster in the doctors waiting room . glad it free , because i would n't pay for it .
have n't had a lot of chances to use this yet but when i have it 's been fine .
it doesnt show anything but your balance . i gave 3 stars because i like chase online but not on kindle fire it only shows your balance .
i did not download this game , my kids did , but if i let them , they will play it for hours .
i liked this enough to buy the pro version . i recommend this to anyone who likes bowling and/or shuffle board .
not much of a selection even for a free app . do like that at the end of the game it directly asks if you want to play again .
this . game is fun . i enjoy games like this . if you like dress up games you will like this . it is fun for people of all ages !
this is a pretty cool game , the effects are great , ca n't wait to be able to buy another horse and enter bigger competitions .
i was looking for more of a beginner set . i am keeping this app for my older grandchildren , they are loving it , both boy and girl .
fun puzzle game , great to play in short breaks , gives you something to think about which i like , good game
this game is nice and fun to play on occasion . everything takes too long to build . that 's my only problem with the game so far .
my nine year old grandson recommended the game to me . it is fun , but i do n't have everything figured out yet . there should be directions somewhere .
this is a really cool game . i love it because i love movies , but it can be a little challenging sometimes . overall , it 's a great game so everybody go download it now ! ! we
i deleted another solitaire app because it had single ads . this app has the same ads . that is very disappointing .
there once was a clock app as the free app of the day but now there 's this thing in it 's place . funny .
i chose this because this is a hard game and it is free and it is not a really good game .
great very cute character it also has a choice of controls so you can pick which is best for you and a fun challenge based story line yeah
love this game . it is so addicting that you will lose track of time . i would recommend it for anyone doing & # 34 ; brain training & # 34 ; .
the only thing that keeps this from 5 stars is the ads . but the ads are minor and the game is everything you want .
i downloaded it since i have no games on my kindle fire and figured it would be easy but there are a bunch of characters i do n't even know
i absolutely adore this app ! easy and totally fun . my six year old sister and i ca n't get enough of it . we 're addicted
mini quest is a basic rpg in which you have to complete tasks and run through various levels . its a good way to waste the time !
this so much fun . it is easy to play and very addictive . all the prizes and coins and the upgrades wow
what 's not to like ? if you use yahoo , you need this app . i have it on my kindle and my android . i use it daily .
just too good ... love playing it ... just go nd get this app . its good for any age group ... its even a good eye exercise .
awesome ! perfect ! exactly what i was looking for : ) perfect for lists and anything else you can think of . sharing with friends is easy to do too . love love love love love
did not work smooth , lost almost always , and you have to buy in to continue . sorry but it was designed in the houses favor .
i think it 's awesome , but it would be hard for little kids . even i have trouble sometimes ! wish you could skip a level , and hints were cheaper . but overall a great game .
love this silly little game ! just a way to pass the time . i wish you could store up more grabs so i dont have to wait for the timer .
it is a good application and i am glad to have it on my kindle . i would pay for it .
this game is great . it 's a lot of waiting but it 's worth it to destroy everyone lol . dark but pretty amusing when you 're bored !
i love this game ! it us addictive and cool . you will really like it . but ; sometimes the app goes really slow .
really good game of checkers . you can start off by playing easy games up to games that are very difficult .
ran out of credits , was fun till that happen , would love a game you can play and not go on facebook or run out of credits
i do n't like that after 14 plays you have to pay for it . they said it was free , but it is not
its fun but you cant interact with the animals that you buy so if you like farm story then you love it
i had none of the issues others did with steering . it works very well for me , and this is one of my favorite games now .
i liked the puzzles of the game i hope that the next episode is a little more challenging though . i will download the next episode to see .
in my opinion i think that the game 4 pics 1 word was ok but there were sometimes when there were major brain teaser s and i could n't figure it out .
my son loved it and played it often so we purchased it and he still plays it at least twice a week .
i just bought the full version . i 'm writing this review because it asked me every 2 minutes . that 's why the 4 stars .
this game can be lots of fun and very frustrating . have to keep your eyes on the stars ! i enjoy playing this ! !
this game stinks ! no part of it is fun and it is entirely based on luck . not worth coming up with the extra words required for review .
it is good game , but too short . i hope it does n't take too long for their to be new rooms added .
granddaughter was allowed to purchase this on her kindle and is really enjoying it . i find all kindle apps to be both fun and educational in one way or another .
it is like temple run and jetpack joyride put together one of the best games ever and a must get for people of all ages .
i love to play hearts it is very challenging , it is just a good past time , i would recommend it to everyone ! !
once you begin you have to keep going to see how high you can go to the very next level .
you have played angry bird then the same fits . i mean how else can you do the same thing but different names
it was a pretty fun game ! very relaxing for a game ! not to hard ! it can be for any age !
this is the best ever . i could play this game all day if had enough coins . i would recommend this game to everyone to play . , thanks
this game is awesome i can play this game all day long if my mother would let me it is harder when you go farther into the game
can play with or without spending real $ $ . fun additive game . very cute . i experienced very few problems with this app .
i enjoy this game more then candy crush and i do n't feel i need to spend money to advance levels . it 's an option not needed .
love the board game as a kid and it helps your spelling get better is you stink at that . happy the app is available . the extras are my favourite cause they give you an extra challenge .
its a fun game it takes a little bit to get the hang of it but its a lot if fun .
this is a great game that the entire family will enjoy . i like the way it gets more and more challenging with each new level .
fun to play , if you have steady control of your hands . tilting the tablet to play is challenging if you do n't .
i love seeing twitter in such a great app ! i love on my kindle fire how on the app the bird looks so clean !
did n't work on my kindle fire . my signal stayed the same , but try it . it might work for others idk
had to rate for free hint so here you go . i 'm not very far in and already stuck ... i need to do more brain exercises .
it is a great game and makes your brain think by making connections . it is an awesome game for all ages . buy this !
i love word searches and this works great while waiting in doctor offices , late at night when i ca n't sleep i can play this on my galaxy tablet and not have to turn a light on .
fun to play ! medium level difficulty ! more enjoyment than challenge ! lots of fun to use on my new kindle fire hd !
very addictive . sorry to say when i got to level 14 the game reset itself & amp ; i had to start all over again . so disappointing .
i have the original kindle fire which may be the problem - but my wwf games wo n't update ! used to be great but not the last week or so !
i know they try to put the 5 star ones first but honestly it sucks . its harder than flappy birds and i cant get the bird to stay the same color !
7 little words is an excellent game for those of us who love word games ! i am so glad i found 7 little words .
love playing this game . it is quite addictive though so i set aside an amount of time i want to play each day and that has worked well for me .
it 's a good game except that it takes to long for your energy to grow back so you can continue playing
very fun but also very challenging . only on level teen but it seems like i am already addicted to it .
i love this game , it makes me feel better about how they closed flappy birds on the appstore . this game is great if you dont have wifi . you should get it .
the game is really fun me and my brother enjoy it a lot i 'm really glad that i got this game
i love this app ! ! ! ! some of it is funny some of it is weird and some just do n't make any sense at all
very different then most games out there and some of the levels are a lot more challenging then i thought they would be .
would like a version i can play without being hooked to the internet . but it 's fun to play when i can .
i am so glad they finally have the app for the kindle fire . it was n't available on my phone so i can finally play it now ! ! ! best day ever : )
great game , really brings back the memories . other times can be really frustrating . i wonder where some of it came from !
download took forever now i can not open it to play ! why ? ? ? now how do i open it to play ? once i put a name in it will not open !
if you like word games you will love this . it is a most challenging and enjoyable game i have ever downloaded . playing with friends and family is just great fun .
race on . with a terrific story line and superb graphics , this game will blow your mind . download it to experience it .
i absolutely love this game ! i was the first one in my school to play it because a friend from my other school introduced it and everyone in my school is addicted now , including myself !
i 've been playing this game for about 7 months and i love it . i have a great zoo full of animals and they 've added new content . lots of fun !
this is a fun app for my niece . she 's been having a great time w/ it and it looks well made .
very cool game , this is the first game i have downloaded that i am hooked on . the graphics are really good and the sharks movements are really good . very enjoyable . i would recommend it .
good game , it is fun to play , and any one of any age can play it . fun fun fun . thanks
i liked this game a lot the graphics were good and it was a lot of fun to play and to kill time !
so , i just bought da app and decided to get a skin and it actually works unlike garbage that other apps could be .
same thing over and over . i like the zoom feature . do not like the speed of the timed puzzle . okay .
i wish it had more levels and harder ones too because it is pretty easy you could finish this in a day
too hard for the kids and you must replay levels many times to progress but good variety of games . i have not gotten board yet though
my near 4 yr old loves this and will spend lots of time on this game . he is learning numbers and letters at the same time .
i have always had an interest in the night sky . now i can actually identify what i am seeing without having to read through a book .
downloaded this game yesterday and it 's very addicting . graphics is amazing and the instruction are easy to follow . this game is worth getting .
never used it . decided i did n't want it . plus my tablet broke before i was able to use it , got a new one and decided not to download this app .
this game was fun at first but in order to play after the first half hour , you have to buy the next level . this could get very expensive .
i am sad that my mom and baby died but i am going to say that this app is fun i love it !
it 's a good time waster . some you get right away and others you have to think for a while . i would recommend it to anyone .
a great game for interest and challenges . not just a time filler , but something to grab your interest and imagination . well worth playing .
this is fun i like this game la la la la la la la la la la la la la
i do n't think there is a single person now a days who has not used this app . it works great .
makes it very easy to monitor memory and cache usage by apps on the system . nice interface that 's simple to use .
ca n't make it go away . i do n't use it but i ca n't make it go away . i do n't use it but i ca n't make it go away .
perfect for the tablet , easy to learn and use , my new go to for keeping my life in order . highly recommend this app .
addictive ! gets harder as you play . i love this game.i would recommend this to anyone wanting a challenging game . get it !
this is a wonderful game that has you think about how a set of four pictures relate to each other . a great game to play with another person .
i downloaded this game for my husband to use on my kindle . he already has one on his phone , so since i 'm not interested in playing i have no use for it .
best faotd in a while ... fun to play ... challenging and a great way to pass time ... lots of levels and you can replay for better scores ...
awesome app , been playing it nonstop since i got it ! also i like the way you battle in this game
this is a pretty fun game but you can run out of energy pretty fast if you 're not careful . you do n't have to spend your money if you 're patient .
this has a bit of the touch of angry birds but a new way to move your characters it takes practice when you get farther into the game is a great twist you wont go wrong
did not like this version at all . i think it was the ads or something like that . in any event it was deleted . try it for yourself . your opinion may be different .
love t his game my and my kid both play it and she can play for hours if i would let her we use it as a reward program we use she get some much game time
this game is stupid you have to pay for the other 2 people to do their hair actually you have to pay for pretty much everything . also it hardly gives you anything to do .
a lot of fun but also very frustrating , keeps me entertained just wish sometimes i had more than 5 lives at a time
sorry , big bubble , i do n't have enough room on my tablet , and you 're one the ones that had to go .
this game is so fun . too bad it has a little glitch . deal with it . it is not even a major problem
ive only started playing but i must say i have really enjoyed it so far . i just found a new favorite game .
i love this game soooooo much . it is my favorite . i am not ever going to take it off of my kindle
i love this game ! it is challenging but doable . i have played well into the night . in two weeks , i have completed 9 levels and i ca n't wait for more .
this was not what i expected . it did not work for me for some reason . i would have gave no stars , but you have to rate something .
very clean . i love the hints . free cell is my favorite one because it seems like you can always win if you are good at the game .
i have been wanting to get minecraft or at least a substitute for a long time . this game is beautifully designed and is much better than pocket edition . i really suggest you buy it .
a solid logic game that makes you think without driving you crazy . it could use more levels since its addictive and you 'll keep playing until you do them all .
it 's an alright game , pretty simple i prefer hidden objects more but still nice way to keep from being bored .
i have really enjoyed the game it is very challenging i am happy i bought the full version . if you enjoy hidden object games you need to get this game
the game can be fun , but if you make mistakes and need to begin again it costs you some money ,
have played this on my laptop and phone . so of course downloaded it to my tablet . love it ! highly recommend !
mindless fun game . it 's free and will kill time , could even be addictive . works well and has great colors . and it 's free ...
its a great time passer . my husband an i play this together he enjoys trying to guess the icon before i get it .
wonderful free chess game ! basic but all you need to have fun . thank you for putting this out there free . ive enjoyed it immensely
downloading recipes , along with pictures , is easy on my kindle fire . i find myself using chef tap all the time .
just started playing the game and it is ok so far . i am still seeing how it goes . have fun
extremely cute : ) ! you have kids ? this is perfect for them . the story and graphics are excellent . fun , great and cute learning app for the kids .
this app and games are very educational and not difficult . my grandson and i both love this game and app .
in expensive . you can drop in and drop out with out losing progress . fun distraction while waiting for movies , planes , lunch , etc ...
here again , i love bingo games . this is a very pleasant game to pass the time . i usually play it every day .
i get the feeling this may be a battery drain , but it 's great for a laugh and you ca n't help but want to check up on your silly hero .
this is a very good game i play it i like it i love it ... .it is more challenging then the first one .
the game itself is fun , the pop ups are annoying and distracting since they come up during play . i would not recommend this game because of them .
it will keep you entertained for awhile . it is a time management game . a little slow at first but then once you get the hang of it you are good to go . a good kids game .
this game is challenging and fun . it 's nice to play a game that is something different . go ahead , try the game ... you will get hooked !
answers are just as crazy as the real game . sometimes it slow to respond and it seems like the questions have n't been updated in years
i love all the bonus rounds the game is great i have had hour 's of fun thanks for your time and effort you put in to this game..
this will give you so much help picking out books you might like . connect with other readers to see what they think of books before you buy !
this is a great way of story telling . it helps the reader to learn what goes into writing a story .
my nine year old grandson wanted this game . he plays it when he is here visiting and has now mastered it .
i do n't get this game ! it was not at al what i expected and did not enjoy it but it might be what you are looking for .
its a different twist from other games . i have n't quit got the hang of it as of yet but i 'm sure that i will . until then we will see how it goes .
this is a great game , and i have n't gotten bored yet ! although it is tough to & quot ; make friends & quot ; because they are n't listed ...
pretty much exactly what i thought it would be , and is exactly what you think it will be ! solid sequel , nothing over the top outstanding
i like games that will get you to other screens and give you a challenge . so far that has not been the case .
this is a nice clock . it is accurate and does what you want a clock to do . no complaints here .
very relaxing game.. ca n't stop playing , every level is just as exciting as the last one . suggest this game to anyone wanting a relaxing game
i really enjoy this slot game . it is fun and challenging . the graphics are cute and sounds funny . winning is fairly regular .
i enjoyed this game for a while but then got sick have having to have money and stuff to keep going . but the game itself is great .
my 12 year old daughter and i love this game . we have a kindle hd . she is always trying to beat my high score .
i recall a pc game years ago that i loved that was very similar to this and i am glad i found a replacement of sorts . lots of challenging and fun puzzles .
i had n't played the card game spades for years , but was able to review the rules and get right back into it . it is very easy to follow the game . lots of fun .
i 'm stuck on one game and its been awhile , so i 've kind of stopped playing it . but it is a good brain teaser and can really make you think .
its ok. but not the best . be better it you could move around . but overall a fun game . like the graphics .
i think that this game is so awesome i play it all of the time it is so great buy now
this is a great app for free . i couldnt really demand more from a free app . it 's a remote to control your devices from your smart phone with even mouse and keyboard functions .
i have probably played all the bubble games there are and this so far is the best . you can pick your own pace from easy to hard so that is a plus .
this is super easy to use ! especially if fractions are n't for those using it . i would recommend it to others .
not really a fun game i use to play another game like this on line that was much more fun
it is a little limited , but other than that it works most of the time . it is too bad you require so many words for i have said all i have to say .
adobe reader is a great program that allows you to download and read documents on a kindle . a must have ! ! !
i do n't understand how to get past to get past level 5 , plz help . over all i think its a good game so far
i use google for everything i search for , i have no complaints . its easy to use and always finds what i need .
i love that you can dress them up and do there make up and do there hair i love the game .
so far , so good ! and , i will admit this is a challenging game . slightly harder than i thought , but definitely in a good way .
i like this game and think it is very fun except that it gets to be too difficult at the higher levels .
i ca n't put it down . the only problem is the items are so small i had to pull my glasses out .
great interface works well with my kindle . easy to log on and take care of your quick banking needs when on the go !
neat app . good deals and good places . i love amazon and i love them even more because of this app
very fun game & i recommend it to anyone who likes to play bingo . there are so many rooms & types of bingo you can play as well as speed that you want to play at .
love this game , me and my daughter sit and play it together all the time and she really likes it too ! !
i really like it . it 's so much better than the other i 've tried bingos . great game . so glad it 's free !
this is one of the better ones that i have played . i have alot of them on my kindle but this one happens to be the best so far .
everyone was right about this app . there is nothing there once you download it . they want you to buy another subscription .
this app runs all the time even when your not using it . i shut it down and it came back on by itself . look for another alarm .
this game is ok not a lot to do just too much reading no action not like the other games i play
a nice relaxing , yet challenging game ! i play a couple levels each night as i unwind from my day . a favorite !
understand before you get this that it is just a demo and the levels can be beaten in about ten minutes . it 's still fun though
it 's awesome because it 's all ages and you get to have a car and have kids ! ! ! so it was worth it !
super fun and addictive . great graphics and lots of levels . music is good . my wife loves it too . she 's been playing it all day .
i never received this game on my kindle i dont know why i looked for it but never found it on the list i was disappointed when it didnt download please help me
interesting story line so far ... graphics are nice and the puzzles are a good challenge , not too easy . comic book presentation is a great addition .
g5 realy knows how to rope you in . just finished the trial and i 'm hoping that the full version is as good or better .
this game is a great android version of clash of clans . it takes a bit to get going but once you do it is really fun and strategic .
i like minecraft because it is realistic , but this one is kinda stupid . it 's not as great l as the xbox version . but it 's still fun . i highly recommend for minecraft players .
slow , boring , etc etc just another one of those games like farmville super annoying , dont waste your time on this .
this game is a lot of fun , after down loading played for hours and just had a blast fun fun .
because it doesnt work very well . not sure what else to say or do . will try to do it again
i did n't think i would have to pay for everything . it 's not as expensive as buying the book but i would rather go on a free website and read than pay for it .
do n't get this app unless you already had the dragon program on your computer . it was totally worthless to me .
this game is really fun and challenging without being frustrating ! i reccommend this game to everyone ! really worth the price !
i like the variety of games and might even use credits for food etc . the next time i go to a casino . wish i could spend to earn credits more than once a day .
great fun . takes a minute to get the hang of it , but it keeps you on your toes . would recommend it
it 's pretty good for solitaire which gets boring rather quickly . nice and clear and easy to play . would be nice to have other options of solitaire available .
i think it 's fun but would like to be able to get more outfits quicker . but it is still a fun game
fun game . hard to put down . good for any time you have a few minutes to relax . everyone can play this .
i do n't like this app it just did n't meet my needs for what i was wanting to do so i do n't like it much
love that it is available and free on my kindle . still trying to see what stations i want to download . but overall it allows me to listen to the stations i like . thanks .
i got this for my kindle and it is a pretty good game . if you like sudoku , you 'll probably like this game .
like i said above this is a really fun app and also kills time i love playing this game yea so download it
o ya best game ever who cares what the other people say get this awesome game . if u do n't i will find u. haha
this game is great . i mean its simple and fun . so what more can you ask for . the game is free . thats all i need to say .
this is a fun game but i think it 's more fun when u play with a friend and some of the things i have to get right i do n't know what they mean .
this game is so boring for 6 years old people but for 2 year old people it should be fun for them
it 's fun and challenging . when i get done every level , i can just start all over again . months of fun !
i like this game but storage fills up very fast . i would have given it 5 stars if storage was n't an issue . graphics are great !
i really really like this game , grandma . thanks for letting me choose it . i could play with your kindle all day .
bought back a lot of memories from when i was younger . this may be a simple game but will get your mind working . would encourage more parents to let their kids play this game , nothing gets killed
exciting and challenging i enjoy the pictures puzzles and support line mode . it brings the titanic to leave in a new way
this game is not that fun . you get timed and the bomb has to load . it looks fun on the picture but its really not .
like the title says if you only pop balloons for three or four minutes any kid will get board quickly . not much to it besides that .
love this game , fun to play ! enjoy drawing although am not that good at it . glad we have this !
i was doing homework and if i have not had this calculator i would have failed it and have gotten a & quot ; c & quot ; in his class but with this i got an a .
i liked this game it was cool . i like the match 3 style type of games . keep those games coming .
this game is awesome but there 's only one thing i do n't like its 3 bucks ! what the heck were people thinking !
i really really love this game ! ! ! it 's so much fun ! ! ! i love playing it ! ! ! i 'm gon na tell everyone how fun it is ! ! !
this calculator app has been excellent to use . the keys are large and it runs smoothly . very happy with it !
this slot game is so much fun with great bonuses , , , , , , , i wish i could connect to my facebook account but every time that i try to it never connects : (
got this after stars to to see what it was like and it is n't as pretty as the second one but just as much fun
sweet app so cool you can watch it in any were you want to . i love that you can watch disney channel anywhere
i love playing angry birds . all versions . i like to use it as a stress reliever and the fact that it is ad-free is worth the 99 cents
i love the game it is really fun and challenging . i do n't like the fact that i am unable to ask for help from my friends when need help with extra lives .
love love love this game hours of fun even as a family game very fun and well if you bored this will kill the boredom
i love the game mahjong , and this free version is just too fun ! the design is done well , and easy to play !

just love this very much you can do your own pictures and would download this you like puzzles you will love this
i love how easy it is to play , a favorite game from childhood ! i would recommend this game for all ages !
the game itself is very fun but the ads are everywhere , and it gets annoying every time you wan to play
it 's not as good as tiny wings , but that game is n't available on the amazon store so this game will stay on my kindle fire until tiny wings hopefully becomes available .
this is a good solid app . ive just started with it but i like the graphics and the features . you have several tile sets to choose from .
this game helps my son to learn to control the device . you take the bones and like a puzzle match them to the dinosaur . he is playing it now . great game
i did n't like it is too fast to keep up with in my opinion and is not fun to me i suppose i am not a bingo player .
this game is very fun and very addictive ! i love the graphics , the possible combos , and different characters ! great game for anyone !
the game is fun but they need to fix the update issue . other then that it 's like every other game if you do n't want to spend real money you have to be very patient .
my niece absolutely loves playing this over and over again . always hits the hard button , so i wish there was more to do .
this app is so fun and i love that the words are so hard to guess i can be really hard to guess i love that you have to do that
this a really nice game . it is fun to play it and it is really good for the people that love fashion .
i really enjoy these games there is many to choose from once you get them unlocked the graphics are good i tell my friends about how fun they are to play
buy this app it rocks . people say its dumb . do n't belive it . i do n't see how its so bad . awesome app
love this game i love a challange and this has a new one every time and its addicting it keeps me going i like the new app
wonderful graphics , puzzles , and music . it is very relaxing to play and very nice when you do n't have anything to do .
i thought this would be better than it was . sorry i like other bubble games better . this is boring to me
i like the puzzles . i just finished all the puzzles and will have to restart or wait for a update .
this app will surely make your boring days over . this is my time killer when i 'm at the office and nothing to do .
my kids love playing this game . it is challenging , but great for coordination and learning to have a steady hand .
i am a movie buff and i really like this game . i play it with my family who also likes to watch movies especially those we used to watch when we were younger .
challenging , fun and very strategic game to play . love playing with people who like a challenge and yet totally fun to play .
this game is a lot more fun than i expected . you can still have loads of fun without buying stuff with real money .
so far the game is exactly what i like to play ! ! hope it has an interesting ending , and more mini games ! !
i recommend this game to every one young and old . i love these kinds of games . it very entertaining and even educational .
no glitches no nothing ! its perfect ! ! ! love it love it love it ! ! ! ! i adore it . it is so addicting ! please get it ! i reccomend it for everyone ! !
i really like this game . easy to play and great at wasting time . would give 5 stars if cards had auto function
this app drives e crazy , once i start i hate to put it down . i am playing games like this to keep me on my toes plus i like the challenge .
this is a much needed guide to get you thru 100 floors . there are floors that you would n't be able to advance to if you did n't have the guide . glad i got it .
this sucks . i try to install this app but it always has an error same with the tetris game app . i do n't reccommend this app .
it 's just a solitaire app . nothing special . get anyone of these games you want and you 'll see no difference in the game .
boring and no interaction . i deleted it about 20 minutes after downloading it . what a waste of space . could 've been a lot better .
its fun but the only bad thing is , is the energy . it toes forever just to get 5 energy nonetheless . 10 .
very helpful and easy to use . good to help me with remembering what the lord has done for me and that he is always with me .
this game is super fun ! ! i love it so much , it makes me love pizza even more ! ignore the reviews that say it 's bad when its really not .
very cute game . like all the different things going on . fun for anyone . this is a great game to play anytime , lots of great things going on with different levels
not good at all , it not what i was expecting i do n't like it and my grandchildren did n't care for it
t h i s i s. s s s s s s s d d d d d d d d f f f f f f d d d f f f f f
about a minute into the game it crashes no matter what i do . possibly memory size . on kindle . 19 20 .
this is a very good game . fun to pass time with . i think you should get it . its really fun
they do n't give you enough money to play without having to pay for it but the game it still fun
i played this game on the computer and now on kindle fire just great . this game is so . fun and realistic .
i do n't play these games cause they freeze up or do n't have good graphics but this is really addictive its a blast
this game is really cool . it like im on the computer solitaire version . its really fun . you should get it .
it 's ok. pretty easy . be good for the younger children . did n't take long to get through the levels . buy for kids .
my daughters and i play on fairy salon all the time without getting bored . the selection and beautiful colors are the best i 've seen on any of the salon apps
it is a rather boring game , no interaction as everything is in the blind to the player who playing it
this is a fun and addictive game which is fun to play . you will enjoy playing it . great graphics and sound . works well on my kindle .
easy to play great graphics it does deserves a five stars and again i thank u for hours of fun and u people please keep up the great work .
this would be a great game if it did n't start over my game , and every time i & quot ; die & quot ; it wont let me play again !
this is one of my favorite games , i can play this one for hours , very good game and i really like it
i love this game so much that i play it every day ! if you do n't if you should get this app , you should .
it is a lot like minion rush but simpler . my 5 year old loves it . colorful graphics . cute characters . runs smoothly .
this program has variety . i like the idea of getting to pick what i want to see . movies and/or tv series .
it just keeps on force closing . would be good if it could work but it ca n't . nothing like the description .
i like this game very much just wish you could get more lives when you play so you could play longer
its neat to use but does n't work for a lot of the scans . just for fun i b use it for
this game is fun . i just got it and i 'm already on level 2 a lot better than other slot games : )
we love this game ! it 's nice to have the picture matching option for those who are still learning to read . my 5 year old has had fun with it .
i love this app ! your bible , song book , and daily text all in the same place ... no excuse not to read your bible daily !
i have become totally addicted to this game since buying it , i hope there is a limit to how deep you can dig , otherwise i may never stop playing : p
so fun . i love this game . if you get it you will love it . it is one of the best games in the amazon appstore .
i love this game , very kid friendly , fun and addicting . i really recommend it . so easy , any age can play it .
i like this game . it 's one of my favorites and i like to play it all the time with my son . it has a different way of playing bingo .
although it is n't the computer version but it is the best app ever made for on the go it is so fun when on multiplayer . it is worth the seven dollars get it now now now
i thought it was really good till you have to purchase the full game . if were on sale would definitely purchase
while i like the concept of this game , they do not give you nearly enough time . 10 seconds to read and answer is ridiculous . i uninstalled just based on that fact .
i just found this game and love it ! you can win a lot , and i like the sounds ( important to me ) .
i bought this game and played it for a long time ! ( and then i had to take care of my horses ) then i came home and played it till bed .
it is so nice to have this story classic in your collection ! my grandson enjoys it when i read this to him . i highly recommend this to all !
fun and addictive . i love bingo . i can sit and play bingo all day . my kids play it too and they love it .
angry birds is fun , so i 've been downloading everything angry birds , but the space angry birds is quite different . i do n't find it as much fun as the other angry bird apps .
really fun retro gaming . reminds me of the good old days of video gaming . a whole bunch of fun . and it plays really smooth .
this was bought without mom 's permission . but , i 'm sure it was fun .
this game is fun and i enjoy playing it . it 's challenging and fun and my kids like playing it too .
it 's pretty fun but it is also challenging . it was worth buying considering it was a free game . : ) so try it out , its free !
works great . love that the card . goes right to the spot it needs to go when you just tap on it .
very addicting game . just ca n't figure out how to get more dollars . but the game is fun . kinda like farmville .
just downloaded this game and so far it has been fun to play . graphics are great for a hand held device and the action flow is good but not overly challenging ( yet ) .
my nieces and nephew love to play games on my kindle and this one is fun and educational . cute animals and easy games for a variety of ages .
i 've had lots of fun with the fall mahjong app . it is more difficult than other mahjong apps that i have .
i have no problems with this ap . this ap does what it should . much easier to access bank data from the ap than the web .
sometimes it takes too long to find a random player . also , some of the players just write the word on the screen instead of drawing . the game is draw something ! ! !
this app was purchased for my 4 yo grandson . he loves it . 4 stars because nothing is perfect . great for the younger crowd
fun and enjoy a lot ! easy to learn too . anyone and everyone would like this game . great game give it a chance . different modes of finding the hidden objects .
the game is ok. i like it . i have n't gotten to the more challenging puzzles yet , but am looking forward to them .
there is not not much to do in the game . seemed very boring for anyone ! even very young kids thought it to be boring !
really fun and creative for people who love those town designing games but the only problem is sometimes it takes too long to earn money because of how many times you can get some
the game is great and the amount of levels and bonus levels that it has is great for the money keeps kids busy for hours
this is the funniest bingo game that i have played in a long time . i can spend hours playing it .
i really enjoyed this game . it has been very entertaining and keeps me occupied at home or on the go .
short and boring . wish i could get my money back . love hidden object games but not this one . sorry i bought it .
challenging game i do admit it does get boring after awhile but my goal is to find the blue coins but i 'm not sure if their are any .
grandson ca n't figure it out and i could n't either . otherwise i guess it is an okay game just wish they provided more instructions .
great game to spend alittle time on . had fun playing . great graphics . for kindle fire . cant wait to play it again soon .
its fun and enjoyable to play its a good time killer i if you love pets this is app for you
i have downloaded several of the jigsaw apps . this particular app did not appeal to me because of the pictures .
love this . love that u can build your own station and listen to all types of music . keep it up .
actually i was looking for instagram , i guess it is not possible to have it yet on kindle so i just deleted this one since that 's not what i wanted in the first place
i am addicted to this game , sometimes ca n't put it down . great for a time killer in appointments , etc ... . thanks .
i love this game other than it kinds getting too hard then i get bored and do n't even try to solve it anymore . but its fun otherwise .
this is one of the best apps in the world along with all the other angry birds games . great for passing time by .
awsome game have a lot of fun playing the game it works really well on kindle fire hd so i would like to recommend this game to everyone
awesome awesome awesome this game is by far the best slots game out there the bonuses are awesome hourly bonuses could be a little bigger though
i do n't feel terribly challenged or entertained with this game . i am glad it was a free game vs a pay for game .
nothing exciting about this game . it is what it says it is nothing more . not thrilled with the short time limit .
it wont let me buy coins but other than that this game is amazing i love it i cant put it down
it is a very good game if you have the time to play . i think children would like it more . the graphics are okay .
nice logic game . you have to buy your levels but they need to get paid something . fun ideas for puzzles . will play this game more .
this is my favorite game on my kindle ; i play it often . it is complicated enough to make playing it challenging .
i love movies and thought i would give this a try . usually i get bored quickly but i keep going back .
i love this game . it 's a game that makes you think before you make your next move . it also gives you different ways of playing the bubble buster .
this a great app to have . it is entertaining & amp ; fun . a new adventure everytime . i am glad i downloaded this app . my kids really love it .
bad app , dont waste the download space on this one and if you are really curious , do n't get it unless its free .
this app has everything that can be good for an app , graphics , good gameplay , simple controls , and free ! only reason not to like is that it takes a while to install
it has been keeping me busy for hours . i really enjoy the village and making it grow toward the island . lots of fun !
this app is a lot of fun . me and my six yr old daughter both play . i love horses and enjoy how life like . this is .
my boy loves trucks so this puzzle game was great for him . he really enjoys when he gets it all right and the balloons fly .
the graphics are very nice . it is a little confusing one in awhile but i ' e been able to figure everything out so far .
this game is very & quot ; vegas & quot ; without the drive . plays like the real thing . definitely addictive and fun ! i highly recommend this app .
this game is extremely addicting . i play it whenever i get a spare minute , and my skills are constantly increasing . play !
my five year old daughter loves this ! nice distraction when absolutely necessary , and she 's learning at the same time . thank you so much .
it 's a good app but some logos are hard i love to play logo quiz its one of the only games i play
i love these kinds of games . i like not having to constantly build new buildings and stuff like other games . i wish the energy filled up more quickly however .
i play several times a week live . problems with this is you need to spend too much for a & # 34 ; free & # 34 ; game .
this game is very addicting because it test your reflexes and you will try to get a really high score . it 's fun because the character are cool and the different works are really great .
i did n't understand what it said about u and your friends . if u can plz tell me if it is about it would be very helpful .
a fun game and i am enjoying it . i really like the sounds it makes when you make a match !
this game is a great time killer . it keeps your brain active instead of just playing a mindless game to pass the time .
amazing how many games are in this one app . i was only familiar with a few of those offered but it has tutorials to help you learn each game . will not get bored learning !
this game is great on the kindle fire , and has excellent graphics , this is a must have game , don wait get it now
with no instructions on how to set up and just touching the scene changes the settings . i was highly disappointed with this product .
i was always having to log on to my laptop for pinterest and now i can use my kindle fire . thank you sweet god ! ! !
i love this because its totally free . the notifications work great on my kindle fire . a box pops up as soon as i get the message . totally recommend ! ! !
i did appreciate earning the bit coins for the purchase . however it would have been even better to get the application to work in my kindle hd .
this game is ok if you want to keep purchasing coins which i dont and never will another game to take your money is not what people want
i would recommend this game for anyone who wants a kid kept entertained . it works great for fun and great price since was free .
this app is incredible . now when my cousin wants her shows on , i can watch mine at the same time .
just did n't hold my interest . probably ok for many , but just for me . & little words is better . go for it
great game . i love it . it 's fun , intriguing , addicting and can be done for two minutes or twenty . great for passing time while you 're waiting for someone or something .
simple to play card game . another way to pass time when there 's nothing else to do . the screen could be larger .
i love it but it took forever to come up sorry i could not give it 5 but too long
this is definitely the best puzzle game that i have ever played . i look forward to more games like this .
. good thing it was free . got to a certain level and could not go any further without buying anymore coins
i love watching the show , so the game on my 2nd generation kindle fire is awesome ! ! i love it ! ! no glitches or anything . really fun ! !
it is a cool game and easy to play . i would recommend it . it is also enjoyable and peaceful to watch too .
this is a great and funny app . i love the icon . the graphics are terrific and the game play is great . i love this type of game . great job !
i really really really really really really really really really really really love this game it has great graphics and a bunch of fun mini games
after download game would not work on my samsung . it would turn off when i clicked on the play button .
after playing it for about 3 minutes , it got kinda boring . would you rather buy a app that is fun or play a app thats boring ? your choice .
this is a super cute game and not gross at all ! i is just a silly time killer and a fun app to show people even if u do n't play it !
this is an exciting game it is mixed with time and patience . you can play this game when you are bored .
this is o.k . but not enough of a challenge for me . i may try the other more difficult ones when i have time . right now i would recommend this for other people .
if you like this game , then this app is for you . it is very addicting though . it is easy to use , and a fun game .
ok game with nice graphics . but got bored of it after a day or so . not as engaging as other games .
have had this for about 4 months without one problem . great go to game when waiting in airport or elsewhere . you really compete with yourself in a big way .
entertaining for kids or easily amused people . it 's pretty simple . it could use some more options to the app , but it 's entertaining .
great game when alone or just need a quick distraction . easy to play , understand and is not too hard or complicated
this is an excellent game . it may be confusing at first , but you come to love it eventually . i recommend this .
i know found it ! this is the best slots game out there . fun fun ! you win chips like crazy . i 've never had to buy chips , ever !
it 's okay for a bank app . was n't my fav . but now i 'm no longer with them so it 's all good !
i got this app for my great grand daughter , she did not like it . she played it a few times but would quit after a short time . perhaps an older child would like it better .
very enjoyable game just wished it had been a little longer . i did have some trouble finding one of the status but finally got it .
i want the game on my kindle . i do n't need cheats or how to play . i think it should be on my kindle because it is one of my favorite games . please
i love this game . it is the best bingo i have ever had . the whole family loves it love it
forget the free one and just but the full version . it is fun and my kids love it . i think my husband and i play it more then they do .
this game is very fun and very addictive and i would love more games like this . it kind of reminds me of diner dash and that 's my favorite game .
both my children love the interactive part of the story . i had no idea that was part of it but glad it 's there .
this little app is the perfect solitaire game . i have this one and free cell . i have them on the kindle fire hd , and have never had a problem .
yes it was quite a big download but it just works awesome on my phone . just hope they catch up the tablet support . my wife is getting a xoom and loves bejeweled . thanks amazon !
this is a great little app . they did a nice job with it and it works well . if you like backgammon then i 'd highly recommend it .
finally on kindle and free i love this game lots of challenges an fun for everybody i love this game
not worth downloading ! i downloaded this because i thought it would be entertaining and it was not ! not worth it !
it 's a fun game and easy to play . my kids can even help me with some of these . they love this game too ! !
the game is awesome ! ! ! i logged it in to my facebook in another tablet , but when i try to log it on here , it force closes . please fix . thanks so much : )
this is the game for you if you like puzzles and hidden objects . it also lasts along time . i have not found it to be boring at all .
this was fun but definately not my favorite mahjong game . i 'm a more traditional mahjong player & this one was n't what i was looking for .
this game is so fun . some times it gets you so mad that you ca n't beat the levels otherwise it 's pretty fun .
ive always loved this now classic game even when i was playing it on my desktop . do n't like the constant upgrade requests though a bit of a pain .
nice app works well and its a fun game . a great idea too . i like this game a lot ! ! l
get this . it 's great fun and frustrating at the same time . plain straight forward graphics . no need for fancy graphics , would recommend .
i 'm thinking of getting rid of this app . uno is n't easy to use at all . it 's very hard to get the cards to move where you want them .
i enjoy this game daily . my daughter saw me playing this game and called me the next . day to tell me she now plays the game on her lunch break .
this game is great . fast paced and true to the original card game . i would recommend this for all ages .
it is to hard for my grandson to play . i prefer a little more easy navigation for a 3 yr old .
great game for free ... challenging game ... have fun playing at night when starting to relax ... better than most others have tried in app store
pretty fun game , ca n't put it down since i installed it . the other granny games are n't as fun but this one is addicting .
i am not a fan of cnn , and i usually watch my local news , but since thats not possible as i travel i checked out cnn . really interesting and entertaining . well organized app .
my daughter bought this on my kindle and she loves it.. to me its funny watching her play it so much
downloaded this last night and it 's very hard to put down . a great game to play while on the go .
did n't like this app for my kindle fire , there are better ones available . connection issues , and its not on my side .
i love puzzle games . this one is fun and easy . great for beginners . i will look forward to more like this . graphics could be better , but not bad for a free game .
you can prank people when they are watching tv shut it off and when they turn it back off turn it back off . hahaha
this is the awesome app and i 'm only on level 13 please write back to me so you can give me the cheats
i love this game . it is very , very fun and pretty easy . some may be a little challenging but it is great for all ages .
i really was excited to play the game but says i am offline when i have wifi . bummer ! maybe developer can fix bug . i am using a new kindle fire .
this game is so much fun ! i cant stop playing it . why is there a minimum on the review ? oh well .
it was so fun until this ad came and it said buy full version . i exited the game . when i played again , the stupid ad would n't let me play !
did n't play a lot on this one so its kind of hard to rate it but if you like adventure games get it and play .
once you start you can not stop . it is hours of fun for all . down load this and you will be glad you did !
the game is fun but have had better ones to play . wish the & # 34 ; coins & # 34 ; given were given in less time .
i like the game , but after you finish a puzzle it asks if you want to buy it . i downloaded it to play for free .
it was fun for a couple of minutes . i have n't had the black screen but have had difficulties moving birds around . got bored quickly .
it 's okay . it downloaded quickly . this game requires one think through the steps they will take before they take them .
works for what it is , it is n't something i wanted but faotd i own it so i may use it someday .
oh yeah . ty for a cool and fun game ! ! more like this one in the future plz ! ! this game is awesome .
the game is great . if you like games that are calming and can raise dragons this is for you ! also you earn money for completing goals and spend it for your dragons
love this game . if you like puzzle games you will like this . lots of levels of really challenging game play . highly recommend this game for puzzle lovers .
it is so confusing . i do n't get it at all ! can someone explain it to me . does anyone know how to play this game ! ! !
i like this game . it is enjoyable with little to no issues that i have seen . great if you like bingo .
i enjoyed this app . very entertaining and can be challenging . completed the story and cant wait for the second one to come out .
this is a nice game to keep the mind sharp . the graphics are nice and the puzzles are challenging . this has been so much fun .
this game did n't really make sense to me at all . i did n't care for it and neither did my little cousins or nephew .
different puzzle game where you move blocks instead of cut pieces . i t seems easy but gets progressively more complicated . fun time waster !
its netflix , what more is there to say , the app works great and does what is needed . i would recommend you get netflix if you do n't have it .
this is a great game . i really enjoy playing this game . it really keeps you wanting to improve your score .
not much to this little app , but it i enjoy making pretty designs with it . it 's a fun little free app !
just a regular solitaire game . colorful . easy to play which is always useful . i 'd recommend it to those who like cards .
this game is fantastic , i had learned very much . always i play learn about the countries in a incredible way
i bought this app thinking it would be good but i 'll never know . and it makes my other apps slow ! : (
this game was not fun at all . it just was not interesting and boring . the story line was not engaging at all .
fun game , but the aiming seems to be off a bit . kind of hard to manage . but love the game.. everyone should play it .
you make it say what u want it to it is not real you put in what u want it to does not work
i use this with my amazon account to watch the movies i 've purchased . so far so good . trying to figure it all out .
its great for all ages and great for kindle fires ! ! ! ! do n't fall for all the other dumb drawing apps , this is the very best and u will love it ! ! ! !
fun for the whole family . good for kids to try to figure out how the pictures are related . we love it .
it did not work right . i could not get it to download at first and then when it did then it would not work .
i think it is designed ok , but i 'm not much of a casino user . i need something that is more challenging .
these slots are really interesting . even if it was a penny machine in the casino , and paid like this , i 'd play all the time . it is fun .
i love this game . its similar to the zuma game and i dont think its available on kindle hd , but this is the next thing .
this is a great product when you are constantly on the move . i also love the easy to use buttons .
i play this occasionally . it is a good game and i enjoy the graphics . it is worth the money to buy it .
some are hard , but some are really easy . fun for a family event , everyone can work together . i love this app ! !
i really like this app but i do n't always get my message till a hour or two later . please fix this .
time certainly did come ... and go , quickly . it was so easy for me to get lost in this episode that i also lost track of time . logic and entertainment combine to make this very enjoyable .
i love this game because it 's fun . if you like flappy bird you will love this i love it ! ! ! : )
i was very disappointed with this game . i would think for all the time they spent with making the graphics look this nice the game would have been much better . do n't waste your money
i love this game it keeps me guessing and i am a boss at it so yea i definitely suggest this to everyone
i love . this game its so cool and my sisters have it to and the menu button is full and there 's more stuff and you earn more than a 100 mini dollars if u have apple
although it is a simple concept because of the quests it can be challenging . i enjoy playing the game immensely .
great game , nice that you can change it up with some different playing options . only downside is not being able to play against others on line ( unless i 'm missing something ) .
this one is pretty boring , but then again it was free so it seems silly to complain about a game i did n't pay for .
not crazy about it . it was ok , but i do n't play most of the games it mentioned . not enough hints . could have been way better .
lots of different versions and plans to help anyone study god 's word . i love having several versions downloaded to my phone , allowing me to read anywhere .
great game , ca n't wait for the second one to come out ! challenging puzzles to solve along with the mystery . play today .
gran run is so much fun . a highly addicting game . i ca n't put my phone down . amazing graphics and challenging game play . fun for all ages
took a while to get used to but now i love it . it 's awesome for mobile tablets . like being at your desk top .
app made no sense . everything is too complicated . i got it for free , and saved 10 bucks . that is more then this app will ever tell me !
its a fun game and you can waste a lot of time on it . the fighting is pretty cool to . ive enjoyed it so far .
really enjoy spelling with this game ! graphics are cool and sounds are great ! really enjoy trying to spell words for time !
very entertaining ! my 6 yr old loves it and will play it for hours if i would let her ! very cute game
i was playing it thinking it was like minecraft and then when the world loaded the control is way to hard and the animals are always trying to hurt you get minecraft pocket edition it is way better .
me and my baby brother love playing this game and try to figure it out . it 's a good learning game in a fun way . i recommend it to all of you who read this .
while i like this game , i do n't play it very often . it is fun and a great way to pass the time .
looks great on my samsung galaxy note ! it takes a little bit to get the strategy down . . . . . .
my granddaughter and i enjoy playing this game together . she can read now and loves reading everything to me . great game , thanks
this is a very easy game to play , even 4 or 5 year olds can play . i like thats its a two player game .
my daughter loves this . got the idea from my sister yo get this app . her son plays with it to
i think this game is just right -- it is challenging but not too frustrating . music gets old after a while . could you vary ? its relaxing .
my five year old daughter loves this game . she loves doing her own make up and mine , this is great for her . she would play it all day if i let her
you need a direct access program to use this program . if you already have access from another company you do n't need this app . very disappointed .
this game has really good graphics and controls . it is a bit redundant with the gameplay in beginning . i hope it gets a bird better . a different location would be nice .
theres a lot of things u have to spend bucks on and its kinda annoying . not that i dont mind paying
best game ever . also new york is looking hot but they forgot to add a place similar to times square
this is the first time i have tried playing a tetris type of game on my kindle fire . it is okay so far . i am sure i will like it better when i get used to it .
this game is great trivia is always a good time and a very popular app i believe everyone i know plays it .
i listen to this at bedtime , as i have had a sleeping problem for a long time . it really works , and relaxes you ,
it was fun . took a little getting used to playing on the kindle . now i wish i had the 9 & # 34 ; kindle to have a bigger screen .
couldnt get a interest in it was ok. like i say on the games i dont like . nothing against the game , but just wasnt my thing .
the cards are so small and light colored it 's hard to read . i would like it better if the cards were larger
i really like this game . lot of fun using my brain . would make a good game for memory . make people to use their brain .
actually only downloaded it because some other game recommended it . but i like it i wish there were several things different but for a free game its okay !
i like the game its really fun but it wont download i have the light version so get it its fun : )
i was hoping for so much more . uninstalled within 24 hours . not worth your time , but maybe the paid version is better .
the app works about 25 % of the time . i hoped that each reading would be accurate but i 'm still waiting for that accurate read .
not a very challenging game and really not related to bingo , i thought it would be more like traditional bingo
i always have 3 or 4 games going with friends and random opponents . ads are n't even that annoying ! go for it
this is a fun game and yes its takes a long long time to download . be patient its worth the fun .
so much fun . wheel of fortune , but with more time to answer i love that aspect of the game . great to play with facebook friends , or people around the country .
love to play the game it is even on my phone play all the time . easy to play my 5 year old granddaughter plays .
this is different than common slots games which makes it interesting . i have n't gotten near to winning a tournament but i just got the app .
absolutely play daily . love it ! have gotten stuck for days on a level but it 's so addictive i keep coming back for more .
fun to play at least first few are easy . easy to fill in letters could be habit forming . nice graphics
my husband loves playing this game ! he loves how you tilt the kindle to steer ! and the fact that my kinda is hd is a plus .
the more i play the harder it is to stop . i find this a very entertaining game . great picture clues .
gives one a real challenge as there is no way to see a solution before you discover it yourself . i enjoy playing it before going to sleep .
this game is great for challenging you and getting you to think outside the box . the only part that sucks is the in game cost for additional levels or hints .
this is a great game , except for the very annoying waiting for new lives . i have nothing else to say about it , as everyone is already familiar with it !
my two year old granddaughter loves to play this app . appropriate for her age and she is very good with the memory game . keeps the attention of children .
used to play this in early computer days . this version is not a very good quality , but it is free , so that 's okay .
i love this game you can have fun , but you do n't have to spend money to play . something different for a change .
kind of fun , for free . the chase camera could have kept up a better pace than it did , and stayed with the plane .
i find this to be excellent on keeping me posted on scores . their new stories are current and up to date . very helpful !
great game to play at night when you ca n't sleep , or when your husband is watching sports or the man channel .
this is a great game ! it is not too easy , and not that hard . a great way to pass the time .
i bought this game for my grandsons who are all under the age of 10. it was difficult for them to learn and required in apps purchases in order to play . not a good choice for me .
would give a lower score if possible . dumb idea even free is to much to spend . one minute playing this game is one too many minutes of a life wasted .
should be on most top 10 lists . great for fast movie resources and etc . fast to open but some ads become annoying .
the game is fun and gets addictive soon . the graphics are great and very easy to play . i would recommend it for anyone that likes this type of game .
this was also downloaded by my 10 year old son . he seems to use it on a regular basis . it would rate as a like .
its ok but it freezes now and then and makes me have to restart my kindle but i love it so far .
i 'm starting to see a pattern with these games by gameloft . got ta say i 'm disappointed and wo n't be getting another gameloft game until they figure out how to make games work without additional downloads .
i enjoy playing this one , it is relaxing and easy to do , thanks for the extra fun for a old lady !
it was ok for just finding things . was not very challenging . if i wanted to have something to do without thinking i would buy another game like this . it was worth .99 ,

this app is awesome for you kindle fire it helps you keep track of your battery and helps you save energy when you have a little left
this really should be called the stupid app . i do n't know why i downloaded it but i soon found out that it was useless .
it was ok i mean you didnt have to pay after using it for so long but to use it you had to be connected to the internet
angry birds do more than fly , they rock ! yet another great game from rovio . addictive , fun , and challenging . a must play game !
i love angry birds and now know the true meaning of the game . i added star wars version and its the same concept with different scenes . i like it just as much .
this game is too hard , character is too small to navigate through obstacles without constantly dying or having to restart the game
i like this game ... it is not as easy as you may think but maybe my aim sucks . i really like it , it is fun and cute .
i downloaded this for my 6 year old granddaughter . it keeps her busy on long car rides and while waiting for appointments . she loves it .

great game . lots of fun . keeps you busy and interested . nice graphics . love the original and love this one just as much .
it seems easy enough . i do agree with others that you should n't have to buy levels or buy hints but so far i have not had to use any .
this is not espn 's app for the website , but it is there app for news and scores . you are able to customize with your favorite teams .
this game is okay , has enough changes to keep it ok for awhile if you win enough not to have to pay for coins , which i would not do ...
have not used it much , but i like it.i have been able to catch my favorite shows so far , but i am sure that i will use more in the future .
i try out many different games . i decided to try this one and have been pleased . it 's great for passing time and simple to play .
there were way to many interruptions for the demo of the game to be enjoyable . i deleted it on the first day .
this product is not what i expected , nice and attractive cover , but has no functionality , and does not give any extras in return . i deleted this app from my kindle .
it is a little weird , it changes worlds & if your not paying close attention you wo n't be able to pick it up
this game had potential but the game play is very limited . even with the purchase of special spending points boredom sets in quickly if your not 10 or under .
my new favorite game - so much fun and quite addicting ! it 's like being a kid again playing the dozer games at the carnival
this game is pretty fun and has food graphics the one thing i do n't like is that there is no exit button otherwise would be a 5 star in my book .

time flies by cuz your sucked into this game it 's fun i would definitely get and recommend this game to anyone with time to kill or bored

... ca n't stop playing it . one of those games that you think of all the answers right after the game ! good fun !
this app is very fun and entertaining . the games cost lots of points but i still give it a 5 because of the the games .

i think this game is good and i think it is a great game . i really enjoy it a lot .
this game is extremely fun and easy to play . i recommend it for anyone who just likes to play a game .
i like being able go access my mail from my mobile device . it makes it convenient when l do n't have easy access to my computer .
can not give a good review because in order to proceed u need to buy within game . this should be stated up front imo . and what the $ will be !
best free app you can get ... have been getting my news at late night and earlier morning ... video portion works great too
i need this to use the camera on my kindle fire hd . it 's good for other things like taking you to your photos , etc .
the free game needs to be longer . i barely started playing before it started making me do reviews . give a few more levels .
this is a really good game . i have been play for a while and have had no problems play it . it 's also good for kids not thing bad and simple .

i like minecraft but this app needs armor and lava . and creative is nothing like pc creative . but its still cool .
this is a really fun game i love it so much my sister my brother my dad my mom and i love it very much .
then you need a battery monitor . there are hundreds of apps like this , but this one is , by far , the best , most accurate , one available .
i ca n't wait to play the 2nd one ! ! very addictive ! did n't want to put it down !
i love it its really addicting and it is very similar to flappy bird and it is challenging which makes it a very great game
just downloaded this and i ca n't stop playing . it 's a nice little brain teaser to make you think . lots of fun
so cute i cant stop just going in and listening to them sing . very soothing actually for a game . very fun
i have heard that this game is a lot of fun to play for all ages , but we could not get it to do anything on our tablet .
i like it . it is a game that anyone can play . young or old . i have fun just trying to beat my own score .
this game is entertaining and all around good fun . lots to do and fun things to customize your bakery with , plus lots of different recipes . i adore playing teamlava games !
i really love these apps ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! this is the best game ever . i love this app . this is great app . cool .
i did not like this hidden object based on the other hidden games i have played on my tablet . i uninstall it off my tablet the same day . just could not get into it like other games .
this gives you the basics for drawing . i have no drawing skills at all but enjoy drawing .
it 's alright for a short time was actually thinking about removing it . did not like it well enough to keep my .
this game is really confusing . needs some work . i would n't recommend this to anyone . upgrades and make it a little less confusing .
my 7 year old wanted to download this app because he 's such a huge fan of mind craft and because it was a free download i allowed him to and he loves it !
the kids like this game . they have been playing the game since i got it . they love it . thank you .
nice . it has some good games that is enjoyable for all age 's . so it is a pretty good game except for the ads .
great graphics , good speed , wonderful on my kindle fire , and very entertaining ! would recommend this bingo game to any one of any age .
this app is necessary to open certain documents and files . it is a no brainer to get this free app for your device .
its ok but i got really far , then it would n't let me catch one so i could n't move on . so ya
love it is my favorite game i play it all the time . : ) : p : d thanks for this app .
great game to teach the kids how to care for their pets ... grandchildren from ages 2 to 6 love playing this game ...
love this game . i have alot of mahjong games & amp ; this is my favorite ! ! wonderful graphics ! great to pass a rainy day with . worth buying ! !
this app does the job i need it to do . simple calculator app that allows you to go back and look at prior calculations . very useful .
i like this app because it comes in handy when i do n't have a piece of paper handy while i am out .
i barely ever buy apps but i am happy i bought this one . runs clear and smooth and not glitchy . great for kids ! i know this is going to be a new favorite for my kids .
i would love this game if the diamonds could be earned instead of requiring money , or if the rooms needed less energy . otherwise i quite enjoy the game .
this was not what i expected . it was more for one or two year old .
i like it so far the themes are fun and it is like most bingo games good to pass the time
great and entertaining game ; i have fun each time i play it ! it has three different levels of challenge which i like .
it is a boring game so do n't waste time in downloading . it held my 7 yr old sons attention for about 10 minutes .
nice ! ! i can download mp3 from videos for free ! ! ! yay ! ! ! anything on youtube . its easy and quick . love it . no viruses ir anything ...
it 's okay but i get no sound with it . i have the regular version on my pc everything is the same but no sound
very nice graphics . lots of variety and relaxing game to play . the finished pictures are really cool , and pretty , and satisfying .
another game that was down loaded on accident its free and i think my son thought it would be fun
this game makes you think . it is very entertaining . i will recommend this game to everyone i know . thank you .
this game os so good i could play it all day and night the graphics are so good it feels like your in the game its so amazing
all i have 2 say is wow . i mean this game rocks it is a great game for like ages 10 to like 40 .
fast , fun and easy to play . keeps my kids entertained on long trips . they even manage to work together on tougher puzzles .
i downloaded this item and then never played it . i have removed it from my device . i do n't recommend it .
works well on kindle fire . great pics , you can make it easy or hard to solve puzzles as you wish .
this is the best game ever ! ! ! ! i play it every day ! ! if you have n't gotten it yet , get it right now ! ! !
this game is fun but it is very bad you have to buy stuff . it is in possible to get coins .
this is n't as easy as you may think . lots of fun and pretty puzzles to put together . lots of fun for everyone . love it .
hate it ! it 's boring and not worth the time it takes to down load . i would not recommend this to anyone .
its fun and all nut its just that as soon as u get the point u barely want to play it anymore so its fun i guess
i love this game . the only downside is after every few turns i have to exit out of an ad . other than that it is very entertaining and works well on my kf hd .
i love this game and its fast pace . i am so addicted . i cant put the kindle down . i told all my friends about it .
no insane running back and forth , good storyline and great puzzles . my favorite so far ( of the 20 or so played )
fun , but another wait a year to get something done or pay pays with real cash to buy coins , food , and etc .
i got this for my grandson . he loves the game and plays it as soon as he comes over
you have to get it the grafics are way better and its just awesome al my friends are playing it and ya so ... ... .
i just installed this and so far it is super fun . i think i will get a lot of enjoyment out of it ! and it is free !
good game , g5 makes some of the best hog games out there . tho do n't like having to take 25 words to explain that its a good game ,
this is a very good game . i like this game . it was as they had described it . it was fun to play this game .
i have no problems at all . my mom and i love this app and we play it every single day . it 's one of our favorites .
would not let me download ! ! i was so excited for this game but now i cant be excited cuz i cant even gt the app
for a free game it is great . it is simple but still engaging . my only complaint is that your energy runs out too fast .
so much fun . you have to get this if you like jigsaw puzzles . you will love it . there 's something for everyone .
this app may be terrific . but it is such a space hog , can not be moved to the sd card , that i simply did not have room on my smartphone to try it .
lot of fun , good time killer . with the upgrade system , ill be playing for a while . one of the best free apps of the day , and would be worth paying for
this is one of my favorite games . it is challenging and rewarding and you can play with all of your friends .
fun game , but i got bored easily with this game . it may be fun for others , but just not a huge kindle gaming .
not much to say about ... i ca n't get it to run on my kindle . did manage to draw a picture but is about it ... it keeps crashing ! : (
i 've never played mahjong before but found this very easy to learn and start playing after a 30 second tutorial . also looks great on my kindle fire .
this game is addictive and is so enjoyable to play . you do n't get tired because the game board is always changing .
this is a pretty fun game but it can not be played without a wi-fi connection . if you 're on the road , forget about playing this game .
the game is good , my only problem is having to either buy or unlock stuff , besides that the game is really fun to me
usually love hidden objects game , but i uninstalled the game within an hour after installing it . pop ups of other things continually during the game !
i have to agree with a lot of the reviews . i thoroughly enjoyed this game ! it was a great length , had some challenge but not too much , and interesting . i def recommend it .
this game is really fun so far . the only problem i have with it is it slows down a little when you click on something and you will probably need real money to play it
this game is awesome . i love that you can zoom in and out to get a better look at the entire screen . i highly recommend this game to anyone .
i love this game . it 's so addicting . 5 stars . i ca n't put it down . by far my new favorite game .
i ca n't let it go , i keep wanting to solve each puzzle . its fun and very interesting and informative . good fun
i found that this game is not much fun and do not play it now . i just like to read to much to play many games .
this game is very cute . but it is slow and expensive . if you ca n't play everyday then do n't even try this one .
it took me a while to get the hang of this game but once i did i was hooked ! the app was easy to download and the graphics are fantastic !
i have not had a chance to use this app . i believe it will be helpful . i like the idea of video chat . this app is being used on my kindle .
works fine but wish the numbers were larger . just wanted something simple to use and this is it , but the numbers need to be larger .
if you are addicted to bingo games , this is one you got ta have . way too much fun for a single game .
this game feels like you are playing real bingo at the casinos . i 'm really happy i downloaded it . i love it .
my friends and i play this game , it is great and hard but you come out of it with more knowledge then when you went in .
i am unable to give this app a real rating . it was in your apps for the kindle fire hd , but i never received it .
i tried it but some of the jokes are no funny to the people i tried the jokes to . so you need to change some jokes
i really enjoyed this game . story was good , and so we 're the graphics . loved the & quot ; shooting & quot ; mini games for something different . would buy a part two .
i loved this it was so fun to play i just loved it that is all i can say awesome game
used it for wake up while on business , worked great . love the different faces i can use , and light levels .
this app works smoothly and provides all the information at half time and final results of each game . try it next year , it should even be better .
great game to pass away time and fun for the whole family ! we have several of the hidden object games but this one is our favorite !
this app was great . the color and the sound and the hidden objects were a challenge to find it took some thought .
you have to be online to play do not like that at all ! ca n't play if you are somewhere you do n't have wifi .
this is a fun game as most know easy to play and it takes you back to the old days when pac man was a way of life . give it a try ... ... worth the price .
i did n't finish downloading this one since it uses a lot of memory and i only wanted to use it with my grandson for the day so i used the talking tom app instead .
just get it it is the best i love it and it is my first day playing it so get it
this was my first attempt at sudoku and i liked the form very much . it kept my interest and was enjoyable to work . this is good for a beginner to start with .
i love this game so much . i play it all the time when i am bored . i am close to unlocking all the characters . i recommend this game for everyone .
i think this game sucks but you people like it so ya its ok i just do n't like it there 's no point of this game but other games are better
i could n't get this app to load on the kindle fire hd it had beautiful pictures but not able to get them
really enjoy this game . i love that there are special dragons . they cost gems but you can also breed them and save the gems for other items . best game like this that i have played
same as all the gem match three games , but just as addictive . you will have fun whether it 's your first time or you 've played them all .
it 's good but boring ... . new update please ! and to addicting . do not get this game ! because if you get it you will get bord !
i think who ever put one star for this game was completely out of their mind . this game is one of my favorites .
this game is one of the best game i have ever played it keep ur mind going , great great yay
this came in handy when you needed help to solve some levels otherwise you would n't be able to move on .
this was more advanced than i needed . i thought it was for beginners . my mistake , deleted so i could make room for something else .
i enjoy word to word but i have wanted more difficult sets . this theme package does it . now if they 'll just make more .
it is soooo addicting because when you start it helps you out a little and you get to breed and buy your own monsters , and make sick beats
i have not used this app that much but ca n't wait until i need to use it and see how it works . will write a better review then .
good game , v addictive . adds are a bit of a pain but thats the price of it being free i guess
this is one i am glad i downloaded and play often , if you like puzzles give this one a try , fun music and cute graphics : )
this app is a total waste of space . i got this app and it crashed my kindle fire ! do not get this app !
this game is the best game for kids . they will have so much fun playing the this game . when i got it i would not stop playing
i do n't like that you have to buy you energy and hints . otherwise , it 's a good game in that you can pick it up or turn it off and anytime .
i like this game it is alright i rated it 5 stars because i needed an extra help on the game . it is kinda challenging .
i really enjoyed this game ! it was very addictive and the graphics are excellent . the only complaint i had was the lack of instructions on the use of the tools .
until you do n't open an account the access is difficult , you need first to have an account with netflix ! otherwise can be interested to have specially if you are stock in airport !
i was a huge fan of the might and magic series ( a few more too ) . this game takes me back to those good memories . thank you to the dev .
i really enjoy word link . i feel it is challenging to get it the first time . yes , i would recommend it to others . i do think it is a fun app .
i just learned to play this game , the app is helpful for learning strategy , but it is fairly easy to win . a little more challenge would earn this app five stars
i do n't understand . why some bad reviews . been playing every moment i have time . excellent little game . highly recommended . 5 stars all the way
get it get it get it if u have a twitter it is awesome and it works great i think everyone that has a kindle should get one ! !
absolutely amazing bingo game to play when you are allowed free time . i could not think of anything more fun while stuck inside during a snow storm .
yeah , you only get three things for the kids to use unless you buy the upgrade . instead of free should say trial .
oh , i have been playing this gin rummy game way too much since i downloaded it . it is fun and no glitches . it works perfect and so fast . i have really enjoyed this game .
this starts out simple but you quickly have to start using strategy as well as just matching things . challenging and very enjoyable !
does not appear to work one kindle fire hd - wish i had know that before i spend the time downloading to nowhere .
i downloaded this as my screen saver . fun to feed the fish and easy to make changes when i want to . nice hassle free fish tank ... grand daughter loves it .
it 's okay is about right . not a feel good kind of game . lots of bells and whistles but not much else .
the app does n't always load correctly , but when it does i can get lost in it for hours . for the most part i recommend this to anyone who like to just browse the internet .
this is an awesome app if only i could win like some of the other player 's , that would be wonderful . there needs to be more daily credits given out , you go thru them too quick .
love this game . love playing with friends . like keeping sharp on words . like being able to chat as well as play a game .
my sons and i loved playing this . we reached the top level and now are just waiting for more . thanks for good memories .
it 's an interesting game but when you get stuck , you are stuck . no hints or helps that i could find .
loads without problems on my kindle fire . so far i am having fun but i just started as well . i hope it is all it says it is .
a fun game to waste time . some challenging levels . lots of fun if you enjoy bubble pop games . recommend for all ages .
not as much fun as i hoped for . no passes if you ca n't get the answer . so it 's necessary to & # 34 ; buy & # 34 ; coins if your stuck .
this app is also a very good step by step guide and i really love it thanks to the people who made this app
this is a pretty good game for the smaller kids grandkids really like it something i can play with them
i do not like games that make it so , that the only way to play is online . it does not give you a chance to practice .
if you are looking for a time filler , this game is a good choice . only thing i would change is the ability to make screen larger .
what looks like a quick no brainer just keeps getting faster and more difficult and this requires great thought faster fingers .
this game is a lot of fun . i just wish you could skip and go back to when you 're having trouble .
i have removed this app from my device . the app rarely worked right and i just did n't find it worthy of my time .
this is an easy game to play and it is fun if you are not looking for a big challenge .
this game for girls is fantastic ! it 's super easy to get money and cash . the prices are just right and are totally worth it . i ca n't get my face off it . it totally rocks
no stars i do n't care i put 1 i make it 0 it would not come off if you get delete it right away or you will be stuck with it forever ! ! ! ! !
this is one of the best kindle fire apps for a piano ! you can change the keys to make different sounds !
if you love word search games , you have to get this app . very easy to use and you will learn a some interesting facts about other countries . love it !
not sure if i liked it . tried to delete it from my kindle when it mentioned something about buying more levels .
good game with a lot of variety and frequent bonuses . compare to other games this is an excellent idea . really enjoy playing this game
i like it . the push to try to get you to buy coins is annoying but it is a good game .
if you need a reason to buy this game , it 's because you 're clearly interested enough to read the reviews on it . great way to spend $ 0.99 .
you ca n't do anything but look at a single screen . you ca n't swipe to a new one and you ca n't interact with it at all .
this game is so fun and addicting . the spot to move a card to use later makes the game fun . you think you are losing and suddenly you clear the board . highly recommend .
i should have known with such good ratings this was going to be fun . my husband just downloaded it after watching me play .
this is a fun app but too many ads . in arcade mode sometimes you have to close the game and open it again just to see your score . i have to do it every day ! ! !
great but sometimes freezes up . also only gave 5 stars cause i get free coins . still like the game though . needs to be less pricey .
great mind thinking game , even though on some levels i had to look up how to solve it . most are just time in solving .
this game is ok. i play it while i 'm waiting to earn life 's on other games . pretty much the same tasks throughout the game .
great fun game to play . it really works your brain out , and gets you use parts of your brain you didnt know you could use .
i do n't like a lot of the popular games . i prefer the ones that make me think . so far this is simple but fun .
this game is so vivid in color and graphics , love playing it ! very addictive and fun to try and get a higher score , i would of paid whatever was asked to get this app !
this is an excellent game actually one of my favorites the only problem i have with it is it crashes on a regular basis other than that i highly recommend it
addicting game and lots of fun . hard to put down once you start playing . it is better than a lot of the computer versions that i have on my computers .
this helps with reading as well as thinking on your feet . some of the word combos do n't make since at first .
even though the app was free i did n't realize it had so few levels . played them all in no time .
i 'm surprised its not more popular . i use it with my kindle fire and it works awesome . i would rate this one million stars if i could . it is my new favorite game
i love this game ! i play it so much that i have it on my kindle and my smartphone . play daily .
the calculator is nice to have it is very good because it works great but i had to delete it
it okay . its about how fast you can spell and find words . my kids play it often . its a race against the clock .
there are better free games out there with more interesting play . the sound is not very appealing either . do n't bother to waste your time .
i dont see many games on here i think it stinks i dont think its fair that we cant get the same games or close to it as online
great game it made me think something most games do not do . bring on more please . make them even more challenging an longer
it took a little while to get the hang of the game & amp ; now i seem to be hooked . young kids can play the easy levels but the more difficult levels my be too hard .
this app is ok , but does not seem to be as detailed as when i use it on my computer . it works well for what i need it for though .
this is a very fun game . you 'll have hours of fun finding out these cool movie title clues . check it out !
this is a really great match three game . i love getting the egg . i would highly recommend this match three game .
it 's candy crush , need i say more ? fun , challenging , and an all around great way to kill some time . love it ! !
its okay but not the best . sometimes it lags and it gets very annoying ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! : ( overall its okay but still not the best all ever .
just a game to pass the time away . it will make you think before you make your move . all in all a good game
pretty lame game , no challenge to this game at all . it is pretty boring . i deleted it . get a better match 3 game
pretty cool puzzle game . only just started playing it , so time will tell , but do far so good ... i will update if any issues
very cute lets u do lots of cool things ! ! really cute icons ! really cute ! ! good for any ages ! ! ! ! ! ! hope i could help ! ! !
its good but could be a little more difficult other than that its ok so its not bad i think
this is a fun and easy game ... .you will be surprised at how many movies you actually know . a good way to pass time .
it 's a fun game and u have to do a lot of thinking and it gets hard when u get on certain levels

a little expensive ... i like hidden object games , which this was missing . also i could not get the alternative ending to play . : (
my little one plays this app for a little while but there is n't a whole lot to do on this app . it is more for just making noise .
game is ok not additive just ok its worth 99 cents but not much more . will i play it again yea maybe .
this is a nice game to pass the time . it can be as simple or as difficult as you choose .
ca n't seem to put it down , love it ! ! ! such a great time passer ! very addictive . definitely not sharing this game with my husband !

i love solitaire and this is one of my favorites . spend a lot of time on this game . relaxing game to play .
i believe this game got me started on an angry birds addiction . the games are challenging and fun with loads of different backgrounds to keep it interesting .
one good think is you do n't have to worry about . changing the water . i like the different types of fish you can choose from . i think i might keep this game .

this app is lots of fun to play and a lot of cool power ups and sound effects to keep you going . i really enjoy it the shooting is cool too .
the best sleep i have gotten in a very long time its an app that has saved my morning life .
thought the price would give you some other features such as maybe real people but this game is only 99 & cent ; on the apple market .
i have lots of of fun playing this game . i was not to good when i started but i am getting better . it is just a lot of fun
good game maybe not 5stars but giving 5stars to obtain walkthrough . i love escape games so have added to my collection
this game is fun but needs an update with more categories other than that its some good old fashioned fun
this is a good way to stimulate the brain , work on memory skills while having a great time playing this game .

great game . it makes you think . even something simple can sometimes be hard to figure out . i love this game .
this is just a demo so you buy the games . so much is locked it is not even worth downloading .
been waiting for every for it to update the app taking too long to update they need too hurry up but other wise it 's a great app
i guess it 's not my type of game and i end up having to buy hints ? ? ? thats kinda dumb if it 's a free app .
what 's the point of the game it is horrible you never get any dresses or important things that you need on it . why would any body love the not free stuff
i dont have internet at home so it does me no good . it was nice while the little credits lasted , but i just didnt like it enough to keep it .
i really wanted to play this game but again it was another app that would n't install into that stupid android ... .
who does n't love a good find the difference game . i continue to play this game and have n't encountered any issues . would rate higher if it included more pictures to search from .
it great when your not home and you want to watch a movie on your laptop and my kindle fire .
in this version , you can get different bird colors for making reviews , and you can even make your bird poo . : d just as good as flappy bird , maybe even better .
have played quite a few of these types . this game was tedious . too much dialogue for very little game play . did not complete it for this reason .
i enjoy playing this game . objects are hidden fairly well . however , myself i prefer just a little more challenging hog . i got it free so no problem !
very good ho game . i loved it and now my 6 year old is playing . nice variety of puzzle types , story line , and challenges .
it is a awesome game for an american if you are chinese you will not understand why ? you ca n't read the words it is funny !
if you are a curious person like me , and would like to map stars , this would fit !
hard but fun need a way to earn hints and stuff give a little more hint so the person knows or can figure it out
it 's an easy game but it passes the time and is a good way to relax . it 's also fun to play with other
i love puzzles of any kind , but this one is a little different which was a pleasant surprise , ca n't wait to put more puzzle together ... .
i ca n't believe how amazing this game is ! ! ! i have played some good games but this one is my favorite .
this application is fantastic . three words is great to play . i would recommend this game to friends and family . super concept .
old school arcade racing . a blast from the past . i love it . my 3 yr old cousin loves it too !
i can get rid of apps , uninstall , free junk memory and get memory boost , very useful all in one tool
this is a very addicting game . it makes you focus , think , respond . it is simple , easy to use and high quality photos .
i think this game its great . they try to make it like real life somewhat , when you play you might understand that .
this game is the best game ever and i just love it and it makes my life so fun . my mom does n't even know that i have this game .
not bad . you need to purchase hints & upgrades but it can be played without hints . mix of levels of difficulty but mostly challenging .
this is okay it a little hard for little people over the age of five or maybe younger it 's too fast .
awesome totally fun ! i started to play it an i could n't stop ! take my word for it because if do n't u will see what your missing out on ! great time passer & lt ; 3
i really like this version of spider solitaire . it is easy to play , even on small screens , and you can win most of the time .
this game is very fun it 's one of the best games i have ever played but i rated it 4 stars because i think the backgrounds look stupid
one word to describe it & quot ; entertaining & quot ; always something to do i ca n't complain at all download right now . before it 's too late lol
i want to get the new cartoon network app . i want the new app because you can watch video and play games . dont get this app .
i can hardly wait to play it every day . it definitely is challenging and fun . i appreciate the fact that it is a free game .

just right . not super hard and not so easy you get bored . let 's you keep trying until you get it . makes you think , especially when you do n't know the song .

i love pinterest ! it 's a little slower loading on my kindle fire compared to my laptop but i could still sit on it for hours .
i think it 's great ! the games are addicting but that is only because you are constantly trying to beat your previous score . i have noticed some mental improvement . thumbs up !
this game sucks it 's not even fun . there 's no racing all you can do is drive around also it 's very boring and stupid i regimens not to get it ! : (
i check this everyday for the weather and i love it ! i have it on my ipad and my android also so i can check the weather all the time
this is a good game as long as your chips last . i wish there was a way to buy more chips with the coins you win rather than having to buy with real money .

my daughter 's and i all love this game . it gets fast quickly , so it may be harder for younger kids after a while . fun and entertaining .
i downloaded this app for my daughter and she still seems to enjoy it . it is a very cute game and the animals within the game are adorable .
love it . no issues on my kindle fire . lots of fun . if u like where 's my water , you 'll love this game too .
fun to see how long it takes to complete puzzles . it is great for keeping the brain active and have fun doing it .
i really enjoy this game.it has a lot of different and interesting objects . each level has different objects , so much fun
but it crashes on my phone , and was unresponsive with use of swipe controls ... might be just me , or could have just been my phone itself ...
this game is very awesome . they give you chances to get more points by doing certain things . the games cost more points as you increase levels .
great game and very interactive . you do have to use some actual money to continue the fun but if you love music as much as i do then it is worth it !
its caused me to fail but it is a great game i recommend it to you . just to fill space to post
it 's a great game , but it 's a little hard for me because of the 3rd hole . overall it 's a good game but it 's that 1st level 3rd hole .
yes there are a lot of other apps that do the same thing , but skype is still my favorite , for both personal and professional use .
when growing up , i use to love watching the the price is right and still watching it till this day . this app brings back memories and i love playing it .
great game . it really makes you think . i wish there was a hint or clue for when you get stuck .
easy to use on your tablet . much better than using the browser . ability to find and use coupons a real plus .
i loved this game . great graphics , creators please create another one with even more challenges . loved the 3d aspect of it as well . do n't pass this one up .

i am enjoying the game . i find it hard to put down and will recommend to friends and family . great game and it is free .
i am not a good judge of this one . i ca n't give an accurate account of this game if i do n't play it !
do not like the function icons on the puzzle board and the screen moves and the can not sort the pieces to the side all at one time . also the puzzle can not be saved for later .
i cant believe that finally the ad free version of this app is finally free . i was wanting to buy the ad free version but now i can get it free ! thank you amazon

so far ok. about as good as 3. was hoping for more . maybe as i keep playing ... until i get bored . need more options tho .
it 's a fun game to play . the characters are so real looking . the graphics are awesome . i recommend it to everyone .
i have not played this game i probably got it for when my nieces and nephews come over
this is a game you can play and feel like you never really get anywhere . no achievements . it 's just boring !
i love the way this works better than the gallery app . i can see photos in the order that i want to see them in , and it works quickly !
this game is almost addictive . the girls compete playing at the same time . it helps keep peace in the house .

very fun game 8 yrs or older , but items cost too much money for what the people make . also we wanted a big family and cant seem to get one .
this is a wonderful game . each level is a different challenge and every level is totally different . i really get frustrated sometimes playing but in the end i just love paying it .
it seems to take a longer time switching from screen to screen and much more old school slot style . its fun but not so much exciting .
what a great game . i love it . it is intense and fun . i was pleasantly surprised when i first tried it . i recommend it .
this game is awesome 5 star person here i love this game so much i wish for two things only 1 for a new update and 2 i wish it was a bit cheaper
jewels & amp ; diamonds is the newest definition of addiction . great game , graphics are awesome and i am sure that all that play the game will find it just as fun to play as i do .
did not like this game . hard to see the numbers in some places . not clear on some of the instructions .
i enjoy puzzles that are not too complicated , and the free puzzles are just my speed . also , you do n't have to worry about dropping the pieces on the floor !
i 've enjoyed playing this game for a very long time now . keeps your mind going if you 're in a boring situation . works great on the tablet .

i love it . it is so cute you get to do so much stuff and build cool stuff and make your hotel be a success . i rate it five stars it will be worth your while download now
this app is not really meant for the kindle tablet . it is a google app and is somewhat hard to use !

i 'll be getting the paid version after playing this today . not super hard but a challenge that does make you think .
it 's fun but gets kinda boring after a while . it 's fun the first 20 minutes after that , it 's just a time waster .
this works great . i dont have alot of apps on my kindle but this one is a must if you have hbo .
the game is awesome and fun you should try it . it 's sick and some are hard depending on how old you are
just got the kindle fire as an early christmas present and of all the game apps ive downloaded this one is my favorite so far : ) def worth the money
this is a really good app it works very well it has never crashed on me + make your own little movies i recommend getting it !
this game is so short . you only get to do one customer and then the game is over ! i 'm not saying do n't get it i 'm just saying be ready to get disappointed : ( .
great app , i love to take pictures and try to edit them . so this app really helps me out . i love this app totally worth your money .
i really never used to like solitaire until i started playing this game because you can level up and select different kinds of solitaire . i would definitely recommend this game to anybody that loves card games .
i just started and only thing i need is more hints ... .i love these kind of games and hope i can figure it out .
kind of boring to me . i played it once and got bored , so do n't play it anymore . not very exciting .

it a fun trying to get to point to point to make it work , it fun and mind boggling sometimes good job
fun , fast , no long wait for next game to begin . easier to win than other bingo games.i would recommend this game to all who like playing bingo .
it stops on me at times . the app does tend to stop working and you have to reboot the game again .
the app froze about half way through . i was really enjoying it . and i am very disappointed . why do these things happen ?
this game was really cool ! good storyline . awesome graphics . really good puzzles along with the hidden object games . a winner in my book : )
its probably good for people who know how to put it to use . but i dont , i downloaded it and still cant get video on my kindle hd
i ca n't find anything to complain about with this app ; it is easy to use and very useful . a perfect calculator .
this is a fun app especially on a road trip . some of the shows seem a little obscure , as though they are old or were only on cable , but still fun to play .
fun for the holidays , i got it for free . i would n't have paid for it though . but if you have young kids it 's probably a nice book to have
my 5 year old enjoys this game quite a bit . easy to play and understand .
this game looks like it would be fun as i love candy crush but for the life of me i can not get it to open on my kindle ! ! glad it was free
great game and extremely addicting . i do n't know if it 's because it 's free but it is a bit glitchy and the constant advertisements are soo annoying but it 's still fun .

my daughter loves the panda games . they are simple and entertaining . she would want them all if i would be willing to buy them .
all of it is free it has not asked me to & quot ; buy the full version for more content & quot ; its great !

this is a fun game not only for kids but for adults . i like how you can turn the sound on and off also .
it is a fun game the family can all enjoy , and is true to it ` s description as advertised . the fish and scenery are very well done
not really for me . was not what i was looking for . was n't what i expected from a slots program . deleted it from my device .
this app is very frustrating so i can barely focus on the actual game . it freezes a lot and is really annoying . do n't get this app . it is a waste of your time .
it seems like this would be really easy but it gets quite hard . but it is fun and time consuming .
nice job with this one i really like this the best out of all of the angry birds games . very cool .
awesome game a little hard awesome still only one bad thing that you have to buy packs but since its free and o ads definatly worth it
what can you say about solitaire . you either enjoy playing it or you do n't . i enjoy playing it so this is a good game .
the game was ok , but after a while it got a little boring . i 'd still recommend it to anyone who likes the slots , but i deleted it after an hour or so
i could never get ahead on this slot game so i deleted it after 2 weeks of trying it and have n't missed it on my tablet .
i do not use this app daily , but it is another resource among several that i have chosen . no complaints .
easy but you got ta pay for your extra items but other than that its fun to take the time away
i love this app because it is minecraft and i love minecraft it is fun it is great for all ages get this app

it 's ok nothing exciting about it makes the time pass by , needs more to it to make it exciting . thanks
the game played well on kindle fire . no problems and puzzles were challenging . hint and skip buttons work very well and navigation through game is easy to get . price is worth it .
a bit easier on my computer than my kindle but still fun . try it and you 'll probably enjoy it . have fun .
i enjoy playing this kind of game . i wish there were more levels available for free and it did n't end so quickly .
pretty challenging game but really fun it is quite easy on some parts however it can be hard to beat
this is a fun game if you like word games . you learn new words , and play with friends . it 's a easy paced game that you do n't have to rush at .
i 've been looking for something like this since i got my android phone . easy to use . nice design . easier than typing when you need to write fast . overall very useful .
makes you really think about word connections . play it with my 9 year old boys and they enjoy it also .
you need to get more of these type of apps . they are awesome and again a good story line
awesome game . okay graphics , but they are not allowed to show actual peoples faces so i guess that 's why . totally worth it
i really enjoy this game . very cute and somewhat challenging . i only wish that gold was easier to come by without spending money .
i watched ( sometimes helped ) my daughter playing many cooking games and this is so far best on a market . you can actually use these recipes in real world .
this game is so much fun . not only are you building a community of some of your favorite characters , but you also get to play along a story board and play small games in the game .
love this one . it 's not so easy . you can look and look before you finally see it . better than most .
too bad it kept me awake ! new i have to work : p fun . challenging . need more words words words words !
this app is really great i really prefer it over everything else ... but it does n't tell you what the words mean you just kind of have to guess ...

fun game . really enjoyed it . i wish it would of had more content . i unlocked everything pretty quickly . please add more
i love the app there are many amazing stories on this app but i do n't recommend it for anyone under 10
i like this magazine overall , but it 's okay on the kindle . i did n't buy a subscription though because i 'm not that big of a fan of the magazine in general .
this a good and interesting game with a lot of thinking and you feel that you have used your brain
i got it because all my friends have it and liked it but after a while i got bored and deleted it .
great and fun game recommend to get it its really epic game rate 5 stars if it 's not fun to you then you suck
my child played this and wanted a new one so we downloaded it on the kindle for her to play

this game is very simple to play and lots of fun . a lot of puzzles , have never had a repeat yet
i like this game . it keeps me in practice so i can beat my family when we play for real .
my 5 year old loves this game ! i 'm so glad i bought it . it became one of his favorites instantly .
so much fun ... ... ... . if you have money . seriously , this game tricks you into buying stuff so be careful unless you have 10 $
i have always enjoyed rpg games and this is a really good one to play on the kindle i would like more games like this in the future . keep up the good work thanks
perhaps i 'm old fashion but i prefer to read most of my news . 90 % of the news stories on this app are videos .
it does what it is supposed to do if you want to read horoscopes but other than that , its nothing special .
fun game , hate to quit playing but wish coins were n't so expensive . would be nice to play w/ friends even if not a facebook user .
i love this game . it is so addicting . a must have ! ! ! ! i downloaded this game today and i have not stopped playing it . works great on my kindle fire .
wife did n't like it - what else can i say . wife did n't like it - what else can i say .
super easy at first but then it gets into some real obscure movies i 've never even heard of . all in all a fun game
works great and fills the whole screen great app using it all the time and it is free which makes it great
just downloaded this game and am loving everything about it so far . i really like the bonus games when you level up . i 'd recommend playing this to anyone !
this game is an awesome game for people who like hidden object games like this . if you think you should get it , you should n't hesitate about it .
keeps requiring more coins . cute format but overall could n't play more than a few times before they wanted more money for coins to play the game .
this solitaire game has only one card released at a time which i like ! this is very relaxing and i enjoy playing it !
the graphics were very nice , extremely colorful and the story line was fun . the game was well worth the price .
good game . nice graphics . too many pop ups . now that i 've written a review , will you please leave me alone ? !
very addictive . a lot of fun . play it every chance and ca n't stop . going back to playing it now . bye .
this game is okay to play but gets boring after a while and its pretty much the same thing over and over again .
its the same as plants vs zombies . just it sucks . i would recommend that you do n't get this game . even free it sucks
i hate when people complain about their phone not being able to run this game . get a new phone or figure out how to make your phone faster . game rocks .
while it is kind of a cute little game it 's not all that spectacular or original . all i 'll say is i am glad it was free , because i would n't pay for it .
love the app . i have on my computer and glad they have it now for my iphone . it get alot of use .
this game is challenging and fun . its great when you 're really bored and have basically nothing to do . 3 stars
play a minute or quite awhile , it is amazing how the words come together in different ways . i had to have more !
loving this free app ! having to work at getting more games to open up is part of what makes this game fun .
some of it is challenging but all of it is fun , especially if you like thinking games like myself . i recommend this game to everyone especially parents that want their children to learn
i ca n't even get past the enter player name at the very beginning so i ca n't play at all . very disappointing waste of good money .
i loved my atari . this works just fine on my kindle fire . all it takes is a little hand and eye coordination .
good app makes you think ... fun seeing some products that you probably forgot about ... it 's a good game that even the young ones can play
this game is a lot of fun for everyone and you can see what i mean when you play this game too .
works good for what we need it for . a nice alternative for not having a you tube app and has some nice features you tube does not have .
the software is great with the way it works but the font is a little small and nearly impossible to read when it against a black background .
this game is okay . not that fun to play , and to unlock any thing more than the basic characters and colors , you have to pay money .
i love playing phase 10 so this is perfect for when i do n't have others to play with or if i 'm waiting somewhere to pass the time .
i did not care for this - i kept getting stuck , and the only way to move on was buy something .
this is a great app for exercising my brain . i probably prefer the flow game without the bridges , but this one is also very good .
as you can see i love to play bingo games . when i was younger i went to bingo games at my aunt 's at her church .
fantastic game if you need to pass the time . i got it for free from amazon 's free app of the day program , but it 's worth the $ 0.99 !
it 's fun for my little grandson on a car trip , but it is not educational . anything with trains grabs his attention .
i found this application helpful . it covers good basic chinese . my friend has noticed the improvement in my chinese skill .
with this app i have a lot of fun with my friends and its free so you have nothing to lose . get it .
great game , fun for all ages , extremely addicting . i would 've paid more for it . love it , love it , love it ! ! ! ! !
this game was ok at the start , but then things got harder . not enough hints . had to ask for help to play .
awesome game so glad that this game was made it is very smart and well made ! challenging and very fun !
i like playing solitaire and i like the variety that this app provides . i wo n't get bored and not use it much
great application . does everything i need it to be . i really like the short cut . i also like to see my credit rating monthly . i highly recommend this application for those that have discover accounts .
i have n't played yet but if its like doodle god its going to b fun so i hope you guys play
one of the better versions of freecell i 've played . i would definitely recommend this game to others . you can easily get lost in this game .
really do n't like as much cause i am too dumb to figure out all the angles necessary to finish a scene correctly .
this is a great game the really tests your reflexes . on the fire it is a bit touchy at times but over all it is a wonderful way to pass time in a boring meeting . : )
i 'm a huge minecraft fan and i love my kindle fire . but this app is n't nearly as good as the pc . its fun for awhile but gets boring .
amazing and fun . great to play and easy to win . great game . under world is very fun . i cant describe how good it is .
so far this is a very awesome game . it can be challenging at some parts and easy at others . i recommend it .
i 'm glad they finally got it for kindle . only problem i have is that the kindle 's version is behind on the latest updates .
well , well , well , this is just asking to get your device screen broken . not a wise decision my friend . nope .
brain gems is a lot of fun . it makes you think and learn new words . i highly recommend it . it 's good exercise for the mind .
get lost in space with angry birds space . very fun game , if you like angry birds , you 'll love angry birds space .
great game love it , very addicting . ca n't stop playing it . this is the hardest app to put down . thank you .
this is a fun and addicting game . i cant stop playing it ! i love it and recommend it to everyone .
exactly i expected , and kinda love it a lot and overall its a great way to waste time . try it !
i like it as you can talk quite a while and it translate it well .
i love slots and bingo games so yes this one is on my list . i just started playing this app so i 'm staying with 3 stars for now .
this game is just like the arcade game . i have found no problem with software . i get many hours of play time . it has been very entertaining .
skype comes in and sends my image as good as my computer . only used it a couple times so far .
flappy wings is addicting . i just ca n't stop playing it . i have been playing it all day and i ca n't beat my high as score ! !
this is the best app ever ! ! ! there is a website also . i would recommend this for everyone . and all ages
i can go back to this game over and over . it is interesting and holds my attention . i like the different story parts .
i have played this game once . my hubby like the variety of games that it offers . i am not sure how many coins are given daily .
glue games are so fun been playing this on my ipod for a while now great quality game for free .
i expected more from this game since i own zuma in my computer , but is not the same , i get bored easily
have played a lot of bingo games , and this one is one of my favorites . can not put it down . if you have n't tried this game your missing out ... ... ..
this is s great game for the brain in using relaxed fun game play . you will be hooked ! i have it on two tablets that i use . runs really good
this is an okay game you should try this game hope you will like playing it hope this helps you to get it or not have fun
its pretty fun . kinda difficult when i have no idea what the tv show is . its a fun game though .
sadly , this is a very boring game with almost no challenge . gameplay , graphics , and much of the dialogue are all weak . i do not recommend purchasing this game .
i love this game it makes me feel like i 'm at the beach and makes me feel relaxed even if i am just sitting there
temple run is finally in the app store . really fun game always is really fun . best game i ever played .
not easy to use , still working on it . it would be very nice if it was easier . still working on it .
i installed it , but wants a credit account before it 's use . that might be a nice thing to put in the app 's description .
i just could n't get into it . i got it just to try it , but i doubt i 'll play it much .
solitaire has always been one of my favorite classic games . i would like to see the other versions of it also offered on the kindle though .
just like the going to the fair ! goes a little slow if you do n't use iap but getting to higher levels on your own is still fun .
there was a great flow to this game , i could n't put it down and finished in a day . the hints and strategies areas helped a ton !
i like the game but the levels are very long . i like the puzzles and such . this app makes you work
i love the game it is so much fun for me and my family because it is so much fun to watch and to play it over and over again
the game is fun and simple . need big wins to make it even better . the level up and hourly coins is awesome .
having a blast but need more free bucks ! ! ! would like to play more with more free bucks more often that would help : )
great to have every one should should get this and try it good to have on your kindle it is a great item
good game but clues are too expensive for as slow as you earn game cash . a bit of a challenge when there are so many possibilities .
this is a fun app that covers all kinds of horoscope things . a fun little diversion on my kindle and for free it was great .
fun . i enjoy the out of the box thinking required ! the player is given plenty of time to work out the puzzle .
you ca n't even make your own city it 's built for you and you ca n't even make the city bigger this app is lame
pretty fun and addictive . do not need internet . i gave it 4 stars because i play a lot . very addictive .
maybe i am not good at it . i would really like to figure out how to make more complicated patterns
seriously loved this one . new twist to point and click adventures . really just a big old box of puzzles ... except so interesting !
i liked the game but it was too short for the price . looking forward to other games , and hopefully it will be worth the money spent .
one you half to be on the internet to play bad for me 2 it does n't really do much i know i did n't play it long was boring
have played all levels on easy with my kids , now going back as a challenge on a harder difficulty . nicely executed .
i am liking this one . i love hidden object games . the ghosts appear and disappear in this one . the objects are not too hard to find .
this game is awesome . i had this game for 12 years . my brother plays it and my sister plays it .
the text messages dont go through fast enough and when you get a reply its the next day and it dosent even make sense please please please fix this or why text on this program
if you like puzzles this is a good one . you have to really use your brain and memory . i found it enjoyable .
i really like the app , it can be read by yourself or with the audio , the person reading has a soothing voice . overall good app .
i have always like doing crossword puzzles and this is no exception . when i need a break from other types of entertainment , i usually go to this .
i love these kind of games ! it works great too . i think the clarity is great too . give it a try !
the game is alright but every time i win the game stops and i would have to do the race again .
fairly easy but is fun ! it 's very entertaining and would definitely recommend it to everyone . i say , nice job to the creators !
i thought that this was a good game for older two year olds . thought it was a little hard for new two 's .
i 'm finding this game to be more of a challenge than some of the games i 've played . i 'll be looking for more games by this creator .
my grandchildren downloaded this into my kindle when they were visiting . it is something i would never use and therefore have probably deleted it from my kindle .
great little game to play while watching tv or while riding in the car . it keeps you guessing as to the next move .
this stinks . it is n't real and does n't look real at all . get this if you wan na be stupid otherwise do n't get it .
it 's an ok game but i think it 's more geared for children than adults . it 's pretty good if you do n't want to do much thinking .
it 's easy to use and big numbers help a lot . and i got it for free . what else can i ask for ?
this game was pretty good i think that little girls will like it out is cool for other kids and adults too
enjoyable & oh yes it did n't cost me a penny . i was able to play & not worry about running out of cash like the other games
i like this one better than the candy swipe game , but its still not candy crush saga ! ! ! but its fun to play to pass the time .
when i had my computer i use to play all the time . now i have my kindle fire and now its on and popping !
i 'm going to enjoy following the reading of the bible text when i get into the daily habit . it 's a problem to just read but to be able to follow while being read to is exciting .
did not use is because after download did not realize i had to pay for items to play the game .
great way to keep in touch with friends and family . actually have family on facebook that i met thanks to facebook .
a good game . challenges your math skills , makes you think , and if you hate math like me or not good at it , this is a great game to help improve those skills .
found this difficult to use , and there are not current books that i 'm interested in . maybe down the road it will be better .
this game is very bad . you just talk to a guy who does n't understand a word your saying . plus who cant even see anything . do not get this app .
wonderful game very addictive . i love big fish games . you are the best in my opinion . keep up the great work .
lots of great information . can check all sorts of weather in my area . convenient and easy . shows day and night along with storm info .
i have n't used it yet but it seems to be a very helpful feature . once i get used to using it , im sure it will be better than paper !
i love this game ! i play it all the time ! ! ! i would reccomend this game to every one of all ages ! ! ! ! ! !
this is the same as on my smartphone . the app seems like its pretty good , have n't come across any problems yet . just wish i had the kindle with a camera lol !
i was new to kindle and i loaded several different types of games to play . this one did not keep my attention so i removed it from my kindle .
very boring app ! do n't waste your time getting this app because its not worth it . there has to be better apps out there than this !
this app did n't work on my four year old sons tablet i tried to reset it and it still would n't work so i uninstalled
i love this app ! it has so many games in this one app . the only thing i do n't like is the ads but an overall awesome app
my 6 yr. old granddaughter says she loves this one & # 34 ; because you can make matches and stuff and it is really fun ! & # 34 ; : )
love this game ! if you play it right , you can play for hours ! puts a new spin on hidden object games ... very addicting ! !
very fun and difficult at times . better than the first one by a whole lot and very epic and awesome .
you guys make it so old fashioned looking , not very exiting and its kinds hard some of the games so
the games in this package are pretty good . not too easy but not too hard either . interesting patterns and entertaining .
my kids loved this little game and learned how to play tic tac toe really good ! a must have for little ones learning how to play without all the paper .
this game is boring and way too hard not fun especially for younger kids because if you jump your horse practically always gets hurt
one of the funnest apps out there if you love music & amp ; playing with family & amp ; friends via facebook ! download this one you will not regret it .
i love pou it is a wonderful game and is super fun to watch it grow ! kids should get this app 100 % ! ! ! !
i do n't have an email a dress but i play it on my mom 's phone and i love it i think it should be 13 and older
this is a fun game . keeps the mind working . i know i am not that good at it , but it is enjoyable .
its a fun game so far but i cant figure out if can move buildings so had to uninstall to fix placement errors
i think this is a fun app . i wish i had more options on difficulty levels , but that is the only thing i would change .
this game is fun and helps pass time . i like how there are challenges to accomplish and scores to beat .
this is a fun game ! it worked for me and its kind of confusing but at the end it was true
the game itself is fun , but without a save feature the game is not worth anything . graphics are ok and the create your own story aspect is interesting .
g5 i am really happy with the games . the graphics are great and the puzzle are challenging i love a good challenge .
this is a great and basic bingo game for my kindle fire . i like that each day you are given a daily reward in case you 've ran out of coins .
i really like to play slot machine games this one is a lot of fun to play the best game i have played in a long time give it a try
very simple easy to play many categories and levels of difficulty . best of all it 's free with no glitches on my kindle fire .
i purchased this to download large library of information . it works very well and i am able to study and use the material .
i have this on my phone and i play on everyday . and have it on on the kindle fire but anyway this game is awsome bye yeah ! ! ! & lt ; 3
many of the key functions i wanted do not work on the kindle hdx 7 very disappointed not so much in the software but the kindle
this was a free app so i thought i would try it . i find it unresponsive at times , not easy to use and not very intuitive . i will be removing from my kindle .
this app is great for catching up on all my shows i just love . i recommend this app to everyone .
lots of screens & never boring ! can not compare with some of the other slot games - this one is very exciting !
like the app . for bored on a snow day at work with no business coming in so we all downloaded this app and ran around the store playing . we had a blast .
but i think u should try it is fun and free and if you dont like it just delete it . once again nice game . ; )
the pictures were nice but i had to just tap around my screen to find some items . some were very small and hard to find .
it was not very fun or entertaining . it also glitches up a lot so you have to restart it often
this game really brings the walking dead to life for you . i love the story line . i am so glad i have this game .
this is my 9 year old girls favorite app of all time . it is making her want to ride real horses !
great app , great developers from what i can tell . you 'll agree it 's worth getting . does what it says very well .
i got this to get a player for my tablet but i found another one that i liked so i went and deleted this one .
this is a great game with amazing every thing . very fun and great multiplayer . i would recommend it to every one .
not even close to quality of spider on my desktop . hard to select & move cards on screen . options minimal .
i got this app for my granddaughter and it is the cutest app . give this one a try . you will see as i have how even as an adult u will like it . very cute
great game and fun to play ! lots of people that i know play now . like to be able to chat too : )
this is the first game on my android that i actually try to find time to play . it 's fairly addicting .
i have another version that i like better than this one ! so i play this version only occasionally . it is free .
it is a great app , gives a lot of different sets of layouts , works as it should be . the 3d its very interesting but sometimes a little bit confusing .
i love this game ; it works really well on the kindle fire and its really addicting ! i recommend this game to everybody !
this game is ok but i would like one that the hints were better because i do n't know half of the logos .
i did n't use it much but it was just confusing . after i just got text plus . so go get a better talking game .
easy to get lost in . this game is definitely addicting . ca n't just play one round at a time . i would 're recommend if you need a time killer
i have all types of educational games , apps , books , etc for my now 3 year old and this still does not hold his interest .
so far no crash , works better than old one . fast browsing , very nicely set up . so far no problems . very happy .
this one was removed shortly after installation . do n't waste your time . the play is boring and sluggish . hated it . try another .
i love the background music -- very calming . the game itself i have n't quite figured out yet , but it 's worth looking into .
one of the most fun and realistic bowling games i have ever played . graphics are great and the pin action is superior to anything i have seen ! great game !
app is great and easy to use . makes life easier when you are using your device and need to be on time ! highly recommend it for daily use .
you get to take care of your own horse ! ca n't get any better ! best horse app ever made free ! i recommend this app to anyone
i enjoy playing this when i find some time on my hands . i must admit i am not real good at it , though .
so awesome ! i wish i could play this all day long because it is sooooooo awesome that 's y i wish i could play all day . get this app !
hello it was a very good game and was quite addictive also it had good graphics i really liked it
this game would be great but you constantly have to buy chips just to play . it says free but it 's not !
i am almost to the end . what 's next ? i guess i will try stack the states . it showed me how little i know about geography .
always watch abc at home so like being able to take it with me for my news fix . all the headlines and fun news too .
quite an entertaining little game . a good one if you do n't want to have to think a whole lot . . .and everyone needs a chance to just unwind for a bit !
i have only used this app a short while , but have found it easy to use and very helpful on my fire .
i love pinterest and this app works great on my kindle fire ! pinterest has something for everyone . i highly recommend this app .
hey i 'm looking at all the comments on this app ... .it looks great ! ! i hope it is ! ! lol i need more words for this comment !
i do n't usually like hidden object t games but this one is an exception . you are racing against the clock to find the items . i like the story line as well .
it does what it 's supposed to do . a simple calculator . there 's not much too say . if you need a calculator this is it
its a great time to play with . very fun and gets progressively challenging . plenty of stages that will keep you interested .
love it everyone should have it ! and it was free ! it is a awesome game and i was sooo addicted to it !
i love watching old movies and shows . this app has shows on it that other apps do not . i ca n't wait to watch more .
i do n't think i had the patience to get this fully installed . i 'll try it again in the future days .
wonderful game . my kids grandkids and i all love this one . it definately gets harder as you go along ! fantastic
yet another fun game . it really uses my memory and makes me think . i really enjoy playing . i really enjoy it .
game is fun but i 'm having problems logging into my facebook to share stuff and i 'm missing out on a lot of crystals
i like having this game it is easy to play i love it i have been playing it since i got it
it 's okay as word search games go . i had to take it off because it take up too much memory .
this is a simple but addictive game . it 's just like the block game i grew up with on my apple desktop computer . i love it and would recommend it to anyone .
ordered this app for my kindle . i have been using this for about 3 months . this app is a must have for any kindle .
my kiddos love it and never get bored ! since kindle fire does n't have a my little pony app , this is the alternative !
ok it is a bingo game , fine for something to do for those who like bingo it is a fine one .
it 's a simple concept , that grows more complicated as you progress . it is a mind game , not a skill game . enjoy .
better to watch him on tv than to sit and read his comments in written form . there much better that way .
lots of fun . the game is interesting . but i wish you could get to all the levels with out having to pay for each one .
this is an awesome game . it has cool graphics , you can play with your friends , it gets more challenging , and it has funny music in the game .
after . figuring . out . how well worth the price . keep making . them although could . have . a little . better . guide . to how to play
i like the app . what i do n't like is they copied super mario and put the same pipes . the app is fun
this is a nice game and its free i my boy says yes cool love it lol you can do it too its free .
i have n't played checkers in 40 years and it was fun to play again without having to look for an opponent .
if you looking for fun this is not good . even with my stylus pen the does n't always go where you want it .
this was another game that gave only one option to get points . i would have had to purchase points . to expensive for my taste for a game where you do n't win real money .
this app is awesome and is soooooo much fun and the new update where it gives you a free new gun every day
very fun game for the whole family . easy controls , no glitch at all . definitely a fun free game for all !
beautiful colors and interesting story . loved it where is the third ? this was not an easy game by any means , but very good .
it 's a great game . always have me thinking and have me on my toes . i will so recommend this game to people who like ago think .
my only words that i have to say are these : awesome ! one of the best calculators ever ! this is a truly amazing calculator
i like this solitaire game a lot . it 's fast and its a fun mindless pass the time by kind of game .
i have only gotten through a few levels so far . it is a fun game . worth the money to upgrade it . graphics are really good . fun for any age or skill level .
that game is very picky . i don & quot ; t understand . so i say don & quot ; t get the game it is the worst game ever . it should be a 0 star .
fairly good game ... it does try to get you to spend money on upgrades and such fairly often which gets annoying . overall , it is fun and a good way to pass the time : )
it says that it will talk in another language for you but it does n't it says the same thing just in english . very big waste of time and money .
i guess i just like pen and paper when it comes to a journal . there was n't anything wrong with the app , it just did n't suit me .
hi i just got this app i 'm at 2 ... .. its pretty good i guess . and its free so yea . any way i hope u enjoy so have fun .
this game is so much fun . i 'd like to play more games like it . it 's a little hard with out clues .
i downloaded it and it downloaded really slow ! then it is hard to jump and turn ! i do n't recommend it but that is just my opinion !
i like this game a lot . the graphics are great and so many objects to find , never a dull moment . the scenes are the best .
5 star game but really hard . great time waster . picked it up today and still super bad . still good fun .
awesome game . good graphics and interesting . themes . fun to play with kids and keeps you thinking . you never know where the next piece is and will that solve the puzzle ?
i downloaded this app and all it did was erase the progress on the original star girl , and sync with that . not happy .
i really am enjoying this game . my only comment is that i would like it if i could play without wi-fi . but other than that , very nice .
i ca n't seem to put it down . i love my new addiction . this game is fun to play and i find myself spending tons of time . give it a try !
after a few time , i found that i would close this game to look for my other game that is similar but a lot more fun to play
one of my favorite apps for my tablet . i 've tried many other casino type games , i do n't like the chat rooms . this app has amazing smooth graphics . highly recommended .
it was ok for something to pass time . it was free so i 'd get it again . need more words to submit
this is a fun word game if you like text twist or boggle you may like this game too ! lots of fun !
just can not get it to open or work . am going to remove from my inventory . if i ca n't play it do not want it taking up room on my kindle .
i like this kind of guessing / logic games . they are very good although the background can be confusing at times .
fun game but addicting ! love that i can change backgrounds and card faces . every once in a while i do have to delete from my kindle and reinstall . works fine other than that .
seems to be interesting , i only wish it gave you more to play on than having to buy something , i recommend it to everyone .
i was hoping to have more than one free cake to make . disappointing that pretty much everything costs money . i wo n't be wasting app space to keep this game .
my 2 year old loves it . the quick , short activities keep her focused and happy . another great monkey preschool game .
i really like this app because it is really funny . it is great for kids and teens and adults alike . i highly recommend this
sorry , it held my interest or about 5 minutes and then became very boring . i would n't purchase it ever again .
it 's ok. did not like how some objects were behind the ads , had to use a hint to find it .
the gameplay is smooth and although the levels get more and more challenging the game is somewhat fun and enjoyable .
i am always checking my account , so i got this app for my new kindle fire and it works great for constantly checking your account status .
to easy ... and when it comes to timed events , you can tap on object 3 or 4 times without the game scoring the find . no wonder this is free .
fun to check the day and compare it with what actually happens . pretty accurate . keep up the good work . thanks .
this is a fun addictive game a good game to pass the time . never boring , always fun . i really enjoy this game
i love this game . i love the fact that it is only 60 seconds a game and that you try to get as many bingos as you can in that one minute .
this is a pretty fun app . it 's really easy at first but the difficulty of the puzzles get higher . i like it .
this game and cartoon wars 1 and 2 are the best games in the amazon appstore ! ! ! i love this app !
the game does have some bugs and can occasionally have problems loading . other than that i really like this one . you can get through the whole game without spending more money on it unlike other games .
ok game , i 've done these before , but needs more free stuff before you have to pay . i 'm just cheap .
this was a typical find the objects game with a few other puzzle types on each level . not too hard but fun to play .
it did n't work as well as i had hoped and i 'm one for car games . i was highly disappointed and deleted it within the week .
really good app . i love the music that i am able to download . i would reccommend this app to everyone .
i enjoy playing farm games because they are never dull . there is always a new situation and different things to do .
from the graphics to music game is very well put together . it is similar to cut the rope game , but with its own this twist on game play and puzzles .
i could n't tell you about how this game plays , it would never load on the kindle so that 's my only problem
tried the free app and thought of buying him the full app . it was really worth it . try it because its a great learning tool for your kid
i could n't get it to work , so i deleted it . i have other and better word search puzzles . i do n't recommend it .
love the game and the concept , like that you can play holiday games or seasons , some are very hard some are fun and easy
when it looks way better in the pictures than it does in real life . i thought it would be kind of the same pictures but it was completely different
this is not a normal calender and still have not quite figured it out .
all the tools that the game gave you were useless . it seemed like there was no way out . not a good strategy game .
this game will not let me get off of the first game . i am suppose to be on level 4 but i ca n't get there . i am stuck on other than that the game is fun .
my husband got me into this game and i play it often . maybe too often . but its fun so far
i like that it is cloud notes . i have quick access to notes that i took , and the cloud helps
i 've only used this app a few times since i downloaded it , but it works fine on my tablet and i have no complaints . can definitely recommend it .
i love it because i can watch and keep up with my favorite tv shows and movies on my phone .
allows me to get wonderful photos straight from my kindle fire hdx . i have tried other camera applications and this is the best one yet .
this is a pretty cool and practical app . i definitely recommend it . this the reason that i do n't do reviews , i do not want to be told how many damn words i have to write !
very simple and easy to use . finally a way to organize your books on the kindle fire hd . keep up the good work .
my daughter spent about 40 dollars for gems in one day keep an eye on your children when using this app
a good stress reliever . makes you concentrate on something else . really nice pictures . like that you can make them as easy or difficult as you want .
rather confusing at first but you can catch on pretty fast . can be addicting too . sometimes you really have to watch a lot of things at the same time .
i liked this and so did most of my family . will you put more games on it though , because i 'm almost done .
this is fun fun fun i do n't like spelling a lot but it 's fun u can play against friends so fun try it free
an okay game . too hard to get some levels have to rely too much on friends to advance . other than that fun
this plays very same as the pc version which i have played for years . the only problem i have is occasionally with the touch screen on my kindle fire hd .
this is a very fun and enjoyable game . by rating it i 'm unlocking the other bird colors . but this game is truly great .
i love that i get a text on my kindle , android phone and ipod . no matter what i 'm using , i can respond immediately . thanks
i like it because it has big heads and you get to pick you level and you can put it on very hard
seriously does n't even let you play dominoes like you would normally so do n't download it you will just end up deleting it .
nice game the game is great simulation realistic guns nice effects just awesome just awesome just awesome just awesome just awesome just awesome
i was disappointed that there were so few levels . i expected more . i think that this game should have been described as one for children as it really was not very challenging .
it 's a cool neat game , just like any other escape type game . but it keeps your mind active . i like it .
i enjoy solving these puzzles . they work on my kindle with no problems . they could be longer though . i recommend trying them .
a nice game to have if you have lots of time to kill . nice options but i dont like the ads which pop up suddenly . they are quite annoying .
i enjoyed doing puzzles . after a few games , i looked up who wrote them because some of the clues were odd to me .
its really fun for when you 're bored . eh , you have to spend money like other games on some things but it is n't that bad .
the app is great to have and i use it often since i use the kindle fire before and after work . gives all the weather information i need .
it was good at first then after i bought it they removed the police from my city what a rip off
crashes after one goal every time . except the first time , got ta clear data to play , seems like pass n play works , but i hope they fix it . i will update my review once fixed
fun & amp ; not too challenging , a bit slow & amp ; unresponsive but overall acceptable play on my 1st gen kindle fire .
needed a app for driving directions gps not any help or was this app . deleted it still looking for a good free app
love this game . keeps me thinking . i think i 'm addicted . i enjoy the variety of pictures and ca n't seem to put it down .
this game made me waist 7 dollars i wanted to take this game to my school and do everything like that but this this is a bunch of bull crap
although we do n't get video games very often for our family , and when we do they are educational , this product is interesting and good to keep you going .
just started playing this game . it has been decent so far . would recommend if you are ok interested in this type of thing .
it is a really fun game . me and my husband like to see who can get a higher score , so it 's fun to play together .
great game ! app runs very smoothly with no issues at all . it has lots of options to customize how you want to play
good app ! easy to use and available when you need it . i was looking for something i could grab quickly and easy to find when needed , this works .
it 's great my 18 month old grand son loves it and i enjoy it also along with my other three grand kids . they do n't even need to know how to draw .
this game is so fun to me you should get it and play so much i will tell everybody about this game .
it is really funny i love it i mean not all of them are great but some most of them are really funny ! ! !
this game is fun . you win often and the bonuses are cool . my kids love playing it to ! thank you for a great game .
great game , pretty fun , its like minecraft , but your world does n't save so you cant make a house or anything , but there are cool places like hell and a sky world , so its ok
this is a very interesting and fun game . it keeps your interest . the only thing that i did n't like was when i got into the game , i had to buy the full version to continue .
i love this app ! the ads get annoying a lot . get this application ! best app ever . buy ! buy ! buy ! i love this app !
i enjoy the challenge of this game . just wish that for everything you do you did n't have to keep paying .
fast paced and fun . you have to be quick on this game or you get left behind . it is hard but fun i think it is very challenging .
i play this game almost every day . it helps to test my brain and stay alert . however , i do think the & # 34 ; game & # 34 ; wins too often . lol lol
this app is a lot of fun . you could sit for hours playing . it is a really fun app . you should get this app .
i did not really expect too much , but wow ! ! ! ! this is really a fun game ... .i recommend it if you like shooting stuff ! ! ! !
i love doing the angry bird games . after i get them all i go back and try for 3 stars .
the game is a lot of good fun but the graphics seem too small on my kindle .
i love it . i feel like i 'm actually on the show . the questions are n't that hard so you can have hours of fun .
great game . very challenging and when you think you have beat it there is another box to beat . awesome cant wait to download part 2 .
typical puzzle game with great controls . really i think the fact that you do n't have to put your finger over the puzzle is quite innovative .
it 's not the same game as on my computer , which i do enjoy playing and i actually play against old friends .
this is a fun game . easy to get going on . i would recommend this to anyone that likes doing games on their tablet or phone .
totally fun game . very addicting and challenging . i would buy it if i did n't already get it free . strategy game
could not get rid of the music so i deleted it off my kindle . did not play an entire game .
awesome game , just like my farkle at home with a few twists . would recommend anyone who has played farkle before to download this one .
kids love to play this game . i think it is a fun game too . good for working on problem solving skills .
i like card games and this is another good app for my kindle to use . i enjoy doing this a lot
no comment . if you ca n't say anything good about a program do n't say anything at all . i need four more words to finish this .
i have tried several weather apps and i found the weather channel to be far superior . almost all my family uses this app .
i really love this game .. it passes by time i just wish it had even more games for more fun
i 've just started the game . have been looking for a good game . hopefully this is it . it seem very interactive as far as these games go . nice graphics .
play on my kindle fire every opportunity i get ... great way to get my stress level down . i highly recommend this app to everyone
this app is totally addictive . i can play for hours . the monsters are too adorable . you never know what they are going to look like .
fast , colorful , and addicting . keeps you playing . i wish there were other ways to earn gold and lives besides paying more .
this is the most informative and accurate weather app out there . i trust and am extremely happy with the wonderful precise information .
they added more to this game than the other one . you have heroes and you can do more cool stuff
its alright not really i thought you could cut hair and stuff total waste of money people on the game get mad to fast
this is a cute fun little game , fun for all members of the family , young or old glad i got it !
have fun and try these games - do n't buy more than you can afford to lose as tokens can be expensive
earn extra tiles with a good review . i like this game because it really challenges you in the upper levels . definitely get your money 's worth in fun play .
this is a good app . i like taking care of my tom cat and dressing it up . good to pass time
but i am also a beach lover . however you should know it 's the same old scenes and sounds and it is very repetitive .
i really like this because it 's quite easy to customize to your liking . it 's accurate and it works and its free . and that 's great .
i had to try and think of all the phrases i knew . after you get one you want to keep going
additive , i love this game , it has taken forever for the crush to come out and now that it 's on my kindle i live for the next level .
i love this app and its just like any town building games it 's graphics are amazing and it 's has a great story to it
i love this game it makes u really think about what word u need 2 put down . the timer makes it fun . you should really get this game .
i ca n't put it down just have to make my town bigger larger the way i want it , about to go play it now since i talked about it ! ! !
another mahjong game . its fun , not different than the others just the pictures on the tiles . free app of the day .
this game is fast paced and fun . it is also beautiful and exciting . i recommend this game to everyone who like to be amazed .
i really enjoyed looking for the items . this is a challenge to locate the items . i really enjoyed playing this game .
i had a good time playing this game . it seemed to be a longer than normal hidden object game and i really liked that .
this is a fun game that has several levels of difficulties for each picture that you search . some are easier than others , but it is enjoyable for anyone who likes this type of game .
good game . keeps your brain alert . i have always enjoyed the challenge mahjong offers . have recommended this game to friends .
i actually am enjoying it more than the original farm mania - levels range from easy to challenging but not so hard as to be frustrating .
there should be a way to get the solution if you get stuck , otherwise it 's a waste of money if you ca n't move on .
one of the best games on my kindle . i play it everyday . i do wish they would add different words . or make it so we could buy others , like on the phone version ! !
this game is fun but there is so many old songs i never heard . i 'm interested in knowing all the songs no matter how old they are . : )
so many informative features and games all in one . had this on my nook and have added it to my new kindle fire .
love this game i have gotten bingo almost every time it is a great game can not wait to unlock other places
had great variety with puzzles . a good puzzle game that kept me playing at least . the room searches were my favorite
this app is horrible , not even worth it . i downloaded it and the game was boring . do not get this app .
seems to be a pretty good game . i have just started it but i 'm enjoying it very much . i love word puzzles !
i 've been playing this along with restaurant story and farm story : ) i just ca n't get enough ! maybe i 'll try another story later
good game though i got stuck on first one , lol . but so far so good . i would recommend it to pass time
great app for kindle but samsung phone hard to scroll up and down on the hourly part of the app . otherwise a good app
it would constantly stop working and nothing would be there for me to go back to so i finally gave up and erased it off my kindle .
same hbo right at your finger tips . especially if you have a fave show . i use it to watch true blood ! ! !
played through on the hardest settings the first time . less than 15 minute 's to complete entire game . if you are over the age of 12 , keep moving .
enjoyed playing all games . i but this on my kindle and it works great . i would recommend this package very much
would not install . i tried multiple times to get the app to install . it constantly kept giving me the same error . so since i could n't enjoy the game my rating is low .
it 's ok to have , but i discovered that i do n't really use it . so i really to have anything for or against it .
the ads in this game spin in and out of the center of the screen . it gave me a headache and i did n't finish the first game . i 'd rather pay than have this annoying game .
it was fine before the update now need yo delete and each time i want to play . kind of a pain
cute game .. free ... makes time go bye fast . lots of fun and easy to play . fun for kids and adults .
angry birds is so fun it cheats a little bit but other than that its great i love it : - )
very cool game . i came across it while playing paper toss . very challenging and just simply a blast to play . i love it !
this is another good learning tool that is fun for the kids . my grandson is 3 and i have quite a few games and puzzles on my kindle for him and he loves this one .
i use this app on a daily basis , and can see an improvement each time . i recommend using it to improve the performance on your kindle .
not as good on this game , i guess i do n't watch enough television , for those who do it would be a fun game .
my kids love the game to play that . they play it almost everyday now . it 's really fun to playing and funny .
just started using , and so far it 's okay . have n't taken the time to try all the features , so i ca n't comment .
it did n't work for me . i did n't focus enough on it . probably would have been more successful if i had started sooner .
what 's wrong with you this game is epic how long have you been playing this game ! ! if you had been playing longer you would say it 's epic to
this game is fun and challenges even the best . if you like cards and using your brain , then you will love this game . have fun playing !
i love this app ! i use it all the time . could be a little faster , though . i 'm glad its free . : )
this was my favorite story growing up some 20 years ago , now i can share it with my 2 year old daughter who loves books . there is no better feeling
i love this game . the best part is that they have regular movies and animated movies in different categories . very addictive .
i love word games . this one 's ok. not as interesting as i had hoped , and some of the associations are not all that accurate .
this game is fun to play and has some pretty cool scenes . i like that you have to look for clues and search for things and they do n't make it overly easy .
i enjoy this game very much . it helps me pass the time by . i recommend trying this game out . end
best game ever ! ! ! i mean it good that it teach you how to draw stuff but it take less step than i should .

i love this game . the free app is a great way to get to play it . the skill level is good for casual play .
i have always loved these games . very fun , like the challenges they give you . good game to play to pass the time .
if you get the app to make it better than the it will take a lot of time to download
quite challenging . i ca n't stop playing . i really enjoy this game . you should have more games like this one . it is also educational .
this game is awesome the first time i got this game i really liked it i think everyone should get it . : )
this game . good for little kids like 5 years old my little sister is addicted to this game . this game is kind of like flappy bird
really good and also addicting i play it alot and has alot of cool items too buy in the store
this game is great . alot of fun and not dull like other bingo games . just wish there were more free chips a day so i could play longer .
played the entire first season on console , and bought the season pass for kindle . there are no glitches , the game has amazing performance on kindle hdx , and the story is just plain awesome .
this app does what i have been using several other apps to do . i read about some others having issues with it , but is has been very solid for me
just starting ... .and so far i am enjoying this game immensely ... once i have played it for awhile longer , i will most definitely come back and do another review ...
i like this game a lot and my kids ( age 5 and 7 ) love it too . good game for long trips !
do n't like the idea of only having one picture to look at instead of all four pictures . yes , some r easy to guess with only one pic but prefer all four pics .
this takes me back - of course it is n't for today 's gamer but just interesting to see how far we have come
you should make it a free app again because its way to high for an app and what if something happens to ur kindle you will have to pay the price again . i have not bought it
it is a really bad copy of fruit ninjas . the one shot mode does n't work , it wo n't let you cut the same fruit in a row twice . do n't get this game .
i did n't think i would like it but it is totally addictive . i ca n't stop playing . love the game . highly recommended
i am using . first gen kindle fire and i am having no problems . i wish there were more levels in the free games .
these were really hard and to get help the cost of the coins were ok but you can not earn enough coins to pay for a hint unless you buy more coins .
downloaded for my granddaughter , but she 's not to interested in playing this one
it is too early to rate , but the 1st 15 levels are easy and i am having fun . i will continue to play and will write another review then .
my son and i enjoy playing the chess game on the kindle . the app has never locked up . i think it is fine for my use .
there are to many glitches and it gets really boring after awhile y is this such a popular game ? a a
can you guys make this a free app of the day please please please please please please . i know the game is great but it will be great help if it was the free app of the day
if you like hidden object games this game has a lot of them . the hidden object scenes are fun but the game is too short and the story line is too simple .
many whole family including my three year old love playing this game . it 's great watching my little one laughing at all the minions ! !
this is a good game for everyone . i would like it on game night with the family or just one on the kindle
if you play often questions repeat , but it is a good way to test your memory ! ? seem random , do n't seem to get harder as you advance
it is fun to play . i love trying to not use the help button . i 've played alot of these games and its cool cause you do n't have to buy the whole thing . love it
it sets a high bar for creativity and polish . clever and very well executed . we 're looking forward to the next update .
this game is addicting and i love it because you only have the tap the card that you want to move and the game sends it to the appropriate stack of cards .
was okay at the beginning but not what my daughter thought it was going to be . guess you have to like air hockey
this is just the kind of game i like . a puzzle game that keeps you guessing , but is not too impossible to figure out . i am enjoying it !
i like this game app , but would like it to be a little harder to do . maybe i just did n't continue on to higher level .
when will anyone need to do fractions , but if you do this is the way to go , but a paper and pencil works also .
fun game ! kind of difficult at times , so it 's got a bit of a challenge to it , but an exciting game . good for killing time !
i loved this game ! some parts are hard but most of the time it 's easy . great free game i recommend it for a party .
so far this game is pretty good . gets boring when you have all hidden objects to get a needed item . most mini games are good .
i love this app . i play it every morning on the bus on my way to school ! but i wish hints did n't cost so much
first time downloading any app . took awhile to figure out how to change c to f but worked out ok. easy to follow
fun game with no glitches . it can become addictive , but totally worth the addiction . can be played on the run , as the game saves each time you log out .
very fun game . when you first start it takes a minute to figure out what you 're supposed to do , but after you know what to do its a lot of fun ...
go with another app that wo n't crash as much and get in your way with ads all over the place .
very fun game . very challenging to . you really have to use your brain . just the game i was looking for .
i keep this on my tablet so when i have down time between meetings , i can : & # 34 ; recharge & # 34 ; my mind with this .
cooking dash is a really cool game because it takes time to learn it . it also is a very good skill game .
every time i sit down , i pick up my kindle and play this game . it keeps my brain working and active .
the app does what it says ... i ca n't complain . it 's easy to use . just click on the app you want deleted and hit delete ... done .
best game ever i played it for a week straight i started playing it and then i got all of my family and friends addicted to it to .
i tried six or eight different solitaire games before i found one that has everything i wanted . i love everything about this one ! ! !
it 's a good game very much enjoy the game . it also will work your brain . a must play game very very good game .
concept is cool . app of the day so i got it without really needing it . lives on the sd card so i 'm ok with that .
this numbers game would of been easier to play if the instructions told me how to play the game . it made no sense so i deleted it .
love it . it is really hard though since you pick from bad robots . i could barely even get past the first few rounds .
this is a pretty fun game . my kids and i like to play together . it is addictive and appropriate for everyone
i love this game , even without playing it i would love it because i have n't seen graphics this good on any game i have played . just looking at picture is excellent ! !
when i first started playing candy crush saga it took me by surprise . but as i played more and more i learned to love it so much . keep games like this coming

this is one of my favorite games to play . i 'm getting better all the time ! great time filler with fun , .
it took me a while to figure everything out but i did and this game is great . i recommend this game for hours of fun .
nothing special here . it does what it says , though . i do n't spend much time on facebook . i really bought it so i could test it for my wife . she likes facebook .

outside of the ads before just about every deal , it 's solitaire , plain and simple . great time to waste time . i recommend it
i love this game , i just wished you did n't need actual money to get more coins . most other slot games has more virtual money , but not as additive .
its a cute game fun to play interesting on how many ways to build machines to get job done . unfortunately i am stuck needing one more star , which means i can not go any further .
boring and repetitive the bonus is simple . on the positive it does play with you and allow you to gain points .
the only reason i got this is because everybody at my school calls me fat ! : ( i believe them . ever since someone said that i have been watching my weight : (
free does not mean free . this game constantly asks for $ $ $ there should be a way to block that function .
the game was fun but it could have been a little more challenging . i think young children would enjoy the game .
this is a great hangman game . very entertaining & amp ; quite enjoyable . i like the use of categories & amp ; it has aa hint feature if needed . great work , guys .
too many times i have to post to facebook or buy more points to complete a mission . interesting concept though .
ca n't find it anywhere so that i can play it . i 'm very disappointed in this . i would like to play it
waste of time , never got bonus , poor quality i do not have time to waste waiting for a bonus - too frustrating .
jump jump jump fun play it a lot u should definitely get it is a very fun game you will never get bored can get a little frustrating but you never get bored
worth every penny , totally . need a few more levels and fun to play but they should make the sides of view , free .
this is a really fun addicting game ! this is definitely one of my fav mahjong games ever ! i play it all the time !
i love this little widget for my kindle it helps me monitor my usage . i would recommend this to anyone , and as a bonus it 's free !
its working smoother than the old app . i can see and delete faster . makes checking email a more pleasant experience
this app has any game you might want , but i found myself going to the same 3 or 4 games . to much choice can be a bad thing . graphics and motion are great .
i like this puzzle although i think it is for young children , but it can also be difficult . i will ask my grandchildren to play it and watch their response .
nice alarm with a lot of good features ! perfect for work or school . would recommend to anyone looking for a simple but nice alarm clock !
these are great for learning to read . i love the cat in the hat and this app is so good for learning to read and enjoying books

this is a great game . good way to pass time when waiting . my 10 year old will love this . so far its not too hard .
it is a pretty decent game . helps me pass time at lunch . pay outs are ok. i am only on level 5 right now . let 's see what else i can play on here .
this game has a lot of choices on what to do , what to learn , and you can even make your own cards .
it 's got good graphics . i 've played games just like it before but never stuck with them like this one , i enjoy playing this game .
i love all of the libii apps . i have nearly all of the apps from this maker and they have always made me happy and made me laugh .

this is a great app ! i love having so many sound choices . i also like the fact that it will play continuously !
this game is a lot of fun ! ! it 's also a little challenging for you it 's a great way to keep your brain working at a set pace .
i got the game to see what it was like . i never thought i would play it more then any of my other games . this is a great game . i am totally addicted to it .
good graphics . the multiplayer is great . the maps are big and there are a number of them . gameloft are really good at these games . top notch .
this game is very good ! i really enjoy it ! the graphics are super cool . the game play is just too much fun .
just like the full site on my pc . i like the interface and this one will stay on my kindle .
it is not the type of game that i like to play . more for a child or younger person . but maybe someone else like it better

i was hoping for a relatively normal game of bingo but this is n't it . want a game like you would go out to play .
my 2 yr old son will play this game for hours if we let him . this game is definitely worth the buck you pay for it .
used this app for fun , but i never was able to beat it , so i lost interest in the game .
was mad at first that i ran out of moves and had to pay 3.99 for the game but the more i play the happier i am that i did i love love love this game & lt ; 3
i 'm a senior but this is easy game with just enough challenge for me to play . some of these games are more difficult for older hands .

i love this game i. am so happy its on kindle now great fun for all ages . a must for grand parents .
i love this game but it cost to much money to play and you got to the end of the game and had to pay more money to finish the game
it 's a good game . it 's quick and easy to use . you go through your lives very quickly though and have to wait for it to recharge .
oh my gosh this is just what i needed and it was free and that 's even better because this is perfect and i highly reccomend this if you are looking for a calculator
a lot harder than i thought but fun . makes me realize that i remember some things but not all things .
very nice to be able to sit and hear the current magazines that will be offered for the upcoming months . wish you would have the awake magazines in this way as well .
this one was downloaded by accident . i forgot to turn off the internet access button and my 2 year old added it . does not work for me .
i enjoyed this game . i 'm a really big fan of puzzles and this will certainly keep me busy for quite some time . i certainly recommend .
i downloaded it cause it was the free app of the day so what the heck . i would recomend this to a child between the ages of 1 and 3 .
i really like this game but i think it would be better if you could skip over the ones you do n't know and come back to them .
amazing . ive been waiting forever and now its finally here . absolutely perfect except sometimes minor glitches that cause death but still perfect
i like the game it 's challenging and fun . i like the backgrounds you can choose and it 's a quick game if you want it to be .
this ap is addictive and should be used with care . lots of fun for young and old . try it soon !
do n't listen to any of the negative reviews . this app is so fun . i have a blast playing it and i 'm sure you will too . it is worth the money .

i love that i can now play candy crush on my kindle fire ! i can play faster than on my pc ! ! !
works great on kindle fire . amazing app . can set alarm , sleep timer , great selection of music ! really great and does n't need any fixes .
have to pay to get hints , it 's ok confusing but ok. it makes you think and get confused . so i rated it .
this is a really fun shooter game , but it is glitchy , it shuts off on you randomly . if you fix this i will give it five stars ! !
its a pretty good game but you need you have to have lots of glu credits if u wan na buy any of the good stuff
i like dressing these girls up in pretty clothes because it makes me think about designing clothes . i like it very much
this app is okay . would prefer better art work and maybe better quotes . however it is very simply and easy to use which is nice .
i love it and would recommend it to any looking for a real jigsaw puzzle , it actually have the pieces to put together
this app is super adorable but the castle is a little bit pricey . i might buy it though simple because i like having all the food and clothes is want .
i enjoy this app . it helps my brain and challenges me . i use this app a few times a day . i also use a sudoku game book
my 12 year old & 9 year old finished the game the same day they got it . my 9 year old still likes playing on the different levels .
this game is awesome i never get tired of playing this game you will never get tired of playing this game
some of the puzzles are easy and then some are hard . but that 's what makes it challenging . love it a lot .
very fun wish it was more challenging but it was exciting loved the story line i wish the game had been a bit longer
i think this app is great if you have a love of movies and want to test your memory skills .
i too love this on my iphone . however . it looks a lot nicer on the kindle . a great fun casual game for everyone .
it works ok but i thought i would alert me with some sort of sound when i received a message . other than that it works great .
fairly easy to do . may take a little time to master it , but it 's a lot of fun and a great time waster .
lots of fun . no problems or glitches yet . would definitely recommend it to others got free so thats even better .
i love it and i cant wait until its like pc . i have broke my pc and i 'm stuck playing this : ( but its still awesome .
easy to do with a little thought . relaxes me just before i go to bed . sort of like a bed time story except in picture form .
i love this game . i can always beat the opponents . i play this every night before i go to bed . it is just like the real game .
i really like this app on my kindle fire . it gives me a trash fix when i need one . i like it better than the regular site .
great way to waste time and very addicting ... it 's colorful , fun , and fast ... best solitaire game i 've played so far ...
i got it free a couple months ago and i have to say this app is what 's helping me threw school enough said .
game pretty cool so far except i could use a hint right now and i have to either rate game or buy one . but besides that i like it
this game really fun keeps you busy to and can you do something like an update that lets us play offline ?
it 's more so like what ca n't this app do now ! ! easy to use , accessible and i personally enjoy the updated app .
the wheel to choose from is confusing . how to advance even after each station has 3 stars . need to understand the rules better .
this was a fun coin game . i liked it more than coin dozer . had more bonuses etc . try it you 'll like it .
it seems like it would be way too simple to be fun , but you find yourself getting addicted to it very quickly . the difficulty does increase as you play , and it is a really fun game .
i downloaded this game cuz i could n't play it on facebook for some reason . but i do enjoy this game .
i enjoyed the game it was challenging at times but a great find especially if you like to challenge your mind
i ca n't get past the first set of levels . i 'm wondering if its just me or if its the game , otherwise its good .
this app is so good . it is the easiest app i ever downloaded it is so awesome ... ..i word recommend it to anyone who i just starting to draw it helped me
great game . unfortunately , to play on it you have to spend money . i do n't like to have to spend my money to play a game .
this app is the best game ever ! i am so happy its finally on android ! ! u must get it ! ! ! it is fun and addicting .
i love this game . on the computer there is a game like this . please make more of this drawing games for free .
i deleted this app within minutes . i found it hard to play , have to spend $ $ , does n't make any sense . do n't want any more like this .
google has been my favorite search engine forever . very glad i can get it on my new kindle fire hd .
i love tetris but this one is a timed game and i do n't like them because i am not good at times games ... but some people might really love it
not much here , need more pages or subjects , got boring after a while , would not recommend , boring boring boring boring
easy to use and it has many options for bible selection , also great voice for listening to scriptures read with feeling ... .
nice app for kindle fire enough of a challenge without being to hard very large file for things with small memory though
the game is okay for a hidden object but it was so short you can play it all in one sitting .
this game is very good . it gives you many options for clothing , hair , makeup etc . i very much enjoy it .
this game is very fun . there are so many different fruits and there r 3 levels u can play so it never gets boring .
this game is really addictive . i am having a hard time putting it down . i have been playing it all day .
it 's old school and the boys beat it the first day i down loaded it , graphics are ok but now it 's over .
i 've been waiting to get this as the faotd and yesterday was that day . graphics and music are great ! one of the better apps . love it !
it never used to force close on me when the match was done loading . even in single player it will load and then force close on me , plz fix this
i hate this app . it crashes on me so many times . user interface is no where near ios . layout terrible . not suitable for high resolution screen like the kindle fire hd 8.9
its kinds creepy . i got it for my 5 year old and it is definetly not what i thought it was !
the game is pretty awesome . i definitely would give it a chance . odds are , you will be addicted after the first couple of levels .
i really like playing match 3 games they are a great way to pass the time when bored . fun and exciting to play .
i deleted it the second i got installed it . the controls are off and very much confusing to be at least . i would not recommend it at all ! !
it is one of the best games i have ever played , but their is an update and i ca n't play it
if you love the sims this is all you need . free and all sim like . just need internet to play though
if you have patience going back and forth between locations and searching out hidden objects , this is a good game to play .
this would be at the top of my list of favorite games if it were n't for the need to pay for additional stages . otherwise , it 's a great ap .
okay , everyone was right . this game is fun . i 've been a hold out but recently tried it . now i ca n't wait to have time to play it .
this game is my favorite game ever . works great on the kindle fire ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! if you love challenging games , get temple run .
nice game for a while but gets boring after playing a few times , too many of these running games . please use more imagination .
it took me a while to get the hang of the controls but once i did it was a lot of fun .
ca n't stop playing this game . ca n't sleep as i play till i win . very easy to play and i like the stats feature .
i really enjoyed looking at this game for the first 10 minutes or so , but after that time i got pretty bored with it .
if you want a break from candy crush try this . graphics are n't as good as cc but it 's still fun .
i ca n't even put into words how much i love this game . i 'm addicted to it . ca n't even express how much i love this game .
mine wo n't download . whenever it gets close it goes back to the beginning . and this may be just my internet but i do n't understand why it would be
i was happy to see this for the kindle . i played it on desk top computer for years . worth the money
i bought this app and did n't really like it its not worth the money ( to me ) . all you do is draw and its not worth it .
i 'm hoping it will help my two year old learn to read . either way its entertaining for her . love this book .
i think it 's fun . it does n't always play right . i like the bonus money . over all its a great game and i like graphics .
i like this game . you can play at anytime , interesting how it works . playing against other people that do n't know who you are is great , so if you make a mistake it 's ok .
the device has a camera and i did n't notice that there was already an app available . i 'll find a use for it .
fun game , gives you something to do when you are bored . fun to play against your friends on facebook , not a bad game for free
another great game that could use a lot of ui improvements . it 's fun to play but it really needs so design improvements
i love this game i love animals too thank . you please keep up the good work looking forward to more games
loving it so far i hate that you ca n't skip the hard ones but overall i love the game so far
this version of hangman did not meet my 8 year olds expectations . she was extremely disappointed . she likes to play with someone and this version was for solo play only .
a really fun game.i would definitely recommend this game.i even got my husband to play and he also liked . it .
love playing this game . rated it a five , the only thing i do n't like is the ads . very addictive . recommend it for everyone .
this game is so awesome ! i love all of it . i go on constantly to take care of my pou . my favorite part is all the clothes you can get .
if you like these type of games , bejeweled , jewel quest , then this will keep you interested . it is free ( at least it was for me ) and you cant beat free .
i like games that are a challenge . some are easy but some make you think . great game to play to pass the time .
you can also make it a little bit harder to find the object in the game and have it a lot more challenging and fun to play .
its pac man how could you not love it ! this is an old fun game to play and i never get tired of it
i love mahjong games , and this one is even better . it combines mahjong with comics and a kind of treasure hunt . i love it .
i have really enjoyed playing this game . my grandkids help keep my coins up and then i get to spend them
its like every other game . but its even worse because they want you to be on it every 3 minutes to collect money . that 's time i do n't have to be addicted to a game .
love this app . it works well . when i ca n't text from my phone i use this app and it goes right through .
if you know scrabble , you can play wwf . the challenge is building your opponent base . enjoy creating words and seeing what you can do with random letters .
really the only reason i picked one star is because i ca n't pick zero stars it wo n't install so that 's pretty stupid
it 's great except for the fact that it only has 8 levels and that u have to buy the rest
it is a pretty basic puzzle game . my niece played it at the family christmas , she is 7 and played till the battery was dead !
not a bad game , gives me an opportunity to practice before i play the game with friends . wish you could play with two instead of four .
i just got this and it wo n't let me install the app it deserves less than 1 star so do n't waste your money
i play a lot of bingo games and this one is especially addictive . keep up the good work with new and exciting upgrades .
i was disappointed with the fact that the new player did n't even get any chance to play a short time without paying .
it started our okay and then started asking the same questions . i never could go to different questions . if could went to more and different questions i would had enjoyed it .
love music , always enjoyed music trivia . now get to play a game with content i like and more trivia to learn .
once we start playing it is hard to stop . i love being able to flip over one picture at a time , it allows you to set your own difficulty .
just like any other game you would find on facebook . it is really boring . i wan na game were i do n't have to have friends that play it to move up a level !
its a great app and all , u know , the great grafics ... but it repeats the dinosaur , then i thought j could put the bones together . but u cant

i was looking for a game that makes your mind work . this game makes a person want to beat your own goals . this game will always be on my kindle .
dont play this one as much i like the other poker game i have better but it is a challange
tests your brain without being to hard . use it at least once a week . would be better with achievements and a timer
this is a great game to play when you do n't want to have to think ! loads of entertainment & amp ; it 's free ! ! ! ,
this is a good game better than others i have tried all should try just to say u did will become addictive game !
i love this game so much . its a lot of fun and you have to think about where you should put places and how many vehicles you need . it is addictive .
this game is so fun i almost always play it . i love it so much it rocks . i just love it
i do n't like it . thought it would be more of a cross word puzzle . it 's not . if you like guessing games , it 'll be fun . just not the game for me .
this is a good game because it challenges you to find a way to win . not boring at all and one of my favorites .
this is a game that my grandson totally loves to play . it never gets & # 34 ; old & # 34 ; to him . he is three years old .
this game is very fun . a puzzle that really gets your brain working . is challenging at some spots , but then when you finally get it , it 's just awesome .
my dragon is a fun game . and i 've recommend this games to my family and they loved it a lot ! !
actually a really neat and fun game . great for kids and adults . keeps kids entertained and easy to learn and operate .
it 's just as easy to open each email account as to open this app and in turn open each account . i really do n't need this app and have already uninstalled it .
you will get so mad how long it took to get this game . so glad because after like six months after made finally on amazon . log playing but levels can get frustrating .
fun game . easy and very addictive . i just want that great white already . not far to go . definitely recommend this game
doodle devil certainly lives up to its name ! and its not one of those ten minutes and ur done kind of games either . this is a truly fun , challenging app
its quick , informative and works just fine no issues that are negative regarding this app we like it very much
it is an ok app . not what i expected for this type of app . i will have to look around more .
i enjoy playing the game . its a lot of fun . great to pass time . i recommend it and i 'm sure if you like those old nintendo games , you 'll enjoy this one too .
this is an okay game . the riddles are medium . would be nice if you could link to facebook and ask for help .
all in the family have enjoyed . nice addition with the mission based challenges . only complaint is that we need more levels ! !
i love playing this game its fantastic , i would recommend it to everybody ! im a grandma and never thought i would like a game like this
they have alot of questions and answers and everytime they play the game , it just increases their knowledge . thank you .
this calculator is free , large , and does just what it is supposed to do . what more can i ask for ?
liked this game . i spent a lot of time trying to figure out the puzzles . only thing i did not like is the game is free but you have yo pay to get clues .
my niece and i really enjoyed this app ! and such a cute idea using candy too ! a lot of fun !
would n't work at all , would n't load after i downloaded it , deleted it , worthless
this is a fun an interesting game which , can be difficult . but when difficult its just more fun ! this game can keep any person busy for hours on end , there is no doubt about it .
i like a challenge . and this is a challenge . if you get bored this is what you should get . i just got it if you write a review you get free hints .
this is a good app for kindle fire hd . i did have a problem trying to figure out how to turn it off and still use other apps .
it is a great game that takes your mind off things ... .i think this game is so cool ... i have never played a game that is e ever this fun before
let me download it on my kindle fire and maybe i might give it at least a few more stars ! ! thanks .
this is great app to record and keep track of the books you 've read and to read reviews from others .
i like floppy bird it 's awesome game it 's hard so be careful when playing . overall a really fun game it 's flappy
this is a fun and memory challenging trivia game for those of us who grew up in the age of `` good tv shows '' . i 've played it quite often so far .
just started playing this game and i 'm already hooked . it 's right up my alley because i love word puzzles and games that challenge my brain .
it does n't work at all you get to a part of the game and it does n't work you ca n't play this game and do n't get it trust me on this one .
this was a fun game . my 9 year old daughter and i finished it in less than an hour , but she thoroughly enjoyed figuring out the mini puzzles . thinking of getting more for her .
i was n't going to try this game at first but i 'm glad i did ! i personally like it better than candy crush ... and i like candy crush a lot !
this app is so awesome . i can access my computer anywhere in the house without having to get up . it is also super easy to install . this is my favorite app ! ! !
this is a good time consuming game that works your brain . just need to play it for a bit to save coins and purchase the no ad option .
very customizable and functional . just what i was looking for to replace the default widget that came with the phone .
this game is missing any & quot ; fun factor & quot ; that makes you want to play more than 5 levels . no crashes for me , but could n't turn off sound effects .
this game is ok i mean its ok but after a while it gets boring so i recommend it to people who have patience
fun and addicting app . sometimes a person has to be careful in how the web is cut . fun for all ages as my grandchildren like as well as myself .
i browse through this app regularly to find great deals for holiday gifts . i find that it is easy to navigate , and generally well designed . 2 thumbs up : )
i hated it it was hard to place stuff and every thing you can build with was realy bad so i dont recommend getting it
this game is super fun and great . it can get a little boring waiting for things to finish , but its still really fun and i recommend this game for everyone .
this is a decent program . i used it a bit but i had got it for my teen son to help him .
great app . my son loves touching the items on the pages to hear and see the names . this story teaches a great lesson .
i love this game ever since i was little . this game is easy but there will be a few challenges , but you will get the hang of it .
i have become an addict for dress up games . this game is great for anyone that loves fashion and makeup !
it seemed to me that it did not work well so i deleted it i like to do puzzles occasionally but not this one
i loved this app during the halloween season but i wish new scary stories were added every day to make this app interesting .
it 's a really good game surprisingly i started it up and played a game and was instantly hooked it is a nice casual game that you can play for 10 minutes or a couple of hours .
quick game for those times when you only have only a few minutes or when your not sure how much time you have to play .
the program is good it is just i really do not have need of it that much . the information is accurate and timely .
found this to be too difficult . maybe a stylus would have helped but we never made it past level 1
i like his app because it can be used on the run . i can find places and get directions easily .
it 's just what you 're looking should you want to play a game that 's not stressful but highly challenging ! the music 's pretty nice also .
looking forward to playing this game . i have in the past and it is one of my favorites . thank you .
it was fun playing this game and trying to find all the hidden objects . some objects were easier to find than others . it kept your mind going .
great brain game ! i did have to cheat a little ... ..i get frustrated easy , but only on level 9 and 10. ca n't wait for more levels ! ! !
i can not even get thru 1 level without a force close . sucks . seems like a nice set up though
it does not work anymore it never loads on my kindle fire hd this makes me so mad , i mean it used to but not anymore
i got this for my toddler and she thinks its great . for me not so much , but perfect for her .
when is the new version coming out cuz there is this one world that says coming soon idk when that is do u guys know ?
really hard but u want to stay on for hours i love it my mom loves it and sometimes i do i love it and my family does to
keeps me entertained . grand kids like it . it 's an awesome game . you get to spend quality time with someone .
fun game once you get the hang of it . the only draw back is you have to purchase some things to advance in the game . other than that , it 's a fun game to play .
only have this game 4 stars because of the ads . other than that , this game is a lot of fun and will really pass time quickly .
best driving game in the world ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i had been looking for a cool and challenging driving game and i finally found one .
the game is fun and it is entertaining but it takes to long to get back around to your turn . i lost interest
this game would be in my top ten for all kindle games ! i recommend this game for a lot of people so download and enjoy ! ! : )
pretty good little game . it 's fun just to see how good u can do . do n't let the coins fall off the sides though .
this is a nice and easy app with a useful user interface ; a nice addition to my kindle fire and best of all , it 's free .
this seems to be a pretty good game . so far it is fun and relaxing . graphics are real good and i think it is a game everyone should at least give a chance . happy gaming all .
does n't make you wait for long periods for things to grow , build , etc ! very good plus to not have to keep waiting !
rating because love the movie more than the game because do n't like in-app purchasing the game was hard but interesting for anyone who likes those games
the game is very fun and addictive . hard to quit after you start . works very well on my kindle fire .
i think it is very entertaining . my nephew likes it alot . i am 11 years old . i like it because , u just draw a line , and u have a pretty picture .
its alot of fun and i can play it on my phone , and kindle fire . it is really alot of fun and you can challenge yourself and others .
only played it once and it was good but kind of boring ... . but what do you expect with hangman ... . very true ! ! ! !
i got it for free and i loved it until it crashed so i uninstalled and then tried to re install it but it said that i still had it and i 'm still trying to re install
talk about an addicting game ! i ca n't wait for future levels to be added ! i would recommend this game to every one !
i 'm very surprised how my daughter plays soooo well with this app ! i think it makes little ones realize how important is to take care of a baby .
who does n't like robots that beat each other up . l like the app but i wish it would include the main characters
when you run out of spins , you are asked to buy . it 's free to download , but not free to play .
i really do love netflix and being able to get the information on my fire is wonderful . then , getting to watch a movie there is fun .
this is a better game for the grandkids ... they love it and wanted me to learn too ... i got through all the levels too quickly .
this was a fun game . full of adventure and strategy . the story line was interesting and there was so much to do that kept me hooked .
love it when i have been in the past two years ago by the younger brother is the younger than one year
no matter which tab i click on all i get is the us news . dont know hot to delete it so i can try to download it again .
it 's a fun game . i like it because it 's fun and entertaining . i would recommend it to adults and children .
it is a very pretty game but gets boring fairly fast . it does n't make me want to purchase the game . i have enjoyed it but probably will delete .
i really like the app its quite fun the thing i do n't like about it is that it keeps on freezing after every single game other than that the app is good ! !
i must be old , no instructions to figure out how to play , i tried several times , so i deleted it from my kindle
my kid loves this game . she plays it all the time and has my wife hooked on it too . it tells you when to collect your coins and gives you cute animals
love the game in solo mode . online play is a little tedious and slow , but glad it 's an option . have n't tried pass and play yet , but i 'm sure it 's fine .
not a huge cat fan . this game is ok but even though it gets harder finding cats just got boring for me
this is a awesome game that is a really fun game that is kid safe and fun for all ages
i like this game but there seem to be a lot of adds . when a game is free i expect some adds but these seem to last longer then others .
it is like no other game i have ever played in my life it is just like the the game
i like this game a lot i just wish i can change the characters . do not want to play with the character all the time .
this game loads too slowly for me . it is just ok for when i 'm trying to find something to do .
this game is not much fun if you are playing by yourself . you really have more fun if you can play with 2 or 3 others i have found .
my girls love playing this game ! they love to decorate the bunny , and the egg ! ! ! this is a cute game for young kids , easy to use and they enjoy it !
runs great on kindle fire . i 've played several games of this type & amp ; this one is by far the best . i do n't get bored like others . two thumbs up .
i love this game u need to get it it 's fun and a good learning game get it now please
i think this app is more for smart phones . at first i liked the variety of bird calls but it was constantly closing . oh well , it was fun while it lasted ...
it 's nice to have this on my kindle . it does everything i would expect it to compared to the regular version .
i download this app and my little girl loved it ... its a fast learning process and i would recommend this to my friends ...
enjoy playing this game and look forward to getting better at it . takes some concentration and i definitely find it challenging .
i thoroughly enjoyed playing this game . the story line is good , graphics are great and overall the game is very addictive . highly recommended
my grandson ordered this for himself and he loves it . is n't it amazing how a six year old knows how to download games and apps but my husband can not work his tv remote ? !
i deleted it the next day . worthless . not user friendly , would not let me exit after making notes . nor would it let me make changes .
its an ok game , if you have time to play it . but can also only go so far before it costs money as with any game
i bought this twice i love it so much . very challenging . the game sucks you right in . you should . try it out
good game like that you have to reach different goals waiting for more great games in future keep up the good work
great app ! i have used many others and i like this one best ! i find that most places that i am looking for can be found , and that was n't the case in other apps !
my husband and i got this game . it is really cute . i like that you can hatch and grow dragons .
looking forward to getting more hands on with it , it seems to have everything you could want , cant be bad .
simple to play and fast paced . love , puzzle games so this was a must for me ! its also great that it syncs with facebook if you play the game there .
this app has a great variety of sounds so i can mix & amp ; match depending on the mood i 'm in ... or want to be in !
i love this app ! it 's easy to use and very detailed . works everytime too , does n't freeze up like some apps do .
unlike the pc edition of this , this android one is not quite as easy to navigate . you do seem to have more in the way of free books to go with this edition .
you will want to spend money but as long as you keep at it you really dont have to . fun and addictive .
can not play more than one card at a time because playing another card is to small to read . eye problems .
it 's ok. alot like the other versions but you have to have a creative mind to build the vehicles to get to the end .
i ca n't stop playing this game . i go back and redo some level to get a perfect score if i did not get it on the first time .
there are much better physics type games out there , for example any one of the angry birds series . played it a couple of times and got bored fast .
tetris blitz is a fun game , but harder to play . it 's fast and i just have n't caught on how all the plays work .
this app is great . has all the answers for this particular logo game . graphics are full color and easy to read . makes a good review for other logo games , also . it is a keeper !
i really like it its a lot like the show . i recommend it if you 're a fan of the show .
this game was ok. it said you could have multiple players , but i never saw that option and believe me , i searched all icons . just glad i did n't have to pay for it .
i like this app . it definitely comes in handy . i do n't have to carry my bible so i am not having the extra item to carry . i can use it during break time with ease .
i like this games because u can learn how to design your own shoes and make the special for someone .
i play this on facebook and i am so glad it is available on my kindle . now i can play it on the go .
when you ask for round trip rates - it gives you one way , you think that it is a good deal but then when you try to book it . the price is crazy high
it is a fun and very cool game to play with and it challenges your mind with the fun puzzles .
i was hoping to see more variety of shows and movies in this program . the app is cool but they need to improve their collection .
this app is bad if ur a kid . if a adult that wants to run a bar get this app now .
hard to put down . good educational tool . even younger people would enjoy this game . you really must try it today !
this app crashed as soon as i clicked it to open it . i deleted it right away so it would not effect anything else
all i know is the add would n't get out of my way when i wanted to play the game the sims
i removed from my phone , too much like other games i have and i dont have time for them all
i do n't even remember what this was that 's how much i thought of it . blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah
there is not really much more that you can say about the app , it runs fine it installed just great . nothing more to say
you have to try this game it is so cool so you download this app it is a fun a great game
a single picture comes up and you guess what tv show it is from . i have only played a few so far but it is enjoyable .
you know those games that are so boring but so addictive ? ya well this game is one of those so ya get it but be aware its boring but additive
this game is extremely addicting . only play it if you have a lot of time and patience . not meant to fill a short wait .
it makes you care for these little smurfs and build them a town with a garden . you can play without spending real money . game is fun for kids .
this is the best game ! it is better than temple run ! i really recommend this app to temple run lovers cause its the same concept but much more fun .
this game is challenging and yet fun i find it to be quite addictive : ) sometimes i really have to think about what the word is
i played the game so i could watch the music video . the video is sick in a cute way . way to go !
i 've had this app forward while now . i was n't impressed , and so i let my friends and others play it . i still would n't have paid for it .
there are some really fun pictures that bring back the 90s , but there are more that without google i would have never gotten . even after finding them on google i still do n't remember them .
so realistic . it even shows mistakes and lets you clean them up . now they want to copy the designs on their own nails
i love this game and find it hard to put down ! just wish we could earn more time on or have the ability to set the time limit you have to play a puzzle .
a great game to test your movie knowledge , however , maybe not so wonderful for those of you who are n't movie fans .
awesome . other people are having it reset the game but it is perfect on my kindle fire hd 7. no glitches . no crashing . just fun and awesome and silly and awesome and epic . yay .
this game is amazing ! why is it so addicting ? i have no idea , and it 's not as easy as it looks either . great colors and graphics .
i am playing candy crush on my iphone and on my computer but this version on the kindle does n't sync with them like words does and i do n't want to start an entire new game .
i got this app thinking it would be levels and its not . its just a bunch of mini game that repeat and repeat and i got sick of it .
it works when it wants to , i hate how it will constantly close and i 've upgraded it twice still same thing so i just gave up on it at the end .
similar game play to angry birds but way less repetitive . you do n't just launch and hope , you usually get several throws power cat and helpful power ups and the graphics and sound are good .
i tried to play this game and it took too long to download and come up . it just was n't worth the wait !
fun some pics are easy others pretty hard . all in all a pretty fun game . i recommend it to pass the time .
have had a great time playing this game . i enjoy the images and have been a winner since the start .
very interesting relaxing game . do n't like to buy items so it 's all my own skill . will probably delete in a few days .
just the most go to place for anything your hunting for or wanting to know about , starts up quick on my kindle
love to see the prizes coming . ca n't wait to get a puzzle completed . this game is a no brainer . try it and you too will be addicted .
this is a fun app , and it passes the time quickly . the 4 pics 1 word app is really fun and easy to use .
so awesome ! get this app you ` 'll love it if you are looking for a great game get this ! get it
this game is beautiful , i love all mahjong games including this one , what else can i say except that i have about twenty different mahjong games love them all .
when i saw this game i thought it would be lame so i tried it and now that i tried it i have almost all of the other story games point is you should try it !
entertaining , challenging , and scary ! hard to put down once you start ! cant wait to try more big fish games ! 20 !
my son loves this game . it 's cute how you can save their dishes . this game will definitely keep the kids busy .
this app is poop and is not attractive poop is still no attractive so do n't waste your time poop poop poop poop
it is a very very very very very fun and cool game to play and to share with friends to play
it is a very entertaining game where you meet a lot of new and interesting people who help you in the game .
it 's angry birds but you get to use your kindle as a steering wheel . it 's more fun to an old character like me than the other angry bird games currently being played .
extremely addictive ! does n't do two letter words but a great game on my kindle fire . i have stayed up way past my bedtime because of this game
i can sit and play this game for hours on end . i have it ; loaded on all my devices . thank you
this is a great game to just kick back and relax . what 's really awesome is that it was free ! thank you !
thought it would have more video . its like reading headlines of a newspaper . do n't really get too much from it .
this game is awesome it should be bought by all people it has no problems on my kindle fire and my little brother loves this game
i 'm not sure i understand the game yet ( and my husband says it is & quot ; cheating & quot ; to play tetris like this ) , but it is fun and addictive .
my first scan took some time but after that i never knew anything was going on until i checked it . does n't drag my kindle down and much to learn once i really get into it
this bingo game is the best i 've played so far . you get coins every hour and i 've had no issues with it freezing up my kindle like i have had with other bingo games .
you have to pay to get any sounds and the only reason i 'm posting this review is to get more sounds
i love this game so much it is so addicting i can not stop playing it i can play this game 24 7
i 've been waiting for this app for some time , and now that 's it 's here and free . it was so worth the wait . a game for all ages .
this is an amazing game because i am always doing word search puzzles and i really enjoy beating my own times ! ! !
like game . glad to see more games on kindle fire hd . like all their other games . keep up the great work
love this game so fun to play i play with my hubby all the time he and i compete when we play its so funny
i played this game and the first time it was challenging . then the second time it was less so . now i do n't play it at all .
game works well and is fun to play , grandkids like it , story format is good , and graphics are good too
it works great , it keeps my device safe and it 's so easy to run . i down loaded for my phone and kindle as well !
i love this game so much ! i love the fact that its like real life graphics are pretty good too
love these brain teaser games and especially when they are free . i really wish there were more levels so you can play longer .
i do n't like it i am trying to download it and it does not work i was getting so excited to watch my favorite disney channel shows but now i can not ! ! ! ! ) :
love this app its amazing and i cant put it down ! all my free time i play this awesome game ! must download
very easy to use and really helps you learn the game . i recommend it . really a great program to help with chess .
i have no idea how to play this game or what the idea of it is . will not be playing .
i love this app but i wish the stuff cost less , but i love it . oh yeah i love the realistic features this app has .
easy to play on my kindle fire . if you like the board game you 'll enjoy this app . i could n't find any instructions but it was easy to figure out .
this game is so cool for girls that are into fashion like me ! i did so many levels the rest is coming soon ! # love this game
the game is flat out boring . but i can appreciate the work that went into it.i 'm sure some one will like it though
this is a fun game , relaxing finding the missing items . it would be nice to have a walkthrough for a few of the islands , but you can figure out most of them easily .
love these games ! keeps me guessing for days sometimes . i flip between a few different apps for this type of game .
very challenging i do n't watch much television so far this has been very challenging . i have been getting help from family and friends .
this game is so cool i mean come on who wont like this game i love love this game it is fun fun fun !
love the pics and the ability to choose difficulty levels . beautiful horses . would definitely recommend this game to my friends .
found game rather repetitious . same old thing over and over and over . office jerk is way more fun than this game .
fun quick play that reminds me of all the cartoons i used to love growing up . like the movie and tv show games
i think this app is alot of fun to use and play . i like the graphics and the different levels .
if you like to play solitaire , this game is for you . user friendly , and a great way to relax after a long day at work .
i love this game so much is very exciting to play and teens my age would adore this game ! their is facebook connection on this game also
very enjoyable just like being in las vegas only you do n't get to keep the money you win . hours of fun right at your finger tips .
it 's great to have this challenging ( frustrating ! ) game on my kindle . i 've enjoyed it on my computer for quite a while so being able to take it with me is a treat .
really fun game and a quick way to pass some time . only bad thing is you have to pay for extra coins .
this is a good game but there are many more games out there a lot like this one . i think this game needs its own little twist .
cute game but it has issues . stops working ; wo n't . open etc . too many animals require mini bucks which u have too purchase .
lets me do what i need to do , and has a fair amount of functionality available when using on a normal pc .
free and gives a look of htc sense plus lots of other options . you can pay for more options as well as download lots of free skins for the clock and weather and such
fun app . if u like old school mario you will really like this ! not one problem on my kindle fire .
this app is wonderful for my kindle fire . the ease with which i can post to my pinterest page is great . i just have to share to the pinterest app and away it goes to my boards .
ok. still like original birds the best . just ca n't get into this one . not a big star wars fan anyways . even seasons was more fun .
would n't work correctly on my kindle . graphics was not very good . slow at loading . it would probably be a good game if it did n't have the glitches .
this app . is okay , not what i was thinking ... . i guess i need to read the information better next time .
i can not see where it does much . i do not see it run . i have to go in and run it , it needs to run itself so i do n't have to .
pretty good game for the money . graphics could be better . i feel like i got a good game for the price . hope there is a part 2 ! !
having fun learning this game , i have it on my iphone and really like it , alittle different on this apt . but will enjoy learning all the game can do
really enjoyed this brain teaser . lots of fun for the whole family . i would recommend this if you like a game with a twist .
i have a low end android 2 device and this is the first game we found that always works . easy to pick up and good for killing time .
this is the best game every when i had first started this it got me amazed . this is the best game every
i rated this as & # 34 ; it 's okay & # 34 ; because some games are just not like the real thing on a kindle . it 's fun but not awesome .
the are you smarter than a 5th grader was a very fun app that i enjoyed playing , i would recommend this game to everyone .
very very very nice game . i like this game . its fun . it is a good game for girls . get this game
i play solitaire quite a bit and this is very easy to use . i would definitely recommend it to my friends
this game is challenging , but so much fun . i could play this all day . i especially like to play the same people in multiple games . this is a classic game for all
i am glad i downloaded this news channel like to watch both news stations to keep up to date and it 's easier to watch on my kindle fire .
good game good graphics works great on my fire : ) great value for the price lots of puzzles and hidden object play
this game is terribly awesome . it 's very addictive . i play on my kindle hd and i love it ! great quests , cute animals , and sweet bosses . could n't get better !
i have n't received my order to the price is right slots so i do not know how to rate it , please help me
love this app . i like how you can touch the screen and make fireworks appear . i would definitely recommend to a friend . : )
what a great alarm clock app ! ! ! i love being able to customize the different alarms i use everyday . it 's never let me down .
i think i may quit getting free game apps . i have yet to be happy with them , with the exception of angry birds .
i did not like this version of boggle . i downloaded word 4 word which i like very much better . thanks .
i had fun with this but had some trouble sometimes figuring out what i was supposed to do in tight spots . a few more instructions would have been nice . but i would buy more from this company .
this is my favorite weather app . it has so much info and is so easy to use . it 's a quick way to check the weather . just love it .
i thought it could do more . i have n't used this app that much . the kindle software upgrade does about the same as this app
i like how smooth this game is to play . relaxed mode challenges in a , well , relaxing way . great game for quick play or for longer periods if you have the time .
it 's ok , but so far , it 's not what i thought it would be . maybe it will get better , i do n't know .
plan on taking it off my kindle fire . not a game i will play ... not a lot to it or something
great game ca n't beat it best blackjack game ive ever played . play it all the time great time waster you should buy
fun word game . not sure yet if it gets more challenging . would definitely recommend . can be played by young and old . wish you could choose different levels .
i chose a rating of 5 stars because this is a very good game . the response is very good . it is a pleasure to play .
cute game to spend your time playing while waiting in the dr 's office . keeps you busy and the time goes by fast : ) plus it made laugh : )
this game is awesome ! but i wish it was easier to gain life style points it 's so hard i do n't know who to earn them : /
im 13 and its so fun to me to play with when im so bored and there is nothing else to do
this is an awesome app . its perfect for when you are bored and just need something to do it gives you a selection of challenges . !
not so good . as a matter of fact , i deleted it the same day !
i do n't think this game was very challenging . i am glad they let me play it for a while before i had to pay , because i deleted it when it came to that part .
this is the best game in the world its even better than angry birds ! its exactly like mario except way better !
i wish it had more coins other than that i love it great game best coin pushing game yet ... . luv it
i find it hard to quit playing this game . it is very close to the pc version - maybe better since i do n't have to use the mouse .
if you have kids or grand kids that like fish this is the puzzle for them . mine really like it
i was playing this today , and i could n't stop playing because it was so addicting ! you should rely get this app it 's fun , cool , and free .
love this game . have so much fun playing . only problem is that you go through credits way to fast other than that a great game .
i love the interface ! the graphics are incredible ! my daughter loves this game and there are multiple levels so she does n't get bored ! i definitely recommend this game for the educational value ! great game !
this is a fun and addicting game . when it first came out i thought it was pretty cool . its still fun ! you should try it out and then if you like it , buy the full version
kind of hard . but once you go through it you catch on and it makes sense . spooky and cheesy but good hope there is a sequel .
i really like this game . its a lot of fun but so far pretty easy , least for me . still really fun though lol
love it and my kids actually get into it as well i would recommend this to anyone that likes a good challenge
there is really nothing wrong with this game , it just was n't what i expected it to be ... more of a child 's game .
love this game . it is awesome because it has better graphics than flappy bird . absolutely love this game ! ! # amazing
this game is so fun ! you can complete achievements and battle . my favorite part of this game is seeing the creative kinds of dragons put into this game . i recommend this game to everyone !
this version is up to date but the format is what makes it a great app . you can quickly find the book and chapter you need which is handy in a class situation .
good way to find deals but not very often do i pick one up . window shopping deals and seeing what 's out there .
this game is awesome ! its so fun ! fast paced and exciting . cute graphics , great sound effects , and just plain fun to play . thanks amazon for giving it to us for free !
this game is really fun ! ! its like mario for you kindle ! must have app for your kindle because it is awesome
i like this game but the things take to long but its fun and addicting so why the bad reviews .
allows me to listen to music when i read on my kindle or just as some music when i am in a spot where i ca n't get access to my radio .
i have tried other pinterest apps but none have been a accurate and efficient as this one . i would recommend this app for anyone
i gave it three stars because i am used to nine numbers instead of six . it was easy and colorful to play .
i hate having to buy coins to play a game on my kindle . i have uninstalled it and will not buy this type of app again .
this is a fun game to play while killing a bit of time . the games are not too challenging but just challenging enough to keep interesting .
luckily this was a free app , because i finished it really quickly . this was n't much of a challenge at all .
not bad game play all though the controls are a little sticky . it is a little difficult trying to aim and move but can be fun .
i wanted a full piano to play and this was not it . it reminded me more of a kids piano .
i have played this game for ever ... ..it 's fun fun fun ... ... play it it 's hard but you learn to get along i love happy happy ...
the game was fun until i could n't figure out a response . then i could n't move forward . that was very disappointing .
escape games are usually too hard for me . this is a collection of short , easier versions of the genre . you only have to beat one room at a time . pretty satisfying .
this game could be so much fun , but it 's absolutely terrible . i just downloaded the new update hoping for better controls but no . this game is n't even playable on the kindle !
i loved playing this as a child . now my children play this very addictive game and they love it . i recommend this game for the whole family .
i think that this is a cute fun little game . so what it is repetitive but killing zombies is fun ! ! ! my 6 year old plays it as much as i do !
great app ! i love that i do n't have to be online to use it . i compared points to the books to make sure it was accurate and it is .
so awesome ! certainly worth the free ! i definitely recommend this application to anyone looking for an exciting game . great job .
was like all other hidden games out there really no bonus and not very interesting and s slow to respond
i am completely addicted to this game . watching tv is not the same without playing this game also . try it you will love it also .
playing this game is really fun because there is a story line to follow and the hidden items are not extremely hard to find . have good time .
good game ... do n't like to buy coins ... good time waster if your bored ... . a little too easy for adults but good learning game for kids .
just started playing this a day or so ago . the early rounds are easy but it gets hard - though not so hard that you give it up . challenging & amp ; addictive ! !
i think this game is pretty good is easy to learn how to play and it 's challenging but not too challenging so i 'm rating it 5 stars .
i love this game its so fun everybody should get it . i wish it was free though . it keeps u busy
i wish it kept stats and perhaps added a random phase quick game feature for when you really only have a few moments .
started playing and could not stop ! each level brings different challenges . great graphics . first few levels are really easy to beat !
it 's a decent app . i rather use the one finger instead of the buttons . i got this app for free . works fine on my kindle fire hd .
great hidden object on my kindle fire ! ! would highly recommend this game for anyone who loves hidden objects ! ! great job big fish ! !
this is a wonderful little time killer that just gets under your skin until you figure out the system for each level . it gets progressively tougher as you level and keeps your attention quite nicely .
this is a good game , although at sometimes i just ca n't seem to get into it . to be fair , i have n't had much time to play it .
i downloaded this for my 3 year old not knowing how much he would be interested in this , but he seems to enjoy it a lot . he really likes to play with this and count along .
if you love bingo then you will love this game . powerups and all kinds of surprises make it fun . it 's one of my favorites .
it may be for 9 and younger but for someone who 's not good at playing the piano it definitely helps . i enjoyed playing songs on it . it 's small but is a good time waster
i really enjoy playing this game . it is rather addicting . i would recommend it to all of my friends . it would be nice it did n't require internet access .
this game required too much data that i was willing to use , this game would be perfect , if it did n't require soon much data !
i love it . it is just this so easy and good quality app . if you just give it a minute it will load from your kindle fire 's gallery .
the game is challenging but gets rather boring with out a challenge to over come i would rather see the letters change .
if you like a lot of hidden objects this game is for you ! it 's got lots plus many challenging puzzles looking forward to the sequel
i have hulu , so it is a great distraction for me at work during my lunch time and that 's all i ever wanted .
ok so there are ads but you can skip them press the x button in the corner and the skip button will come up i have no problem with it i 'm really people stop complaining
love these games but the time i spent downloading it was n't worth the time i spent playing it . very short .
i love puzzles and these r good and challenging . i 'm having a blast . my kids like it too . you will enjoy this game
i love solitaire , and this is definitely the best one out there . it 's easy to use and i love the multiplayer mode .
i love this game its fun and cool i wish there were more ! ! ! ! ! ! this game is super cute i love the panda and the penguin
i got this one for my husband to play . he loves pool and says the game is fun . the colors on the kindle fire hdx make this one gorgeous too .
i play this often and enjoy it more each time i play . i would encourage anyone to download it . lots of fun .
i think this is a great game . so far i am doing pretty darn good but it does slowly get harder . i just enjoy the game . try it out i think most people would like it .
as someone that 's played a lot of card games , this one is awesome ! have n't had any problems at all . easy to read
i love this game so much ! ! ! i feel like i have a real pet and everything . and it 's so much fun to do too . : )
this is a very fun game and really neat to play . i have played all 4 levels and won most of them .
fantastic game . keeps you playing and playing . recommend to purchase . i really enjoy playing this game . good for the mind .
great app really fun reminds me of pokemon from when i was a child can not wait to reach a higher level
i put it on my kids tablet because he asked . i never played it and now i am hooked . installed easy .
google search is okay but i much prefer to use it on my computer and will continue to do so .
ca n't really review since it wont load up . it will try to install but it crashes . it has bugs need fixing .
everyone in the family enjoy playing this game we like the games that is available for us to play thank you .
i love angry birds space . it 's so addictive . it 's one of the best games around for children and adults . : - )
i enjoy playing bingo . this game is fun but i would like it . much more if it was not always hitting me to buy .
this game is so addicting and fun i ca n't put it down . works very well on my kindle fire . the graphics are awesome and the objectives give you something to work towards . love it .
on kindle it says . when you type a word there is no enter button so i do n't know what to do
thought i found a nice free app to give me some workout ideas , but it seems like everything cost on this app . the only thing free is the download .
a great little game for dragon lovers . i would prefer it to have a bit more to it , but they are still working on it .
good radio app to have . stations f all types of people . you will love this app and use it all the time day and night . at home are in the car .
my little girl will be on it for days trying to get past it but she loves it . it is the best game ever
this is a very good app . it is well designed and it works very well with the original kindle fire . i recommend that you give it a try .
the kids really enjoy this game . it is different and challenging . felt it needed a few more instructions but once they figured it out they loved it .
i do not recommend that you get this game because there 's nothing fun about it . and there is nothing you can do about it .
i 've not found a way to check to see if i am right or if i need to make a change . it may just need better directions .
great graphics & amp ; cute puzzles . fun to play . good idea with the titanic as the background . would recommend . to anyone
this is another game that is good for young reader and for adults . it is exercise for the brain in a fun way
the name made me laugh but i enjoy playing it after work or with my niece when i 'm at home she makes the sound while i play games i enjoy this product
top free games means its supposed to be for free . the kf apps suck too there is nothing fun yet
man i got the game and it was fun for a day that 's why i recommend you to play ice age village it 's way better so i just wan na say this game is junk its crap
i 'm glad that candy crush has finally come to the great variety of games available on the kindle . it is an awesome and addictive game !
it works like your browser messenger . i like that its exactly what i expect and works the way i want every time .
subway surfers ! ! ! i love this game . ca n't stop playing this . have to get it
i had fun playing this one and my 4 year old really enjoys feeding candy to the lil green monster
unlimited difficulties that you control ! will keep you as busy as you want . what else could you want for free ? works flawlessly ! worth money even if not free !
this game is additive and well worth 5 stars but you have to leave room for improvement . i find myself playing this instead of reading .
wonderful game to spend some time , awesome rpg cant get any better . i need more games like this ... any more ideas for the kindle fire
the game looked nice , but i could n't find a zoom feature ( which i need ! ) on my tablet some objects were to small to find .
i did the nails right and they get mad . i have no clue why they get mad . do not get this game ! ! !
this games really give you a chance to make your brain work , and i like it better then brain games .
my grandson wants the game it wo n't load . i tried three times . other games load not this one . he would likes the game .
this game is the right balance between creepy and addictive . it has really good graphics and a very good storyline .
keeps stopping , just like the scrabble , which is not a good game either . a lot of these free games just waste your time when you could be reading or playing something more interesting .
what more can you say about it ? it does what it does . i 'm very happy with this app ! if anyone is n't happy with , must be looking for a different type of app .
i like the game but seem to run out of & quot ; energy & quot ; before i want to stop playing . and i refuse to pay for things . other than that game is fun .
i love this game . whoever uses my kindle always plays it too . it is very addictive and play it everyday .
i really enjoy playing this game as it makes you need to use your brain to figure out the plays .
super fun and kinda hard at first . loved it so much . this game is very fun to play and i love playing it when i can .
great game ! ! ! you get to do a lot on this game from arcade to cooking . you have to pass games to get points . overall very fun ! !
i love this one ! i have played this on facebook , but love the mobile much better ! highly recommending ! ! ! download & amp ; enjoy !
this game is so fun . you should really get this game . my only complaint is that there should be more levels . other than that , it 's great !
if you like a challenge you 'll like this app . some are easy some are hard still thinking is always good .
neither of my grandsons ages 6 and 8 are interested in this one . they have only tried it once . i guess there is not enough action for them .
me and my sisters love to bakery story on our kindle fires . we even have each others as neighbors . to anyone i suggest you get the game .
i like this version and it still entertains the toddlers . we were disappointed that the kindle does n't support the star wars version but this is good too .
like the android app . easier to get to ebay and check on things . told several friends about it and i believe they got it also .
this game is so fun and so addictive ! i ca n't stop playing ! i love playing against so many other people
this is really a nice little app . works just like the puzzles you used to do on the card table .
got this for my 2 year old and he loves it . my 7 year old plays it every now and then too .
lots of funny love it challenge enough for the mind free version plus the $ 1.99 purchase does n't have enough levels to enjoy
i 'm so glad i can finally i can play this game without having to look around the ads . great game and very addicting .
i downloaded this for myself . i love playing mahjong and word games in general . my eleven year old grand daughter also likes playing it
this game is very fun and addicting . it 's a great game to play when your board . i seriously recommend this game .
i like the game very much .i like playing . i would recommend it to anyone who love to play word games
this is a fun hidden object game that is very clear on my new 8 & # 34 ; tablet . graphics are great and i would recommend this to anyone who likes ho 's .
i would have given it a half but i was generous it sucks you can barely do anything they should pay u t o play it just do n't buy it
i find the songs i like and enjoy i really recommend this to you get it it so free i recommend it real bad
l love playing quell ... lots of fun ! ! ! it makes you use your mind and challenges you to see how well you can think .
this game is really boring and does not capture my attention for long . do n't buy it , its dumb . i was lucky i got it for free .
this app sucks if you have a fire it cant tell if i 'm touching the screen or not and its very slow . do n't waste your time i deleted it right away .
this is one of my favorite games on my kindle . it is very challenging and fun . the only thing that i would have to complain about is that there are n't that many free games .
this has been a every helpful tool especially when looking up word i can not find in the bible 's dictionary 's , is awesome to have around
be warned this game is more than addicting . at first i thought this game was going to be boring but wow was i wrong .
this game is very good . you have to know your cars . mainly the foreign cars . its very challenging and educational
again i did not enjoy this slot . but , someone else might like it . gave it a try for a few weeks .
it does have alot of different styles to pick from . try it out i am sure you will enjoy it . samsung epic
this game is fun and challenging . its nice because you do n't have to wait for your friend to make a move like the popular scrabble games out there .
if you were hoping to find a pocket check register that does n't even need you to find a pen , here it is . you can load and enter everything and know where you stand when .
not the best camera in the world . the camera that comes in the diary app is better . but not too bad
very nice and relaxing . very even and easy pace . the music in the background is well paced with the game .
it failed to download after trying 3 times , so i uninstalled it . it seemed to hard to install and asked too many questions before it would complete the installation .
used it one time to scan a smart ad and never used it again . i probably could have used it more .
i love this game . makes you really think about things . there are some that are a little hard to do but still a lot of fun .
ca n't beat the price , many settings , options , easy fun , different levels , some screens were good , others were kinda lame & stupid , all & all , it 's worth playing .
downloaded for my great granddaughter and i do n't think its what it says or does what what i expected . do n't waste your kindle space .
great game and a little challenging ! ! ! ! i love it and its sooooo addicting . i would play all night if i could ! ! ! ! get this game ! ! ! ! ! ! !
brain teasers for all situations - good on the go , great when you have time to fill , like in the airport or in a traffic jam
able to watch movies and some television shows on the go when i travel . definitely would recommend this app if you already subscribe to netflix .
this game will kill time , but it is nothing exciting or worth writing home about . play it if you have nothing better to do .
fun to play , with some challenges , but it 's not too hard ! = ) you can get through quite a few levels fairly quick .
highly recommend ! ! more app then expected , money well spent . can do endless hours and so many possibilities . i feel like a kid in a candy store ... lol
nice game and really cool graphics . plays very easily . i got it for free , but would pay for this game .
i got this app for my grandkids to play with . it 's totally useless , does nothing , and had no point . or ... i just did n't use it right ? ? you decide .
i have been looking for a free slot game that i could play without having to buy more credits and so far i havent spent any real cash
this game is free in the google play store . at the very least they should have removed the ads on this paid application for amazon .
it is a amazing game ... it is awesome design they create and it is mostly cool game go play so i suggest u try this game ...
this app is the best ever and i love games like this go get the game u will like it so much
not very fond of this game because there seems to be no method to it and not a lot of brain use
i did n't really care too much for this game . it was fun the first couple times but after that it kind of got boring .
playing g this on a kindle fire . graphics are beautiful . i played this before on a laptop but it 's so much better on the kindle . well done
i love playing this app its so fun ! you should get this app its amazing . you should get it and play it passes the time !
this is a great app you create your own skin an you can download it to pc edition it really works on pc sadly not on pocket edition but other wise it 's great !
this game is a challenge to me , therefore i can play it and is a lot better than some of the other games i have tried
i love this game it is fun and relaxing easy to use just like the real slots great way to relax in the evening
love it . provides lots of laughs , kudos to the devs . ca n't wait to see their next project . who knew not playing a game would be so entertaining ?
love it . i would say it close to my favorite bingo game ! at least my second to favorite . this game keeps me up late !
i like it i finally found one that works well . it does what i want and finds the words i need !
my kids completed this game in a matter of minutes and were done with it . they wanted a new game . i will be more careful of my choices in the future .
.this is a relaxing game . i really enjoy playing it i play just to slow down my evening s. anyone can do it pretty easy game
this is a great game . very addictive but i love it . i start playing and have a hard time putting it down .
play it every day ! ! ! i live on a boat so i play with friends all over the country and keep in touch ! ! ! ! !
good game so far . not too hard yet , but i am not to far into the game . good game for the free price .
this app is very useful since its hard for me to get on a computer . i recommend this app to anyone who likes funny videos or music or any other kind of video .
seriously the best app i have ! i use it all the time ! fast and easy . this is the app for you . ; )
it is very cool because you can actually put all your favorite and private stuff in there like the best thing that 's ever happened to you .
i love this game but it needs to be free ! ! ! i looked at the pics and i got all the logos right ! everyone wants it to be free so get it free people !
so cool with the sounds and everything . supper awesome get this app i know you will enjoy it like me
very disappointed . i was unable to navigate through this app and i was unable to find what i wanted to watch .
this game is more of a game for a little kid to be playing . i thought it was cute but just not for me at all
i downloaded this app so that i could check out books from my local library . it 's the best thing i ever did for my kindle
definitely challenging ! this game gives an escape challenge . the clues are fun to find and makes you think where u might find them . i would recommend this game : )
this is a fun game i enjoy that you do n't have to work hard or pay out of pocket a lot to play
thought this would have better word searches . unfortunately they seem to use the same words over and over again . and really they have you search for a few words which leaves most of the letters not used .
needed something on my surprise gift ... kindle fire hd . this is a great game . play it while talking on the phone .
listen it 's not bad but not what i thought . i had it for a while but then it got really boring . this is a maybe app .
boring ... do n't understand the point of the game . more information would be helpful ... and a goal for playing the game . thank you .
particularly good game really hard to guess the logos though so good thing they gave us hints yay yeah this game rocks
someone may enjoy this game but it depends on your taste . i just happened to not enjoy it you may .
brings you back but wish you could skip and go back to it later . some things never seen before . needs more coins for solving .
this is sooooooooo much better than the original temple run . i love the new obstacles . i would highly recommend it .
i like the game but it just freezes up on me when i try to move on to the next level so its really annoying but the game works fine .
more then just hidden object scenes . this game is great and never boring . you can flip from puzzles to hidden objects and so much more . plenty of variety .
its not as much fun as some of the other hidden objects games i have . my grandson does not play it very much and i base my rating on him
i do n't understand this game . i tried to find instructions and was not able to follow how the game should be played . it looks like it would be fun if i could figure it out .
a fun card game . this helps to improve your skills and strategies . simple and fast paced , i find it relaxing .
this game reminds me of the atari games . good for game for all ages . easy controlling on kindle fire . way to go developers
i found that all ages will enjoy this game . my grand kids to me we all enjoy all the angry bird games
have seen on t.v . got it on my kindle , grandkids and i all have fun playing it . i think you will find it fun .
this is a fun app get it it 's very fun do n't like the advertising at all fun though and entertaining
if you like to play bingo , you will probably like this app . it is a lot of fun . however , it tends to lock up quite a bit .
this game is adorable , but i 'd enjoy it a lot more if i could exit the item store without having to exit and reload the game ...
love the graphics and games ! ! super fun and very addictive the only thing is that i run out of coins ... lol
if you like bingo games , this one is just as straight forward as the rest of them . i like it ... its fun .
a fun game that everyone can love . the only problem was when changing the background it sticks and does not respond . however it never stops me from having fun
it is a great game . i love playing it for hours and hours all night long day or night . that is how much fun it is
did n't know how i gave it a bad review before . love the app . works great on kindle fire hd . the remote feature and being able to watch tv on kindle great ! !
my son loves dinosaurs , and this app is good for telling him the name of them with a picture . he does n't care for the coloring pages , and gets bored quick with it .
is just a basic time management game ... is cute , but repetitive . i uninstalled 10 minutes later due to lack of interest
i use this app on a weekly basis to find local sales and organize shopping trips . i would highly recommend this app to anyone .
i have n't gotten very far into it yet , its been a challenge having to start over and trying to get just alittle bit further each time .
game is great , i even play it on my android phone , and never have had a problem with it ... .. awesomeness ! ! !
great game . enjoy the speed so you can play 4 cards easily . like watching the cat too ! the graphics are n't typical . feels like you 're on vacation !
this is a great utility to have for your kindle . it gets rid of junk files that slow down your tablet .
i love this `` game '' . there have not been any technical problems with it . would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes word games .
it 's addictive . i play all the time . wish it were easier to get coins to play though . otherwise it 's a good game to pass time .
one of the better free games i 've played . the ai does some dumb things but overall i recommend it . it seems good for kids too .
i did n't see a difference in between this angry birds and any other version that was out there . it was a decent game , and it was exactly what i expected it to be .
i have tried to play some of the action games on my tablet and in my opinion , puzzle games are about the best for tablets period .
its pretty entertaining , tic tac toe is n't my favorite game but it kept me playing for alittle . i play it every now and then
i love this game its a must buy game its addicting and hard u must get the game its so fun
me and my family love this game we play it alot . it takes alot of brain power for each level .
this app is awesome . i do n't really like city building games but this is just awesome . if your a simpson 's fan you 'll really love this app . get it now .
i think that this app is awesome ! i can text my friends for free and i can also just hang out
it 's very very cool you should try this i 'm going to and i love it it 's a must have get it it 's a good game for children 8 and up
i love this game and i love the movie too ! it 's awesome , everyone should try this game . just like the movie !
just . was not the one i wanted . was looking for one i had on my old ipod , this was n't it .
have not used it as of yet . have used pdf on my pc will use it in the future . thanks
cute idea but things take to long to do and things are to expensive . graphics are nice and the music is ok .
this game is very entertaining . it was hard for me to stop playing so i could write this review . the story plot is good and i like how it keeps you going and wanting more .
well i actually think that basically everything is pretty nice on this besides one huge fact , which is the controls just plain suck . everything else is good but i would n't suggest getting this game .
this is really nice if you need to know a few words in spanish . its nice for children . i love it .
there are a few puzzles that offer a good challenge to earn three stars . i am still working on them .
i love this game so so much i used to play this game on my iphone but now i can play it on my kindle fire thank u amazon appstore
i like this game because it relaxes me after a stressful day at work . you do n't have to think to hard to connect the dots .
excellent movie . i have watched it a few different times and it always keeps me on the edge of my seat .
in my quest to buy as many christmas movies as possible i found a gem in this one . quite the twist in the end that makes this movie worth purchasing .
my husband and i love this show . i ca n't wait till they put all the seasons onto dvds so we can get every episode .
this was excellent , could n't stop watching , had to watch all discs to finish it . the only sad thing is that it ended that part of the saga , and there was n't any more .
i think this is a great show . mike is correct ... somebody 's got ta do it . i have learned much from watching mike dig into some very dirty and sometimes dangerous jobs .
i have watched lots of movies about this queen and this was well done . great costumes , scenery and story . they are each different in detail but interesting . i really liked this version .
these were all great . i loved the show when it was on tv . then i watched them all again on netflix . now i can watch them whenever i want . thank you for having them available .
a must have for your christmas movie collection , funny , entertaining and a great story line .
this was a gift for my cousin and i hope she like it , enjoy workout with this dvd it will be her first time to this one she would like it ! ! !
my mother was reading this book and i just had to check out the movie . cheesy , but a good message . i would watch it again , for the whole family .
i have this dvd and absolutely love it ! i enjoyed this star wars cartoon series as a child and still do today ! !
tom and jerry have alot of good and funny cartoons that you can watch more than once i recommend it
just a few good action scenes and a few dialog / suspence scenes . the plot was fairly solid . the acting is a little stiff in this movie , but all considered , it was an ok time .
at first i did n't think i was going to like this kind a movie . i knew i was going to enjoy kevin hart 's comedic acting . he did a great job .
did not know anything about it so i watch it and liked it . i do recommend plus it was free .
this film version stands as my all-time favorite of the genre and perhaps the entire 70s . i will enjoy this one for a lifetime .
this is a cartoon kind of movie done with real people . a great cast is the one thing that really makes this film . the humor is a little dated but funny .
peter jackson has done it again . one of my favorite movies of all time . i love a long movie that is not rushed , wish they all were 3 hours plus .
was expecting more like the book . i did n't like the casting much either . was okay but not the best in my opinion
i love all the old time shows that you ca n't get on tv so i am purchasing this collection and i am almost there .
my daughters had fun watching superman . it allowed me to share pleasant childhood viewing with them when i watched it over with them .
good times , second season seem to deal with more issues that are real and part of everyday life .
i liked the screen play and the actors but the language was messed with not at all close to what is written in the bible
this was a gift purchase . i have heard no complaints so this blu-ray must have been in good shape . cant wait to view it !
i really like gerard butler as an actor , he does a good job . he taught the young man great lessons in life .
glad to finally have the complete show all the seasons are great . one of the best shows ever love it
excellent show . house is very funny . this is my favorite show and i watch the episodes over and over . highly recommend it .
perfect in three parts , though number 3 left a lot to be desired . author should have stopped at two . good addition to my collection .
this is my absolute favorite movie of all time -- - i love richard gere ! julia roberts gives a perfect performance of grace and style in this movie -- - a must have for romance individuals .
i 'd never saw it in hd before and am glad i bought it ! ( and this is a much better film then the remake ) .
i bought this collection after i saw indiana 4 , it was great deal for fun movies
bought this as a gift . they loved it . i would recommend this to anyone who was into this type of stuff .
i use to watch is everytime it would snow with my brother when we were younger . i am so happy they put it on dvd . it really gets you into the holiday spirit !
good , just like i remembered it as a kid growing up . story ahead of its time but fairly accurate for today .
as always denzel comes through with his performance in this film . good , strong cast of characters and a good plot . i would recommend this film for anyone who enjoy bourne or similar type movies .
excellent movie . i first saw on tv , wanted a copy , waited 8 years to get a dvd of it . love the movie . a great story , a happy ending , and nice people throughout .
it kept both the adults and children entertained . it really is a great movie . it 's funny & kind of heartwarming
my movie collection is growing . all my favorites from days gone by . i can watch them over and over . thanks
interesting premise , but i just couldnt get into it . i dont know why but i just couldnt . they are making either a sequal or a follow up .
my favorite in the world of comedy . even if the scenes and events are not that funny , larry 's character always is . love the man .
if you 're a halloween or michael myers fan , this must be a part of your collection . great typical slasher horror movie !
great movie . very entertaining . great mixture of action , horror , sexual tension , and comedy . my favorite kind of movie . i bought it so i could watch it again .
it 's probably the best action movie of all times . extremely enjoyable to watch . just so cool ! i watched it on netflix and going to buy my copy now . wow
i love this movie when i was a child i watched it repeatedly . i bought it for my niece she loves it and always talks about sarah .
denzel is always a joy to watch ; but this movies was just not what i expected . this movie is more a personal drama .
as usual , i am satisfied with everything . i received the product in a timely manner . thanks
when i purchased the dvd of this i received this instant video , have n't seen this so i am unable to rate it .
the second season does not disappoint , you are introduced to new characters and learn new things about the old ones . i like the writing and that there are a lot of episodes .
this is a great snow storm movie . this is a more believeable spin on the classic tale . the scenery is fantastic . a definite see again .
very interesting concept . fun to watch , exciting at times and thought provoking . good entertainment , however not an award winner . worth a look .
a great movie with lots of jokes and a great cast . i highly recommend this video . it 's nice to see something this inventive not based on a comic book .
this was a movie i had been wanting to see for several years , but somehow missed over the years . i 'm glad i finally got to watch it as it was well worth the wait .
the cast of characters , their adventures , the acting , writing and setting all combine to make this quite possibly the best show on tv anywhere ever !
i enjoyed this series when i was younger it was fun to repeat the experience all over again thanks for it
i bought this as a christmas present ( surprise ) for my mom . we both love law & order , and were not disappointed at all .
not just for kids . this is one of my favorite files . the message , the entertainment , the animation . love it all
a is a great movie with a good story line . this movie is more for a more mature audience . thanks , bobby j .
i love , love , love these videos . such a wonderful story . i had put off buying these for a long time & just decided it was time . thanks so much ! !
this is a classic snl . i love the movie and was pleased to find it new and for a great price . it arrived very quickly , packaged well and has been a wonderful addition to my collection .
this is a really fun movie . i have watched is many times . its a keeper .
this movie has the best car chases and is full of action . this one will also keep you on your toes and is a great classic .
my grandkids and me loved this movie . its funny , colorful . my grandkids and me saw it a couple of times again . and when we want laugh we look it up .
very nice touching movie . animations are getting better and better . getting them through amazon is great . prices are good and delivery times are wonderful .
i have read the book and it was great , but this made me cry . a very wholesome movie that i recommend to anyone .
this was one of the first movies i saw with my children . i would by this for sentimental reasons . two thumbs up !
great to finally see a version of this with good picture and sound . even though it has it 's corny spots , it 's still fun to watch .
recently started watching this series , and it is super cute . a little over dramatic at some points , but that 's the point . good series .
loved tom selleck in this movie , saw it on cable and had to get it , his role looked so real .
very enjoyable movie and very well done . i 'm an adult but i really liked it - so it 's not just for kids . very nice to look at too on a good hd tv .
i like the effects and the monsters . i hope when they make a sequel they will have vampires and werewolves that does n't look like those in underworld movie .
do not watch this film by yourself . must be watched in a group or you will shoot yourself .
my kids and me just love this movie . it is a great family christmas movie to watch as a family ! ! !
a good movie for all , i bought this movie so i could watch it with my kids . to my surprise it entertained me also .
this is the way movies should be put together and all can enjoy and be a family that can watch a movie together and teach good moral ways also
the golden girls is one of the best american tv sitcoms ever made . every fan should have all nine seasons on dvd !
a great story ... notice the all star cast , and good acting ( as always ) by robert redford . worth the time , worth the $
this series was a gift to my dad , who loved the show when it was on tv . he was very happy with it .
this is the one actor movie i have ever watched . could have been just a little better , but turned out great
i recomend this movie to all s f fans . it has great special effects , especially in three dee . good flick .
great movie , a classic , i like it , great characters , the ending is worth the whole flick you will love the ending
i really like naruto . it came on time . i really happy with it . i would tell my friends about it .
an incredible movie ! a must see ! i cant remember the actors name , but the one who plays his business partner was fabulous .
i have never had an issue with any of the dvd 's i have purchased , and i have purchased quite a few . i am a satisfied customer .
good movie , the plot was a lot better than i expected , i never read the book , so i really did n't know what to expect .
do n't know how i missed this one . was a treat to watch . funny and sharp . do n't have comics like this anymore
same as season 1 , just more depth to characters . still a good series
condition was perfect as promised . arrived on time , very happy with product . price was the best i could find for blue ray .
enjoyed this one , richard gere is at his best as usual . you ca n't go wrong with most any of his movies .
from a time when actors had to act and special effects were generated from within . you feel you could have lived next door .
this is just the best movie and remains a classic for all of the member of the family to enjoy .
i would recommend this movie . we found it `` fun '' , humorous and enjoyed the plot even though it was not what we were expecting . it did flow well and kept our interest .
my husband and i thought this was a good family movie , there are n't many i would watch with grand kids .
old tom cruise love story , was very bored and wanted something to watch . the story was kind of shallow at points but it was still fun to watch .
this is a good way to get 3 bruce willis films . all 3 are good movies . i got them at a good price , in new condition and on time .
both specific to time and culture and universal in its themes of love , family , work and purpose . i enjoyed every moment of this gem !
when i first saw the trailer , before it 's release . i thought , what is pixar up to ? they always come through with a beautifully animated , well executed story . i love this movie .
i enjoyed working out to this video and will continue using it for weight loss and to get in shape .
the latest in the fast and furious saga is a fast moving movie . very good special effects , the story is not bad either . tom
great remake ! we love the action in this movie as well as the special effects . not your old stallone movie !
what the heck ! i ca n't believe i actually sat through the whole thing . possibly worst movie i have ever seen .
just love the first and second seasons so it made sense to get the third . there are some really great moments in each episode with laugh out loud humor .
this could 've been alot better in my personal opinion . you ca n't take bruce willis ' mouth and cgi it onto joseph gordon 's face ! ! !
a wonderful movie for kids and the kid in all of us ! the first one is one of my favorite movies of all time .
i love shirley ! this is one of her best dramas vs. musical . her chemistry is good with robert young , and she even does well with foreign language . a must for a shirley temple collector .
this was a gift and i was so excited to know that someone still had a copy of this movie ! it came in top-notch condition and on time !
i love all the men in black movie and movies with tommy lee jones and will smith , they both are good actor and they just make the movies good and funny .
i enjoyed the first collection so much i decided i wanted to view the second collection . so far it is exactly what i expected .
this movie had the potential to be much better . i enjoyed it . however there was something lacking more action and a better story line it was n't great but it was n't terrible .
if you like real westerns like it should be , one of the best , and not one of these wan na be so called westerns , hey ! ! it do n't come any better then this ! !
love this movie ! ! ! it is sad ... but the ending is great . i am a huge tyler perry fan ! ! !
great show but i wish cbs would have put out a box set instead of cheap dvd case . anyone getting season 6 of walker will find out how cheap they have gotten .
finally , a film that tells a good story about what it means to be a family , with excellent writing and brilliant acting . this should be on everyone 's top ten must see list for the year .
did n't know if i would like the new sherlock holmes but found it very enjoyable ! great acting by benedict cumberbatch .
not my favorite spike lee movie , but near the top of his game ... this is a must see move . it 's history baby !
good movie it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it isnt was to t
this came out of no where for me . excellent character movie even though it is rather short . worth the purchase for me .
the whole sci-fi part of the movie was amazing . the graphics and effects were great too . me and my kids enjoyed this movie very much .
came across this and watched as soon as it arrived ! ! a must see for a baseball lover ! ! arrived on time with no scratches
a mix between mr. bean and masterpiece theatre . a bit odd , but we really enjoyed watching it and looking forward to watching more episodes .
it was a sad day for me when they just took csi : miami off the air . i really miss that show . it had really beautiful scenery , wonderful actors and good stories .
belly dance is great for all ages to do . i recommend it to anyone who wants to have fun and get fit .
this is a family favorite . i remember watching it as a kid and still love it . the songs are great and the dancing is so much fun , i miss this kind of movie : (
i like both versions equally . the original had atmosphere , the remake had better looking zombies . all in all , i highly recommend this movie . check it out !
usually movies get worse as they go , but we thought this one was even better than the first two . totally worth it !
perfect gift for someone i know who enjoys this show , and i watch it from time to time and see why he does like it
i am not a fan of live cd 's , i must say . but the fact that this came with a dvd also was awesome ! i love the music , but loved the dvd even more !
i did not like this and could not make it through the whole movie . there did n't seem to be a good story line or anything to hang on to keep me watching .
this is an edge of the seat movie with a lot of twists . hart to tell the good guys from the bad ones . i would recommend it .
good british fun and very true to life i lived in the uk and this was typical just a funny funny show
great music . i think it may be a personal taste . i enjoyed the rock guitar playing from some of the best players out there .
enjoy watching this series again and again . we are so happy it is available
great sci-fi movie . imo one of the best of the 50 's . good effects considering the time the movie came out .
seen it on tv and really wanted to add it to my collection not sorry for doing so fun to watch
was equal to the first in terms of its presentation of batman . i particularly liked the way they closed out the movie .
you have to be down with reading subtitles , but this is a really good movie . i love wwii period pieces anyway , and this is a good one .
very good and cute love movie . everyone woman would love to find her true love this way . must see this movie .
how could you not love this . they are some of the funniest movies ever made and are great for family viewing . i am going to share this with my mom . she loves it too !
great movie for both adults & children . definately a movie that i 'd watch again when stuck inside winter time .
i really loved the first movie , and i thought that this one was pretty awesome too .
i watch episodes from time to time late night when i wake up . it 's an enjoyable series and the acting is good
this is a captivating film that does a wonderful job of showing the nature of addiction and drugs . some of the most exciting editing i 've ever seen in a film as well .
this story brings a measure of comfort to families who have lost a son to war ... my collection is better since adding this dvd .
i really purchased this movie for our grandchildren . however , we watched and enjoyed it as well . this was a good family movie all around .
movie was bought as a gift for my son for christmas . i am replacing all his vhs tapes with dvd 's they arrived in good condition an on time . thank you .
got my dvd way ahead of schedule . brand new and not damaged or anything . no problems here . now i will enjoy it and laugh .
not overly great , but good . to see on pbs would have been better rather than buying it . i would only watch it once .
love this dvd ! disney did a great job on this one . the culture and music is classic
i liked this movie because not only was it silly funny but there was an actual story plot . also how can you go wrong with johnny depp .
so so story line . acting was okay but nothing special . good movie if you want to watch something and turn your brain off .
i can watch this type of show over and over again . now i am able to watch them whenever i want .
this was so adorable . just as cute as the first one , if not better . all the characters were adorable . there were just more of them .
i have always liked this movie and especially james dean . it is one of my very favorites from my youth .
these three movies kept me hanging on to every scene . i watched all three in one night . really enjoyable . great plot
get on your dancing shoes and enjoy this old time favorite . my mom loves every minute of it . you will too .
excellent workout . really gets the heart rate up . i love the step routines and the ball routines .
it was a funny movie . i enjoyed . it had the awe factor at the end . good date type movie
this was a very charming movie . although somewhat predictable , ginger rogers delivers a vintage performance along with several great supporting cast members .
i have not watch yet because i just got the movie today but im sure i will enjoy because all the other movie i got i enjoy them
love it ! the dry wit and humor is addicting . i am trying to catch all seasons . wonderful programming for sure !
took my a few shows to get hooked . michael fox was surprisingly entertaining throughout . come on season 4 , become free . i ca n't see paying for these shows as there is so much other content .
this is a great movie all of your favorite characters are back in this third installment of the series . this movie rocks
arrived on time . nice to share my favorite childhood movies with my kids .
the storylines were good and the acting was amazing . the two main characters were very likable and i found myself rooting for them .
dvd was in new condition , arrived promptly , well packed , what can i say ? what 's to complain . i would highly recommend this vendor based on my experience .
i just found it stupid , not well written or funny . i too like one reviewer i saw could n't sit through 30 minutes of it .
i enjoyed this movie a lot . i would recommend this movie to anyone who i know . i think anyone would like it .
sandra bullock performance is sexy and great as usual and the whole movie is very entertaining . i have always enjoyed her movies and performance in them .
when this came out , nothing compared . action , story , great acting and thoughtful . it could have gone anywhere and people paid attention . everyone would probably want to see it at least once .
this was a rare find for me . i love this movie . the best collection of actors in a movie . thank you
this is a light humorous romance movie . it is obviously not meant to be taken seriously . yes , the plot is weak and the script could have been better but it is still an entertaining little film .
nothing to say . this movie is what it is . you like it or you do n't .
this was an enjoyable move for the whole family . my twin daughters really like it and watched it several times with friends .
i thought the movie was visually beautiful and the story line was entertaining . i would recommend the movie for children .
adorable with a powerful message ! we loved this so much that we went to watch it twice at the movies and then bought the dvd . : )
alfred hitchcock is number one and no one will ever top him ! i am so pleased to add this to my large collection of alfred hitchcock ! : )
great action film and entertaining . i love the fact he really cares about her . sweet and romantic from such a tough guy ! !
cant wait to see part 2 and finally the ending of this series ! ! ive been waiting a long time ! ! .
a great dvd . excellent audio and video quality . this is a really good copy of an old tv show . enjoy ! !
good movie thank you it was good i had the first american werewolf and decided to buy this about now
funny adventure story with danny devito at his best . a blast from the past and well worth watching . i highly recommend it .
the acting in this film is excellent as is the cast of actors . the story is well-written and believable . the dynamics between characters as well as the action keeps the film interesting to the end .
excellent film over all , well acted . if you enjoy period films , or are a big jane austen fan you will really enjoy this adaptation .
it is a little dated and overly familiar , but still just as wonderful as you remember it . really worth watching again .
a little slow in the beginning but when it starts to pick up it is very good . great acting by the cast . i do recommend this one .
this film combines the fun and excitement of a hollywood thriller with the accuracy of a documentary . it is memorable , well acted and superbly directed .
i thought that this movie was very well done , and it was very funny . good movie for the whole family . ages 2 and up .
this was a very good movie , the music and dancing was absolutely beautiful . it 's a very beautiful tragic love story . performances are very good and though confusing at times , i enjoyed it .
this has got to be one of the funniest shows out there now , and to own one of the many seasons to come is a relief in the fact that comedy is still here .
i loved all of the episodes and was sad when it was all over ! ! ! i wish there was another season !
this is a great movie ! i had the first one and purchased this one for my collection and really enjoyed it . i hope they come out with another ! recommend this dvd highly ! ! !
it is one of my favorite movies . very well done . it is an excellent cast . would n't change a thing about it .
i love almost everything audrey hepburn starred in . this is no exception . and cary grant and audrey together are great .
i still need to take the time and sit down and watch this . i purchased it just to have more christmas movies and i just have n't found the time to watch yet .
this is one of woody allen 's funniest movies . you will find yourself laughing from the very first scenes to the very last .
awesome movie ! really like the actor from previous movies i seen with him . great purchase , highly recommend checking this movie out !
this has to be one of my top 10 movies of all time . great story and well thought out and acted characters . cant say enough about this movie .
i still wonder how this earned him an oscar . but , after a second viewing , i think i find the movie more interesting . still not sure if it was worthy an oscar .
i love this show , it is so funny and the characters are great . i was so happy to get this as it completed the series for me .
i enjoy the movie you should give this a watch in the future . this movie is worth purchase . come and view this 5 star movie in the future .
thought this was gon na be corny and just a big look at me , look at me movie for the aging action hero 's . but it turned out to be a good movie , i would recommend .
great movie ; i enjoyed all three of the iron man series . great rendition of the comic book hero 's of the past .
great true story . shows what you can do with hard work and lots of caring . shows morals and what you can do if you try .
i like funny movies and im glad it came on time , it was at an awesome affordable price , yes i recommend it

i kept putting it off , now i 'm super happy to own it . i 've already watched it 4 times since it arrived . & # 60 ; 3
it was terrific but did n't quite live up to the first film . very fun movie but lacked focus at times . in spite of that , i loved the story , the performances and the special effects .
nice movie just like you were at the movie back in the day . good action not a remastered version but still a good picture you will have fun if you like these type of movies .
although a very sad story , this was a really intense , and interesting movie . angelina lives up to her best performances , as usual .
this is one of jeff bridges ' best movies . the story is perfect for him . i enjoyed every moment in this adventure .
great show i remember watching growing up in the 90s ! decent acting and story lines and overall an entertaining show !
we are both very big fans of this show . i was so excited to have found it on here to buy and will definitely buy more ! !
awesome episodes , i would suggest all who like batman to buy this product . best episodes of the series in my opinion .

have not opened the set yet . i expect no problem with the dvd 's , however . that 's all i have to comment on .
this is an amazing movie , i love it because it is one of the few movies you can watch again and again .
i bought seasons one , two , and three of the big bang theory what fun . i have laughed and laughed . if your looking something light and funny you will love these dvd 's . enjoy
enjoying my jerry lewis movies , this one is funny and you will love it . makes you laugh all the way . its a must see movie
another wacky adventure of the summer wine crew . the comedy has changed a little for the new characters but it is still fun and engaging .
great , my grand daughter loved it and i loved these also . keeps your interest and i want to see over and over again .
this was funny in parts but mostly silly and boring to us . would not recommend this to anyone over 16 as teens still find this stuff entertaining !
i have all of the previous movies and was awaiting this one . i love the entire series and it lived up to my expectations .
my mother purchased this series and i like the cosby show but watching it on tv is enough for me . i do not need the videos at home . my parents both really enjoy the series .
highly recommended for those who are into war flicks . good suspense , will watch it for years to come i 'm sure
i really loved this dvd . it has tons of amazing , hard to find , footage but it is for hardcore fans only as it will be boring to those that are not .
it is a very good movie , no nudity , lots of bad words but very good message
if you love 1960 's sci fi movies , get this one , they sets and imagery is excellent , great acting and a great plot !
this is based on actual events that took place in wwii . another great cast and the plot from real life ... ca n't ask for more .
this is a great story about two female friends during a very politically complex era . it was well worth the view .
because it 's fresh and very funny . it shows what a modern family is nowadays . no one is perfect but very real characters with a lot of humor in situations that often times are not humorous !
love the batman animated series . the best and is still the best after all these years from watching it years ago .
been years since i first saw this movie , again it was as funny as the first time i saw it ! !
terrible . the story is awful . i got sick like i was watching blair witch . cant say enough bad things about it .
another gift for my wife . we love the old disney movies - especially sharing them with our sons . no issues .
talk about your classics , this is it ! ! i love every bit of this movie and always hated having to wait to see it one time only . now i can see it whenever i want
i very much enjoyed watching this series and believe i may even rewatch it time and time again . very enjoyable with a little of everything thrown together , humor , love , drama etc .
maybe it was the mixture of antonio banderas with madonna or that the music was bland to me , but i did n't enjoy this movie at all .
i really like this movie . scary movie 1 and 2 are my favorites . its so hilarious .
this was good film . it would have been better if it was in the native tongue and subtitled .

it was my family member 's gift for christmas . i gave it a try to watch and loved it so much . i thought it was funny and romantic in the different culture and race ...
movie was recommended by a friend . loved the production and especially the music score . very appropriate to the original story
shaw brothers are the greatest martial arts movie directors of all time ! have n't watched this yet but i 'm sure it will be good !

a movie i wanted and i know we will all enjoy watching this . disney makes great movies for the family .

very interesting with a great cast . action , surprises , felt authentic . worthwhile story . i would recommend this movie to anyone interested in art and wwii .
love this series . every episode is better than the last . leaves you always wondering who is going to turn bad next .

because i really like it , i would recommend it to my niece i like the part the human came friends
wow , this was sooooo entertaining ! ! ! it was really a tense thrilling movie , and hackman did a great job . loved it totally !
this is another movie i bought as a gift . my dad really likes this movie , it was a good deal .
stupid movie , in my opinion . could have been funny , with the cast they had , but ended up too predictable and silly .

was a good movie and enjoyed watching it . the main characters mom was too funny in this storyline and laughed alot .

it was time to replace our three mummy dvd 's with the better blu-ray copies . i 'm glad we did , the quality of the blu-ray movies are fantastic !
not your usual mark wahlberg movie . funny with adult humor and language not a kids movie . ted is so cute .
got this for my wife . she loves the characters and the drama . all in all it is a good series .
not as good as i was expecting , but the movie has some funny parts . i was expecting more humor based on the cast and trailers .
i got my movie pretty quick ! and enjoyed watching it ! it played great and brought back memories ! love my 80s movies ! i will definitely buy more soon ! cate
great movie ! a movie i remember seeing in the movie theaters ! i like these actors very much and these types of stories are intriguing to me !
entertaining and well worth the price . who knew the oscar of the muppets could direct such a funny movie . you will laugh at this one
these are some of the best episodes in the whole series , but why buy this when you could by the whole seasons ?
having purchased previous performances by this heavy metal band and being disappointed , i was thrilled with this one -- excellent in every way !
the kids enjoyed the movie ! they are on a roll to watch the series . the video quality was clear and we had no viewing issues .
the cinematography was lovely but the plot fell flat . i did not enjoy the movie at all . i would not waste my time on it if i were you .
it was just ok. was expecting more . might just give it to my neighbor . there is better stuff out there i am sure .
tom hanks is my favorite actor . well done movie , in fact i am watching it right now . i loved the book and the movie holds true to it .
love the beatles and all the solo stuff as well . this is a nice ride down memory lane . he was quite the spirit .
great as the first two seasons ! ! ! ! ! grabs you and keeps you wanting more ! ! what is walter going to do next ? ?
i bought this for myself after watching it several times on our movie channels . great movie i highly suggest getting it or at least seeing it
a must have ! the collection looks great and the movie itself is amazing . easily in the top 10 movie favorites for me and i 'd recommend to any real japanese movie fans .
my whole family loves this show and we even listen to the intro music , which some of us know by heart . thanks will smith !
what can i say ? i have been a fan of this series from day one and will continue to be a fan . have all of the seasons so far and ca n't wait to order season 5
they just do n't make shows like this anymore ! a great cast and fine writing make this show a treat to watch !
im starting my collection of the seasons of martin an i cant wait for season four to come to my house
movie was received before promised time . i say this movie is a classic and anyone who loves good movies , this one i highly recommend . excellent movie .
here i got again with another wonderful western told with errol flynn in the lead . will always keep this movie so i can watch it again .
really surprised that i had not heard of this one before finding it on amazon . definitely a pleasant surprise . thought the twists were great and a caught me off guard . watch it .
they could have done a better job with this . the real story has so much to offer . this movie is not worth the time
great christmas cartoon for the whole family to watch . and a great way to introduce the bible to the younger children , and grandchildren .
a great show with some great cinematic bits . i love the way it 's filmed and the plots this season were a lot of fun !
i really enjoyed the premise of this movie . the thought that you need time to live & stop aging at the age of 21 ? is a quite interesting draw .
i myself found this movie to be very interesting and entertaining nothing lie i had expected . was informative and would recommend to others .
glad that amazon has it available for us to see . hope to watch all of the seasons on my ipad
best family sitcom ever . we love watching with our kids and enjoy laughing together . we love the box sets , makes it easier and more enjoyable .
my older kids like this movie but my younger ones had never seen it until easter sunday and now it is one their favorites
a good funny move for the whole family to enjoy ; if you 've watched them all or you just watch this one it 's funny on its own .
bad boys i saw this movie about 3 years ago this was a good movie i 'm 15 this was one of my best movies
i like both of the main characters in this movie . i love thrillers . this one kept my attention the whole movie .
my 6 year old son loves this movie and i found it very fun to watch as well . it is one of our newer favorite movies .
volume 1 was great and exciting to watch . do n't buy volume 2 unless you need something to put you to sleep .
excellent period mystery , not up to agatha christie , but enjoyable . i find that the mystery is n't what draws me to this series but how well done that the historical era is done .
i thought i may have seen this before but i was wrong . good movie . easy to follow . makes me wish i had a place to escape the usual routine of the week .
this show kept me laughing in a very hard week i was having . i you want to laugh this is the show .
i love ginger roger 's acting . she 's delightful . this is an old favorite of mine . so glad it was available through amazon .
actually , my mom bought this movie for my father and so i have no idea what it 's about ... sorry to whoever is reading this but i hope to soon watch it : )
this is a great movie for an afternoon . popcorn , a drink and a relaxing place to seat and that 's all you need .
very entertaining movie . enjoyed seeing how the avengers came together . i recommend this video considering age appropriate , and very entertaining .
i hate that this was cancelled . i admit , it took me a while to get used to the characters , but when you do , you 're set . great show great cast . miss it .
this cartoon is a little off . i feel it is to dark for children . i even cried about seems in the movie .
saw two versions of this but this one was much better story and liked the actors in this one too .
bought all 3 seasons of scooby doo where are you ? awesome quality . a must have for anyone who grew up with the original .
a pleasant movie but nothing special . an ok way to spend a couple of hours . acting was fine but plot dragged .
a good sequel is hard to come by . however , this was better than the first ! you will not be disappointed with your purchase .
this is such a great and funny movie . one of my favorites . i love the actors and the story line
funny movie , great bonus is the twin pack and nice gift and family movie . ca n't go wrong with steve martin . the rest was a filler due to 12 words minimum .
this movie was a great way to start off the series . guy pierce has a good idea of how holmes should act and do .
just finished this one it is really great ca n't wait to start the next series , i know it will be great
i love this movie and i think that it is a good movie for the family including all ages . the whole family loves it .
this is a really good movie about life in the 60 's , fast cars , crazy young lovers , and fun to watch . i highly recommend it .
chris brown rocks the house with his singing and the family in this movie is truely great . the love laughter and tears are throughout this movie and it is a true joy to watch
i encourage every ncis fan to get this ; it 's the best season yet ! ncis is awesome ! buy it today please because you wo n't be disappointed at all !
this is not a show for the easily offended . it is , however , very funny . for everyone whose glory days are behind them .
love love love the actor choices ; otherwise i 'm not sure if the movie would have been as good . as the title states , enough said .
my 10 year loves this movie . funny for both kids and parents . recommended .
i have watched it several times . close enough to get some one thinking to maybe making a decision if they are being moved by the lord
another great christmas movie . just leaves you with that & # 34 ; feel good & # 34 ; feeling . i watch my christmas dvd 's all throughout the year .
after seeing seeing season 1 from the library , i knew i had to get the season series on dvd . the best show on tv .
instant classic . i saw this movie when i was younger in theaters and i still love every minute . jack and sally !
this movie brings back memories , but was not as good as i remember it . it has some very funny parts , some skin , but some lame parts . rent it if you can
not many disc due to short season , but nice set and good price ! ! !
yes not bad at all , i 'll need to consider watching it again to say if i really enjoyed it lol
i really enjoyed this movie despite what critics say . i like almost anything sci fi , except really low budget movies . tom hanks has a way to make you like him .
this is a great show . i truly enjoy it . i enjoy the story line as well as the acting . looking forward to season 3
i like morgan freeman and this shows him as a regular kind of guy and not some big time movie star . watch it and you will like or love it as well .
fringe is awesome and the second season does not disappoint ! it is a highly unique show that you should watch start to finish several times . enjoy !
ellen page is hilarious , well acted , scripted , and directed . overall great movie to have , never tire of watching it . that 's how good this movie is .
amazing film , a great movie to have when you and your girls want to stay in and watch a movie .
my 7 year old loves these dvds . great buy for us , i personally think they could be made better ( have more mario game graphics ) but who am i to say anyway ?
i love this series . it did n't end right to me . needed more seasons . i have watched the whole thing 3 times .
this was an inventive and incredible story that was written by a very creative mind . i loved it from start to finish .
i rented this for someone who was visiting me . i did n't think it was as good as the first one . maybe i should see it again ... i really did n't pay much attention to it .
wonderful storyline about what we as christians should be doing in this life . one young mind won to jesus grows to include many . do n't miss it .
this is a great movie the . the story is great the visuals . a must have for any movie buff who has kids .
dumb , silly , and poorly acted . i was aware of their acting rather than the story line all of the time .
this is a great movie but , as a blu-ray , could have received a better treatment concerning picture quality .
this movie is so wonderful . it 's funny and heartwarming . i 'm so surprised more people do n't know about it . it 's worth renting , you wo n't be disappointed .
i have watched this movie so many times . i never tire of it . samuel jackson does a great job in this movie .
it was a girls night out and we all wanted to go to the movies to see this movie , really liked the movie the ending was ok but would of preferred a different ending .
i loved the movie came in great shape , just what i wanted , great to watch with my husband while sharing some quite time
i ca n't believe they remade this movie . danny kaye is perfect in this role - no one can replace him . if you want to see real talent in action , check out this movie .
really great movie for the whole family to sit down and watch . a great story line with a great and happy ending .
and great price . i love the beach boys and am so happy to hear more magical music from them . brian wilson is my favorite artist .
i did enjoy this movie because it 's based on the bible but it was on fast forward . things happened so fast and the story just passed you by .
i thought this would be another film from this series . .. however it was so good and suspenseful it kept all of us on our toes
another great movie and this awesome too . if you like patrick in any of his movies you 'll love this one .
this movie is a classic , a must own , it puts ford in the top ten actors , of all time .
a wonderful true story about a young girl who had the courage to want to better her life . life is like a book - one page at a time .
so short , so sweet , so well executed for the 1950 's ... beautiful , amazing , insightful , simple ... well see for yourself is all i can say .
i really like the movie and so does my husband ... the chemistry between denzel & mark is great ... and their humor is too ...
i think this movie is great ! ! ! this movie has great action , and great visual effects ! ! ! this movie did indeed arrive on time ! ! !
i wish i had discovered this show when it was on the air it 's so well done . great story fantastic cast i look forward to watching this on amazon !
loved this movie ! my husband and i went to see it when it came to the theater in the 80 's . it has a good plot and ending .
crystal clear and brilliant colors . just what i hoped to get . a wonderful piece of work .
if you are familiar with the other underlying movies this film is a riot . i enjoyed the movie very much and will probably watch it several more times to catch everything i did not the first time around .
ok , it is animated , but the animation is great and there is a good story line . it is a good sci-fi movie and certainly worth watching a few times .
i usually love these two actors and the story lines they choose . this story was not what i expected . i will still watch these actors in the future .
i saw this movie ; years ago and i was happy amazon has it.i bought it on the instant video for my kindle . a really good movie i love the ocean
one of the best sitcoms ever ! great writing and acting . second only to i love lucy in my book . a classic !
i had seen this prior to purchase , enjoyed it enough to add to my collection , a good light hearted comedy .
i am an army wife . this movie was heartwarming and sweet . i loved that it included god and god 's plan for her life . a wonderful movie !
was very different . kind of dark tale , but also thrilling . had to know what was going to happen next . is there going to be another season ?
a clean show the whole family can watch . and the actors do a marvelous job ! the storylines are always good .
great show . if you like being on the edge of your seat , you will love this show . i recommend it . keeps you wanting more .
i completed the series of home improvement , this year , for christmas , for my son . he loves them , and watched them immediately .
this movie was n't all that entertaining , nor did i think the directing was very good . i recommend you pass on this one .
the bear is funny . but most of the funny stuff was in the commercials . not sure why it 's received so much hype as being one of the funniest movies ever - not even close .
i loved the show when it was on television and love being able to watch it whenever i want now .
this whole series is just wonderful ! this gift made a big hit for my grandson 's first birthday . i will look for other titles in the series .
if you want a cute love story , here it is ! you will want to watch it over again ! grab the popcorn and enjoy !
read by all , watched by many , you ca n't go wrong having this in your library . nothing else needs to be said , a classic ! !
move along , this movie did not keep me interested . it was strange for lack of better words . i do n't recommended this movie .
looking back at it from 2013 its pretty dated in approach . not something to look at as a classic , but as a time filler .
audrey is stunning in this story of a young girl who wants to work with the sick . i could easily re-watch it .
did not watch it all these years on tv . it is one of my favorite now . ca n't wait to watch the next one , so sometimes i watch them back to back to back
i guess i 'd heard so much about the movie before seeing it , that it did not live up to the hype . still a movie worth seeing !
very good movie . actually an excellent movie . true story and very well done . i would recommend this movie highly to anyone

this was a great tv show . i just hope all the seasons come out . i loved watching nick back in the 90 's , and more of those shows need to be on dvd .
there is n't much i can add to this wonderful movie . the bd update is crisp and clear as well as audio .
plenty of action , drama and even comedy mixed into one great movie . the acting was superb and no wonder it was given awards .
out of all the hulk movies i think my son likes this one the best and so do i thanks
i liked the movie and saw it several times over the years so i decided to add it to my dvd library .
love this season . this series was even better than i remembered . i think it is better than season one and would recommend it .
when this show was on tv i make a point to watch it all the time . this was great that now i can watch it anytime is great , but hope that i can find other seasons .
i love the riddick movies . non-stop action . you also get to see riddick evolve from the first movie pitch black .

this is great a collection of some off his great movies and this is andy hardy at his best all ways in and out of trouble
this movie should get six stars but you can only go as high as five . i love this movie due to its action style with a decent story .
have become an avid lover of this book series , have read the books and feel so far this is the best motion picture representation so far looking forward to the last two .
this movie is a total new movie from the original judd dredd . i really like this movie and should give it a honest viewing . in my option , it three times better than the original .
we love pirate movies and have a large collection this adds a new set of films that we enjoyed together

item shipped timely . item as described . great movie , one of the classics i would recommend to anyone . watched several times already
anything with jason statham is going to be action packed . this is a little less than his other films but you wo n't fall asleep either . more suspense and nice ending . definitely entertaining .
it is not a recent production but it is outstanding in all aspects ; singers , orchestra , production , this is the best there is , enjoy

well i like the fact that i can watch a movie that i want to watch when i want to watch it .

hilarious show with quick wit and fun characters - fast paced and entertaining : ) my favorite is jeremy 's interview ! fun
loved this purchase . bought it for a gift , it was a great price , not to mention it has a lot of my favorite christmas movies !
love season four as much as the first three seasons . we laughed through every episode . did n't want the dvd to end . if you want to laugh , get the dvd .
good but not great , but then one should not expect excellence from a film such as this . mainly for horror film collectors .
this was a great ending to a good series which started out as ( for me ) an animated series . too bad i had to give them to my son .
this is another movie that we do not remember being in the theaters , but we really enjoyed it . it had a great cast of characters .
did not want to walk away from the tv while watching this one . nicholas cage does a great job in this one .
the movie was as expected and has been viewed with my family plenty of times . extra features were great to watch .
this one is much better than the rated . i rented this twice , first unrated then by accident the rated . this one is much better .
great great great great great movie of all times besides king kong ! i collect all the classics its worth it
i have been a fan of the show for years . this is a must have for any fan of dark shadows , or a great movie to get you interested in the series .
i really like the show , the actors do a great job . i look forward to watching the whole series ! nice !
its a decent movie and watched it because i love anything with bruce willis in it . action type futuristic movie .
loved this movie . it 's funny and touching . i watch it every thanksgiving , but it 's great any time of the year .
this must be when he was just starting or something - doesnt fit his usual character not even b level
great movie . great acting . great plot . keeps you waiting for the great ending . two of the best actors . thanks sandra
the series is awesome , and we bought all the available series on dvd to get caught up . amazing acting . well worth the money .
this is like the ultimate classic movie even though most of us has seen it sooo many times , i still love it ! its a really great fantasy story that will never die !
loved it . it was romantic and funny . overall very good show . i would watch it again a few more times .
this movie had a interesting storyline . not sure what the storyline was but i did like . maybe i will see it later than now .
this was a great date night movie and especially good if you really enjoyed part one . good movie great price
this is one of her best video tapes . she is the best . i highly recommend it .
one of my favorite movies . about the best sort of story you could wish to get to know .
this is a very enjoyable movie about a father who goes on a college road trip with his daughter and he learns to let go eventually . it is very entertaining .
a classic movie with 2 classic actors and 2 classic actresses , they may have gotten older , but they are still able to make a great movie , some people only get better with age . : )
very funny movie story line was good teaches you how not to question your relationship when you have someone special be thankful
i have n't seen a movie that tyler perry made that i did n't like . the actors were wonderful , and the music beautiful .
odd humor you do not expect to see in a movie which gave me a laugh and some enjoyment to watch it
loved watching this show on syfy years ago so now i 'll be watching a marathon of it commercial free anytime . a great price and fast ship as usual . thanks
just got it . have only watched a few of the episodes . looks great and sounds great .
i liked the first season and not sure what happened but this season just seemed super corny , so i quit watching it .
still love randolph scott one of the old time favorite actors ~ yep need more like him in today 's movies
i love this series and i never really cared for zombie movies . i got the download so i could watch it on my ipad . ca n't wait for season 3 !
well acted , a good view , slightly unbelievable but two quality actors carry it of and the effects are excellent and well done
this movie is too long . i did n't like it . did n't find it that interesting .
my kids loved this movie ! the only complaint they had is that they felt it was n't long enough . worth watching !
lots of well known film stars putting in time for mad money . this is a better pick than watching standard television fare .
this is an excellent series and am so glad that i found it on line and reasonable and discs in good condition . thank you
i love this movie . ww2 , brad pitt , guns , & making history into something a little more satisfying . i recommend this movie .
wonderful movie , a real classic , laugh and cry at the same time . everyone should see this and not just once , over and over .
i throughly enjoyed this movie of hitchcock making psycho . it was entertaining and kept my attention throughout the movie . i would watch again .
i like sifi , and this had a clever premise , but just ended up being weird . it had potential , but did n't seem to actually go anywhere and left you hanging at the end .
harry potter has learned a lot over the years and it just keeps going . all these movies keep your attention .
this is just too cute for words . we have all the muppet movies and love all of them . but this is my absolute favorite . highly recommend .
these were really great western movies to watch . we loved each of them and we will watch them again . they do not have the violence that a great many movies have today .
i loved seasons one and two and this one was no different . phil is one of my favorite television characters so i always enjoy the episodes where he plays a big part .
this was purchased as a gift and was very much appreciated . it was something desired and he was very happy to get . it was just as advertised and shipped as stated .
i saw some previews of this show and bought it out of curiosity . it is a great action series with great actors . will leave you wanting more
i love this movie . it 's cute and blue and i love the nyc scenery ... . : ) . it 's a good hd purchase too since its a new movie and details are plenty .
every average and hardcore horror fan should have this in their movie collection . not as scary as most people say , but lots of gore and entertainment with a very original story .
my husband and i both enjoyed this movie ! ! the dvd was in great condition ! ! this is a great addition to our collection !
beautiful sets , a sweet story and casting is perfect . i wish this was still on the air . i miss it .
another great family move that can be for anytime of year , not just christmas . i recommend this move to everyone .
it was a great movie , there was n't really anything i did n't like about it.i really enjoyed this film ... very well done .
another great action film in the mission impossible series . a must have for an action movie or cruise fan . good buy
two of the greatest movies from the 1950 's , both are great stories and great visual effects for their day yeah
my daughter & i love this movie and the people in this movie make this movie one of the best ! !
history movies are my favourite . this is a good movie , i really enjoy it ! cate blanchett 's acting is amazing as always . great cast , picture and costumes ! ! !
this is a true classic with don knotts . i have been looking for those classics from growing up to add to my collection . found this and could not resist .
i loved the series when it was on television and am enjoying it just as much as when i saw it the first time . free tv series episodes just adds a wonderful bonus to my amazon prime membership !
two good actors give a very good performance that is very funny and enjoyable to watch . the cast also includes many other very good actors that combine to make a very good movie !
one of my all time favorites . good acting , lots of action and even a chick could watch it ( is that wrong ? ? ) !
a wonderful & # 34 ; well it could have been like that & # 34 ; one . the flavor of the times was so well done . i would recommend this to everyone .
great fast paced movie that keeps you wondering . i really loved this story line and intrigue . i recommend this to friends .
the bluray release of this sci-fi classic is incredible . far superior to dvd or vhs versions of this film . bluray is cool .
my daughter has always love these movies even as a child . she was glad that i found this it was a great buy .
love to watch . funny movie to enjoy while doing what the title states . dont expect oscar material - just a lot of laughs
this is a must have for the any fan of the series . it 's very entertaining and full of action packed episodes . i highly recommend it for any age !
heart still has it and both sisters could still sing in 2001 ( when made ) if your a heart fan get it
this movie is almost exactly the same as the first with some subtle differences it is funny though
the quality of the hd was good , the movie was ok , kinda funny my 5 year old niece had no interest so i guess now we do n't need to buy it : )
i have watched this plenty of times but love it . i love watching christian and inspirational movies and am stocking up on them . this is a must see for a family whether you know god or not .
i sent it to my 4 year old granddaughter and she wants to watch it everyday ! ! wow ! ! my daughter has really enjoyed it all over again ! !
it 's great to be able to get videos of old shows i grew up with . with so little to watch on tv now nice to be able to have these available .
i liked this movie , although its somewhat not your average romance film . it 's set in an atmosphere that is somewhat depressing , however , there is a good story line .
this is an all time classic movie . peter sellers should have gotten an oscar for his work in this highly creative and original film
this is one of our favorite movies . love it . thanks for making it available for us to purchase at this time .
this a great part of the old series and i really like it , some series are better with the old version and not the new ... .
my five year old seemed to watch it for 30 minutes and then did not care to finish it . i only lasted 10 minutes .
this movie is about a young woman trying to find her way to the right path . she finds out that all you have to do is listen your heart
it 's fine . charlize theron did a great job , and she definitely carried the movie in my opinion . i am not sure if i will watch the sequel .
i really enjoyed this show . i had never seen it so i took a chance because of the great actors . i was not disappointed !
this is a really good movie and i would highly recommend it to anyone who loves this genre . too funny and great plot .
the ending was awesome . little awkward using a child but it was good . some parts dragged on but over all i thought it was a great movie ! ! ! ! !
this in my opinion is one of the best films on jesus christ that was ever made . it is moving and the film i have seen .
these are all fairly light hearted superhero cartoons . sure they look like they were made in the 60 's , but their is a timeless quality about them . yes , it 's a good thing .
this really is a fun film , costuming is brilliant and the performances are delightful ! great twist at the end of the film !
i never get tired of watching this movie -- and the soundtrack literally rocks ! wahlberg , as always , is incredible in this movie .
one of the best movies ever made . i do n't care about special features so i could n't tell you about those . just needed a new copy .
this movie was such a beautiful story . watch it all the time & love it . pixar always makes wonderful movies & this is one of my favorites .
it is a fun movie to watch . makes you think of your own high school days . love melissa joan hart !
my daughter likes this movie a lot . it is sort of a sad movie but does have a good moral theme .
this is a wholesome , enjoyable movie to watch . i could watch this movie over and over , and as a matter of fact , i will .
i loved brad pitt and edward norton is a freak ! this movie is definitely a mind trip . you have to see it to believe it .
i 'm sure i 'm going to like it , i just have n't had a chance to watch it . i like the musical on tv and that 's why i bought my own cd .
this movie was ok. it was not anything too special . it was worth the watch , but not one i would want to watch over and over .
this movie , although this version is the original is filled excitement and humor , very relaxing to look at , highly recommended .
i saw this recently on pbs and really enjoyed it . i did not have high expectations but it was well done and kept my interest . i hope there will be more of these .
it was just really nice to see a well developed plot , great acting and a story that kept my interest throughout .
just love the lord of the rings . however left hanging until the next hobbit movie .
i had n't seen these in so long - it was great to re-watch them all at once . blu-ray is such great quality and got them super fast in the mail .
i happen to like the actors and tommy lee jones was great as the typical older man . not meryl streep 's finest performance . not a riveting movie but cute and kind of funny in spots .
it was too slow , and boring . i lost interest and started playing games on the computer . but you might like it .
i really like the plot and the characters of the movie . lots of good action and some character development . worth the cost of the rental in my opinion
the special effects are phenomenal . brought together the first series very well . liked this one better then the first movie
this movie is so humorous , we love it ! it is fun and clean for the whole family , definitely one of our favorites .
this was a present for a family member . i know that columbo was very big in its day . i am sure they will enjoy it . thank you .
great gift . my sister loves this movie with burt , says it is one of her favorites .
if you are a star trek buff this is must own along with the rest of the movies to this series .
we must have watched this movie 10 times . i love the twists of events at the end ! ! ! this is definitely a movie to see if you have not seen it already .
so good - when it 's over i wish there were more ! you ca n't help but get addicted to true blood !
if you love fantasy movies , you have to watch this , but be prepared for some bad acting ... the plot is great and so are the sets .
its a great beginning to a great show . i also bought spencer 's mountain . if you enjoyed & # 34 ; the waltons & # 34 ; , you need to see both of these
the first season is great and its wonderful to see each episode uncut instead of seeing them on tv cut for commercials . waiting for season 2 .
excellent product discs had no problems and played perfectly love this show and cant wait to order more hope they got more
i wish i could get more seasons . i love dr. g and wish i could do her job ! she is awesome !
if you like vampires and werewolf you will love this movie . love the whole series . plan on buying the rest of them .
i think the world of clint eastwood but i don ` t care to much of his move
i enjoy everything about the american indian . it is so sad but something i believe everyone should be aware of !
this movie is a must see for all dog lovers . the relationship between man and dog is so heart warming !
i liked it , pretty decent but not as good as some of the more & # 34 ; cult classic & # 34 ; zombie flicks like dawn of the dead , etc .
this movie was different and was very interesting from start to finish . think i 'll watch it again real real soon .
what can you say about roseanne . either you love her or you hate her ! ! ! the dvd was great . very pleased with transaction and delivery time .
i have n't seen all of the bond movies , but most of them , including the early ones . this is the best one in my opinion .
i thought it could have had the same outcome in 20 minutes as it did in almost two hours just okay in my book .
kind of a turning of age movie . it was entertaining but had bad language . not something everyone would want to see
it was well acted and well written . i took away one star because the main character did n't survive . that sucked , but the rest was really good .
what can i say when you have robert downey jr as the star of a movie ! love this move and have watched it many times !
great movie for the whole family . kids love the `` snow man '' and the story is heartwarming
it 's loud , sure , but i really liked this one the best , having seen every one of the entire collection as they were released .
i love the fact that i wake up and my episode is ready for download . we are on the go and do n't have dvr so the ipad works great and is always with me .
just watch it dont pay attention to all the reviews its a good movie fast paced good music and interesting .
wasnt sure what to expect , but the movie turned out to be a great addition to our war movie collection
it was like & # 34 ; aliens & # 34 ; at first before they got on this ship ! if you think about it , i am right !
this drama has not gotten as much attention as other british productions , but i think it is one of the best . everything you expect : beautiful costumes and locations , great actors , intriguing story .
i believe this version is the original . for me , no other version ( and there have been many ) comes close to this version .
liked the story and the ending , it was a bit slow for me and a soap opera flavor , which is not my thing and why i gave it four stars .
possibly the best movie to watch on an ipad while sitting in a plane ever made . is die hard with giant robots .
not a bad start but i feel short of liking this movie . almost like a copy of some other movie .
not what i expected , very well done . it is a must see , expected a romance and got a family drama and war flick all in one .
if you are into this kind of movie you will love it ! it really gets to the heart of what these people went through . i would highly recommend this one .
what is not to like about burn notice ? it has been around all of this time for a good reason .
i was satisfied with the product and the time it took to get to me . : )
these are classic comedies and i bought the blu-ray versions to add to my collection . walter matthau and jack lemmon were greats .
it adds and follows the movies extremely well . the acting is superb and i will hate to see it end !
i remember seeing this some time ago and i thought this was a crazy movie but it had a great plot and a even greater twist ! !
if you love british productions or if you love history or if you just love watching a family drama without having to watch sex and violence , you 'll love downton abbey
great movie and action keeps you on the edge of your seat on what will happen next in this movie
it was far to much like a sad and sappy soap opera . i just could not get into the show .
ordered this to add to private collection after enjoying it so much on tv . wonderful story lines and extremely entertaining .
this is one of my favorites when it comes to clint eastwood and westerns in general . love it and watch it at least once a year or so .
this is a great movie to entertain the younger crowd as well as the generation that grew up in the 90 's and watched these movies , a good purchase !
i would watch this show over in reruns and always miss the ending ... now i own all the seasons and can watch them whenever i want ...
this is what was expected of this kind of movie . i hate to use the word typical .
i do n't like cruise but this movie was just good . suspenseful and action packed .
this movie holds up really well for as old as it is . it is always it is fun to watch old scifi movies set in the future .
good flick not a bad movie at all . depp kills it like always , he takes the character and makes it his .
i really love this movie , so very good i ca n't believe that i have never seen it on tv . it had some very good effects for when it was made .
i really love the midsomer murders series and am looking forward to being able to collect the entire series . can hardly wait !
blu-ray is the way to go ! ! ! ! i love ed norton and colin farrell and they did n't disappoint ! ! ! ! ! ! thank you ! ! ! ! !
good movie but already knew that before i watched it . i had seen it years ago but , forgot the plot so watched it again .
i did n't have high hopes for it , but i actually really liked it . certainly had my full attention . i recommend it ! !
this was a very interesting side story . it was mild compared to other marvel animated movies . not over the top , but still a great movie .
i love veggie tale movies . this is one i was replacing from my purchased copy in vhs format . it 's god 's word made simple ! thank you big idea !
classic comedy . great writers . will keep you laughing from beginning to end . characters are well developed . story lines for episodes are humorous and interesting .
exceptionally entertaining and heart-warming . . .the casting is excellent , the plot is good , and there is a delightful musical theme . hilarious at times .
get all of the movies in 3d ! i do n't usually watch bonus discs , so the fact they are n't in here does n't matter to me . i am such a fan of these movies !
i bought this for my sister and her family who just moved to canada . i forgot how much this movie sucked .
i enjoyed these movies and they were great to watch after a long day of work . i am not the greatest fan of charlie sheen , but these are good to watch .
gary cooper and grace kelly and a tense drama . what 's more to like ? this is a just plain excellent movie ! ! !
i have never even seen the whole blade trilogy and watched it and loved it and wesley snipes really played the part extremely well .
one of the classics ! ! ! seen it more than once ... love to watch it when its cold out ... .great actors ... great story line ... .
a fun movie for an evening in . doris day and rod taylor are good together .
our family enjoyed this movie . a new twist on an old story with lots of laughs !
i saw this on the big screen when it was released over 20 years ago . it 's just a funny , easy movie to view .
i love watching the mission impossible trilogy series and the old tv show . theres nothing like watching something you grew up with .
i bought this for my brother and he loved it . thanks so much for having it.. great gift for the family .
my mom was sooooo excited to get this movie . so was i cause that just means she has it and does n't have to watch at my house anymore !
great series , fun to watch , nothing too serious , enjoyed watching the entire series but you can tell it was getting worn out by the 5th season ...
these brought back memories of when i first started watching the show . i always loved getting to know these characters .
i did not find the story line believable . it was supposed to be a comedy , but it did not make me laugh . i did not enjoy it at all .
loved the anime but the case was cracked other than the case being cracked overall good anime i loved it
very good movie . it is intense with some very extreme fighting scenes . it also does a great job showing the human side of war on both sides .
i enjoyed this movie with action and no profanity or nudity . i wish hollywood would understand that we do not need blood , guts , profanity or nudity to be entertained and wholesome family movies do sell .
my husband and i are murdoch fans and could n't wait to get this . got it almost immediately in the mail .
one of my all time favorite movies . i wish it would go on forever . good product and good service . thanks
the movie is so cute and a lot of people can relate . i would highly recommend the purchase .
i really liked the comics when they were on the stands . the movie stays true to the original story . you have have a little trouble with the plot if you don 'd know the story .
this movie was very different from any movie i have ever seen i hope they come out with sequel to this movie .
same humor , wonderful characters and a great storyline . loved that we found out how the team came about . worth watching just for the special effects .
i have these dvds because they are safe for my young grandsons to watch . newer cartoons are not nearly as good .
when i first saw this movie , i was pleasantly surprised . i found this to be a great movie for old and young alike .
i really enjoyed this movie ... it kept me riveted from the opening scene on . really intense with a great ending !
too funny ! great romantic comedy , fun to watch on date night ! ! i have seen several times , and always get a laugh ! !
good parts to the movie , funny here and there but way too long . some parts of the movie was ridiculous and i think unnecessary .
i love clark gable and this movie is very good . i bought this for my mom and she watches it all the time . great buy .
i really enjoyed this movie , it was a different type of movie , and the features in the menu were great to watch also . i 'm glad to include this movie in my video library .
well done movie . not exactly what i expected . showed a side of marilyn i believe few people knew . the actors were great
it 's one of those movies you can watch over and over . jodie foster at her best . highly recommend this movie .
really a fine movie and story . a real lost gem that is enjoyable to watch time and time again . burt lancaster gives a terrific performance .
total waste of time and money . movie was boring and really not worth the time or effort to even order
what is not to like ? it 's entertaining , it 's really good , the story lines are fresh and it has simon baker in it ! that 's a win , win !
great movie , the picture and color quality is excellent in blu-ray . the dvd is just as great as it was in the movies .
an old fashioned series that i used to watch on tv as a child . it brought back some pleasant memories . well done .
horrible , boring nonsense ! nothing more to say - just wasted 2 hours ( actually i fell asleep , so it was n't a complete waste ) . do n't waste money or time on this stinker !
this was good i loved the woman of substance much better , but hold the dream was good , the story continues !
one of my favorite john wayne movies . great price and lots of entertainment here . love any movie with john wayne .
i loved the series and loved this movie particularly . this is one book that you need to read the books first since much of the action reflects the mental nature of the hunger game .
i never have seen a more funny movie than this one . it has always been one of my favorites . i am so glad i was able to purchase it from you all .
it 's a movie to watch on a day when you have nothing else to do , because it was very predictable .
this movie is great , the cast have a great chemistry together ! owen wilson , vince vaughn , bradley cooper and christopher walken together make for one very funny combination .
good acting , direction , plot , and storyline . i have seen this move more than once in the past and enjoyed watching it again .
you ca n't go wrong with lewis black , his stand up is laugh out loud funny ! [ ... ]
this was a christmas present for my daughter , she loves this movie so much . now she wants the new one
i have always loved both of these movies . i can still remember going to the movies to see them on the big screen . the sound and digital quality are great !
i got this for somebody who has been looking for it , they enjoyed it , it was in good condition and for a good price , thank you .
just as good , if not better than the first movie . i ca n't tell why without giving away the plot , but it will definately surprise you .
the delivery was in perfect time ! i love the first and the second part of this trilogy and this part is just fantastic ! the special effects on this movie are so awesome ! !
a good cast of characters in a surprisingly engaging thriller . lots of twists and turns , so it requires your full attention . i liked it .
we love watching these movies at home . they never get old and i ca n't wait to watch them over and over again .
i watch one of the episodes every night before i go to bed . there 's nothing like a good laugh to end your day !
i had vhs tape before . i watched in dvd . it was excellent movie as i remember .
this movie is a complete disaster . it fails in every way . save your time and money do n't purchase this film .
it desire five star and love it can not wait to see next season and it worth buying it rule
one of those films you will watch time and time again ( if you like the cast of course ) you will love this !
i was very happy with this video . i was pleased with the service i received .
i saw this on tv and my heart just broke . very emotional but very good . i would recommend this to everyone . very prompt delivery .
wow , really disappointed in the picture quality of the blu ray . really grainy . great show , but not worth the price of a blu ray . buy the dvd .
very low grade movie . i ca n't believe they think anyone would enjoy this at all . do n't waste your valuable time .
one my most favorite movies of the 1980 's i highly recomend watching this : ) this is also a good family movie too
good follow-up to & # 34 ; the mummy ' & # 34 ; if you like funny and scary adventure .
this service is fast and simple no complaints no problems only joy and happiness . i would recommend this service to all and everyone .

nothing about this movie is great . not sure why , just did n't feel anything . the acting is pretty blah , the story line is blah . do n't bother
really lame movie , hard to sit through because of the poor filming and acting . was this movie made for 100 bucks ? it sure looks like it .

i have to admit blu ray does make a difference ! a classic sci-fi movie and one of the best sequels ever . well worth it !
i liked this series better when it was called , columbo , and starred peter falk .
for all the previous reviewers who gave this film a 4 or 5 star , this review is just to say that i am with you .

i have n't seen this since i was a child . loved watching it again . glad older movies are available to watch .
this movie is a classic . i just love john wayne . he is one of my all time favorite actors . the movie played great also .
thought this was the life of pi . could not watch more than 15 minutes . thought it was depressing and sad not what you want to watch on a weekend evening .
i kept waiting for the movie to make some kind of sense . i 'm guessing it just was n't my kind of movie . the previews got my attention , the movie dropped it .
a fun movie with a great story line . bought it for the 3d and was very happy with how it looked on the tv .
this this one of the top hitchcock shows made , love the suspense but the ending could have been better , what a classic .

worth watching ! the series is a complete story , so this is one aspect of the journey !
it was a very excellent product , i like this movie , to everyone who likes this kind of movie , very good product .
there was only one quick shot of skin , the rest could be fast forward through . i gave the movie away .
the plot of the movie is really good it keeps you glued to the screen .
it is just as good the 5th time as it was the 1st . i love movies that are well scripted and entertaining .
the people were average looking and so was the scenery -- so no escape from realism . kids liked it . too slow and boring for me .
awesome about the military school . it is sad you will cry but it is worth crying for . please buy this amazing story .

the cast , the plot and the soundtrack are all great ! ! ! i can watch over and over again
this movie starts off very slow , but i really enjoyed the movie . i do wish it had a better ending that 's why i only gave it 4 stars . i would watch it again .
this is one of the greatest movies ever made and i think everyone should watch it . it has terrific lessons that we all should learn .
has been so long since i 've seen this , i could n't remember it . what a lovely lovely movie . hits the right note all through .
the 2nd one just lacked interest in what the characters had to do in the movie . i was hoping for more and i got the typical sequel movie .
nicely done period piece . i have n't watched all the episodes yet . i do love watching these historically accurate ( looking ) shows .
whats not to love about this movie ! this is my all time favorite movie and its on blue ray ! this makes me very happy ! ! !
this is one of the funniest movies i have seen in a long time . would recommend to any friends or family members .
love this tv show , so sad that it was canceled after only 3 seasons , i would have watched it for at least 2 more !
maggie smith is such an outstanding actress , both past and present . i would suggest to anyone who enjoys quality acting to her films .
i bought this for my mom . she says it is kind of just a repeat of the other cutting edge videos but being & # 34 ; part two & # 34 ; it is n't that bad .
this was a very light and funny movie . i enjoyed it and even bought part 2. i enjoyed it from begining to end . welcome to the bear community .
clearly worth the academy awards it received . one of the greatest movies of human struggle ever made . a must buy .
this movie was weak . the actors were too fake . do n't waste your money .
if you 're a fan of the 50 's sci-fi genre , these are four of the best .
this movie is great 80s cheese . the movie has great atmosphere and the music fits perfectly . but why is there no widescreen ? ? this movie has been edited to fit your tv .
entertaining , and believable plot . characters were realistic and i enjoyed seeing them play their parts well . would recommend it for an evening 's fun activity .
this movie caused me to wonder if there might be some truth to the story ... ? excellent performances , graphics , and cast .
i had seen this movie at the theater already , but i loved the plot but had to watch it with some friends who have not seen it before and they loved it as well
i found this movie to be very watchable , good action with a little bit of humor , not bad for a foreign film .
i liked this movie . i was not a fan of the tv show , but this was funny and entertaining . i have had a small problem with streaming but it seems to be with roku
kinda of a chick flick but it was a funny movie and i really enjoyed watching it with the wife and kids .
ok acting but good action scenes ; worth a watch for a home rental . keep in mind these are not real actors .
now i have all 4 movies ! i love scary movies . especially the scream series ! i grew up when they came out .
just a great movie all around . warm , loving , inspirational , and not sappy at all . well worth the money and time . will watch it every year .
great quality . the story line is good . forces you to watch part 3. the voices seem the same . the characters stories are pretty good .
possibly the best season of this show , every season i think of getting showtime just to be able to watch the next one faster .
have the whole collection of john wayne now . watch them over and over all the time . a man to look up to .
this is a great hip workout , but it 's longer then i have time for . nothing wrong with the workout , though . it 's fun !
night court season 3 was just as funny as seasons 1 & 2. i would definitely recommend this dvd set to anyone who enjoyed night court in the 80s .
this is the first season of the show . it is very funny . there are many jokes and no commercials . many funny episodes to enjoy .
i really enjoy watching these movies and how the storyline and characters develop . would recommend them to anyone who enjoys period films .
stupid quick fun . great cast and some edgy humor that keeps me coming back for more . i really enjoy the show .
i am very pleased with my purchase . it was sent very quickly and in great condition . the movie was very colorful and the birds were great .
my wife loved it and i just followed along . it was a good movie i guess . my wife read the book first and liked it even more so i guess it was good
this was a great sifi series from the 70 's . i would definitely recommend it to sifi lovers .
this is one of the best gay love movies made . you wo n't be dissapointed .
what can you say about this movie , except that it is a classic ! everyone should watch this movie at least once . meryl streep is awesome , as usual . i recommend it .
purchased this as a gift for my husband . he is a big twilight zone fan . he has watched the shows several times .
i can always count on ben affleck to produce an awesome movie . everything was performed to a 10 , even the musical score .
these collections are great for kids . i am so glad they have these available on dvd . we own the rest of the volumes
i love this movie when i seen it in the theaters so of course i had to buy it when it came out ! ! ! !

i love this show . they do n't make shows like this anymore . great family fun . received them fast too . great service .
mrs. miracle is an excellent movie and i watch this over and over and over . i can just about quote the script but i do n't care - i love it .
picture quality is very good . movie in same genre as `` last man on earth '' vincent price and `` i am legend '' will smith .
pretty funny ! nothing tops the first one but it 's funnier than hangover 2. purchased it right after i watched it .
nothing original here , van damme has had better movies . not realistic , but did n't expect that . problem was that even the action was a little dull .
fun , human , and believable ride through the relationship between the hitchcock couple . makes me interested in learning more about the master of suspense .
enjoyed the movie . we saw it just before we saw red 2 and would tell everyone that it was full of action and so funny
love to watch these kind of movies because i can reflect back on history . i love charlton heston in just about everything i have seen him play in .
i 'm glad that this was released on bluray . the visuals and audio are top notch . this will always be a classic movie .
movie was different than expected - it was n't great and it was n't horrible so rated it okay ! bill murray was in more serious role and that was odd for me .
so compelling , intriguing , with good actors . i have fell in love with british series and this is my favorite . bring more please
as someone who has watched the original film over and over i found this to be a nice remake which i really enjoyed . nice action movie .

it 's one of those situations one hopes never happens . the acting is good and the story line is quite riveting .
i actually purchased this for my oldest son to complete his twilight saga collection . he loves it . guess it 's great for anyone that is into this movie series .
i bought this for someone else and i may borrow it and watch it sometime .
if blues music is your thing then you will love this movie . the story line is a bit bizarre but the music is outstanding . a must see for blues lovers .
the story is good the acting is good the knowledge of the system seems in line with what i know it to be the emotions are true . the scenery is beautiful along with the clothing
dr. quinn , medicine woman was one of the best series ever on modern television . great family viewing . i highly recommend it .

even though a 70s movie it was interesting and also erotic ... .. had obviously sexual content not for under 17 ages
i am a gary cooper fan , enjoy all his movies as i see them , but do not think this is one of his better movies .
i think this is the first jennifer lopez movie that i actually liked . plenty of action and the ending will have you sitting on the edge of your seat . just a great movie .
one of the best movies of all time ! very good movie . the actresses in this movie were superb ! the best .
all of these are the greatest . can not wait for the 7th one to come out . so sad about paul walker .
one of the best series on tv maybe of all time excellent store and i 'm finding out more truth than fiction

very fun movie it 's great to watch with the whole family and it will have everyone rolling with laughter i love this movie !
still funny after all these years . the quality of the bluray makes the movie look like it was filmed 10 years ago instead of 20
we really enjoyed this movie and i was surprised . i just did n't think we would like as well as the first but it was superb . i ca n't wait to see more of these .
it 's difficult to find movies that are entertaining and appropriate for families , but this one fits the bill . enjoyed it with my grandson
i could n't watch the whole thing . bad acting and special effects . i wish i had n't wasted the money on this thing .
kept my attention and was about what i expected . how do you go wrong with cusack and cage . i enjoyed it .
good movie if you like the older classics - good acting - not on the top of the list but worth buying if the price is right .
this movie is very well done and is surely worth the price and i 'm glad to have it in my collection .
it is a great movie . mirren was fantastic . also , renting it off amazon was wonderful . we were visiting my mother and we were able to really enjoy it with her through amazon
if you are a fan of are you being served the bbc television series , then you 'll enjoy this movie ! it 's wonderful british humor and characters really are great !
really good movie great action definitely great remake . well done action and lots of it . ca n't wait for the next one
although well drawn and filmed this movie goes nowhere without much reason . thin characters , plot forgotten , and ending that simply loses . anyone want my copy ? free !
i loved this movie . sad in the beginning but it does a fine job of showing how family members can move passed the tragedy , and honor the person 's life .
this the best version of the musical and the blue ray brings out the great story and original production in its full sound and color . it is worth getting .
the story of tina turner is heartwarming . the story line was riveting and the music phenomenal . loved every minute of it .
i loved this when it first came out and now my 5 year old grand daughter and i are enjoying it again !
this a great horror movie with a twist . it is better than what the reviews have given it . i would recommend this movie .
the audio is better than the video in this stupid and dumb movie . i 'm glad i will be returning it .
pretty good movie . the boys in the movie are great and the theme of innocence and trust takes you back to another time .
a movie that you could watch over and over again . the animation is awesome and the story lots of fun . a great movie for young and old .
i have been a stargate fan since the beginning . i have seen the movie a couple of times and i still enjoy it . rent , buy , enjoy ... .
mediocre at best story line was bad ; dry and predictable only action scenes drew interest . they used one liners from previous movies .
while watching this collection i laughed and laughed . she is one of the best comedians that i never tire of watching .
excellence suspense , from non other than daniel craig himself . and excellent story , with may plot holes . some come together during part of the movie , but the ending will shock you
just a nice movie to watch again after so many years of all the stallone classics ( rocky 's , rambo 's , etc . ) henry winkler and perry king are also in this one !
i love this show . it 's so funny and realistic . well , for a cartoon anyway . i recommend that any fan buy this complete series . you wo n't be disappointed . : - )
great movie . love old movies and this one is up there in favorites . cagney and fonda deliver a good movie . a must have if you have an oldies collection .
this movie is a cult classic for its raunchy small town humor ! i appreciate the typical characters that are n't played so typically . definitely worth the buy !
i liked the characters in this movie and the play between the various characters . very realistic characters and situations , too .
i remember seeing this movie after it first came out . it is still a good plot , but for me the movie has n't held up with time . seems outdated .
excellent movie , the british knew how to do it right . i love the coen brothers , but their remake of this comedy was lame , lame , lame !
great set was cheaper for all 3 , compared to the single movie in the local store . like how they were each on their own dvd
story was n't that great but action scenes were decent . would recommend this only if you love comic adaptations and or like the wolverine comic character .
a great show and i could n't believe the price , it was stupid not to buy it so i got my copy and a great deal .
great action adventure burton and eastwood at there best good story with a fast pace no dull bits , loads of shoot them up , blow them up , good stuff .
his movie is one of my favorites . ben affleck was terrific and i can see why it was an academy award winner .
i have bought everything by tyler , plays and movies . this one is so funny . add this to your library and you wo n't be sorry . you can relate to the characters very easily .
this movie would easily fall into my top twenty favorite films . it has romance , comedy , and tragedy rolled up into one . it has subtitles , but it is well worth the watch .
funny and kinda sexy . purchased it cause it fits the classic genre of comedy / horror movies . costume and makeup is good .
could n't even make it through it , did fast forward a little to see if it got any better , it did not !
the first movie was the best and the second was a repeat of the first . not much originality , but still full of action .
i wanted to purchase the movie , not just rent it . funny , cute , silly , and enjoyable are just a few words to describe it . kid safe . recommended .
has to be the best ever dvds of all time . very funny couple who are the best at acting . amazing .
with this i have one more volume to go and i have the whole series . and that 's all i want , to have the entire season of what i grew up with . volume 2 next .
got my dvd very quick , and the dvd works great . my grandkids are very happy with this dvd . thank you .
this is a must have for anyone who is new to blu ray . the lord of the rings in blu ray , especially with great surround system is awesome . let me say it again awesome .
this is one of my favorite cartoons . i was very pleased to find it and receive it in a very timely manner and in such good condition . i am very pleased with this order .
the standard disc special edition is just as good as the hd version of this movie .
i was disappointed in this movie . the cast was great but the story was slow and not to my taste .
my children love watching the old horror movies ( not really that scary so great for kids ) . they love collecting these old movies .
this was my coming out flick on first date ! it was nice seeing it decades later ! great print and great extras !
how can you not like the best news team around ? and in hd their delivery is even better ! this is a must have in anyone 's home video collection : - )
loved this movie . definitely worth a viewing . fight scenes were fun to watch and she still looks good ! ! ! i think you need to rent this . you will smile and feel happy .
i watched it , package was shipped excellent and i love the show . so it was worth the price to me , everyone should have a copy .
i love this mini series . i ca n't find the 2nd or 3rd movie . if anyone knows where i can buy it , please let me know .
this is a classic movie with great acting and with great legendary actors i would recommend that those who want to experience the christian faith need to get this movie .
i love super hero movies , especially ones with robert downey jr. in them . did you know he can sing ? the hulk is pretty good too .
eddie murphy is just genius in this buddy cop movie . if you are only familiar with the shrek version of eddie murphy , then this is worth the watch .
this show was the best show i ever saw . i still watch it every chance i get . i plan to buy the dvd as well .
movie is very intelligent . i enjoyed it a lot . ending was depressing , but most good movies are . it 's a keeper .
this movie was better than expected as i thought it was going a different direction based on the trailers i 've seen . if you are into thoughtful sci-fi , then you might enjoy this one .
good movie but i still do n't get what the point of it was . kind of strange if you ask me .
this movie has turned my 4 year old daughter into a cinderella freak ! my older sons ' roll their eyes at the thought of watching it but she loves cinderella !
i love the episodes and you will also . it makes you want to buy all the seasons like i did .
a good fun movie that anyone could watch a few times . some movies you see once and that is it , this one you can watch once in a while and still like it .
exciting heart warming funny adventurous movie my kids watch it i think like a million times over lol . they just love these little guys .
all of the shows are interesting to watch , but u can only watch them so any times , but they are good .
i am a tom cruise fan and he again did not fail to impress me . he is charming , never give up agent .
it 's definitely much funnier than the american version . i could watch it over and over .
my husband does n't like movies or most regular sitcoms ... .but , this is one program we can sit down and enjoy together in the evenings when we want .
great to see hepburn & tracy ` s chemistry on screen . they are so cute together in this movie as it was in the beginning of their off screen relationship .
with the 7th season of roseanne , there 's only 2 more seasons left to be release ! ! & hope they do so as fast as this show ' been release on dvd ! !
i bought this movie as a gift to a friend . i have not seen the movie . i repeat , i bought this movie as a gift to a friend . i have not seen the movie .
this was a gift he loves this movie and did n't own it . i 'm so glad i was able to find it for a good price on here . it was worth the money .
product was exactly how it was described , arrived very quickly and in good condition . would definitely recommend this product to someone . love this show , favorite show
i like a good western or comedy and some drama , but i find it is so easy shopping at home and having the movie when i want to watch it . i 'm very pleased .
really enjoyed the story . great dvd , it came in very good condition . would highly recommend this . good price for a great story .
its somewhat outdated and so are the songs . i guess i was bringing back some of those days .
i like bruce , so it was a interesting concept , good and action packed . a must see in the bruce collection of movies
these are the best movies for children . the movies teach lessons and morals to our children and for this i am thankful .
several newer buddy movies have been made but none can replace the original bill and ted . they are the best .
maybe i had great expectations of this movie but , i have to say , i really did n't enjoy it as much as the previous ones .
this movie delivers a heart warming story and shows how great little children can be and how people can change based upon their life experiences .
i have never seen this program when it was on . but it was out there with the graphics and the story line of what if .
these was a sweet love story . i 'm a huge basketball lover , so i got to see that along with a cute story line and was very happy at the end of the movie .
this movie was fantastic to watch . i was shocked that i would like it but i enjoyed it so much i watched it twice .
for all that is said about this movie it is really enjoyable for me to watch and i like the message it gives .
best movie , kids love it , wholesome for my 2 year old . funny for me and the wife .
this movie is a classic . i ca n't say which i like better , this one or the new one . they are both awesome movies . john wayne is one of my all time favorite actors .
i enjoy seeing an old show that had good acting and scripts to keep one 's interest . i remember watching it with my parents .
was a great movie i love all the madea movies , worth watching , me and my family could not stop laughing
i 've always been skeptical of remakes and rarely seen one that does justice to the source material , but i am legend is not just a remake , it sets the bar .
very nicely crafted musical . excellent acting and singing . the music was great . i could watch this musical many more times .
good movie that has english subtitles but i could n't find this information anywhere on the page . it would be nice to know this before i rent a movie .
this is one of the greatest comedies of british t.v . dawn french is wonderful . a delightful show . full of great actors and great and funny writing ! !
i bought this movie because i like the spiderman movies . it turned out to be good . all spiderman movies are good .
started this series just to see what it was about , and loved it . i wish they would have done more seasons . i would encourage anyone to check it out . most excellent .
excellent action film . great ending story to this version of the batman trilogy . great gift if given with the first two movies in blue ray hd .
this is one of many and it is hands down the best tv series that was ever on public tv channels
do n't let the fact that it 's subtitled stop you from getting this movie . there 's good action all around and great cinematography . if you like gangster films you should definitely give this a try .
the film to me was a waste of time ! it did not seem worth the time to watch nor worth the money .
i liked this movie and had to get it for myself . it is an adventure and a half . it is very funny . probably the best from michael douglas .
it was very very used with water damage to the case . i do n't know which company sent me the dvd ?
this is probably one of the best films in recent years . i really enjoyed , and recommend it . i am looking forward to watch the sequel .
i was surprised by this movie . i was n't expecting much from it but it turned out to be really good .
awesome and a must in your work out program . my husband and i enjoy doing it together . it is something we can both do and feel good about it .
must not have been that great dont remember it even so not sure what to say here except not sure
my whole family enjoys watching it together . it brings back a lot of memories . being in blu-ray makes it even better for viewing . highly recommended for big and small kids , young and old adults .
only saw the preview but a very good show . very strong and powerful . fun to watch and boring at all .
who doesnt like the matrix movies they are non stop adventure and action were ahead of their time for sure .
this movie is great , it makes you want to see it again . the actors were really good in this movie , a must buy
i really enjoyed this movie ! ! kept me on the edge of my seat ! some scenes could of been done better
this is a great police show and i do n't normally like police shows . it is gritty , real and human . very believable .
i truly enjoyed the acting and the actors . this movie apparently is true to dickens ' life and it is an amazing life .
loved the original and i love this . steve martin is the greatest . ellen green is a fabulous singer .
definitely not the duke 's best or the film makers best . however , still an icon when it comes to westerns though .
i bought this for my daughter , who loves it . she is interested in fashion and said this was a must for you library .
this one is well done and a classic masterpiece . the acting is top notch and the effects are pretty good and convincing .
i love john wayne movies . i watched them as a child with my family . good memories . i would recommend this movie .
the movie was great , but it was a little bit hard to follow . much better watching it the second time .
a very good , simple horror flick . not the most original plot , but very enjoyable . mostly solid acting .
cant wait for them to come out with new seasons . at times it can get just too stupid but it 's funny .
love it i was looking for this movie a long time had the vhs ca n't find it so i bought the down load love it
we loved this well acted movie ! it was funny and had story that was well told . too bad more of this did n't happen in real life ! !
arrived in great condition and on time . michael is a singer who can sing anything and make it his own . i just love his voice .
this was so good that i ordered copies for my friends . what a documentary ! it grabs you from the very start and stays with you for a long time . totally stunning !
i took my daughters to see this many many years ago , and i knew my grandsons would like it ! such a cute movie with a great message about friendship !
another white house attack movie . this movie is action packed and there are some fun parts in the movie.i m a big jamie foxx fan .
the dvd has special features and the movie itself is the best . disney movies are the best thank you : )
i like to watch some shows and this is a way to see the ones i like since i do n't have a tv hooked up right now
i enjoy jesse stone : tom selleck 's superb . this episode has a lot of jesse . set up for the next episode . dialogue much like the old noir films . fast , furious .
another of disney 's fun movies . it is great to watch all these years later
this is creativity at its best . the writers on this show are great ! i really enjoy watching the actors on this show .
i am a classic movie buff , and these shows may be b and c rated , but nobody can find this anywhere else - i am so happy !
just classic ! where else can one see batman sing and dance in new york ? ! ! ! great musical for the entire family !
great movie . probably one of my favorites of the year . absolutely hilarious . it takes a lot for me to give a 5 star rating , but this movie deserves it .
awesome season once again . you will want to get the fifth season right away after you watch this . the whole series is amazing !
i saw this movie the first time on tv . i fell in love with the movie . i am a huge sam elliott fan so i knew it had to be good and decided i wanted to own it
i give this product five stars because it was a gift for a friend . he really liked it . i recommend this to everybody .
another of clint eastwood 's best films . i wish it had been in high definition , but it is still a great film . amazon prices are just right , and the service is excellent .
love sandra bullock she is great . this is a feel good great chick flick . i love this show . it is a great chick movie
i remember watching this film a few times as a kid . this has been the first time that i saw it since then . this was as good as i remembered it to be .
i have to tell you , i had none of the problems the other reviewer had , i have this set and the horror one , and have enjoyed nearly all of the movies on both .
this is a fun look at what we thought the future was going to be . the show was skipping over a few things from the movie but is humorous to watch ,
good story about a variety of people and events that impact their life . it 's nice to see a movie about older adults .
ca n't get enough of this - love the collection - hours and hours of laughter at my house , my friends enjoy this collection .
i rated this a 5 star cause my sister in law likes this move and i got it for her
hey we have the first 2 , it would n't be complete with out the 3rd . robert does such a great job being so serious . just makes it even funnier .
excellent comedy . witty . if the rest of the episodes are as fine as the first episode i may be up all night watching them .
it has so many classic bits and pieces of horror movies but seems to combine them into a truly unique movie . it is getting a bet dated but still one i enjoy watching every year or so .
im a beatles guy and i love it its a cool interpretation and its a fun watch . a decent re-watch also . have fun .
my collection of i love lucy is finally complete . i watched it as a kid and she 's still fun to watch today .
great music , great dancing . the more i watch it , the more i appreciate about it . i highly recommend it for all ages .
this is one of my favorite movies . its kinda a comedy , kind of a drama . i saw the musical version in london , not as good as the movie !
talk about eye candy ! this movie sure has a lot of it . but even with all the great bodies the storyline is real and dramatic . highly recommend it .
i love both of these actresses . oh my goodness , i laughed until i cried . melissa mccarthy gives new meaning to funny .
taylor is great in this one , he looks very nice in this movie , i am a big fan and i would get this all anytime
loved this season . i still liked season one better than this , but i was pretty damn entertained nonetheless . watch it !
the personalities of these four actresses blend for delightful comedy . writers continue to be entertaining in their portrayal of these characters .
this movie while predictable at times , does have an unexpected ending . overall i enjoyed watching this film and there is solid acting in it .
cant wait for the next season to start . my son turned us on to this series . my wife and i could not just watch one episode at a time . thanks amazon prime !
this story makes a person really think about things ... the unknown . i recommend it to everyone - whether westerns are a favorite or not . it 's just a good movie !
i purchased this as a christmas gift for a true fan and because of their love of the team and it 's history i rated it a 5 .
this comedy with burt reynolds is so funny . the movie had a good plot . for classic movies this is a must for any library .
my husband and i both loved this movie and actually watched it twice in one weekend ! the acting was outstanding and a very accurate telling of the story !
i love this movie . if your a fan of vampires , you should watch this . there is a lot of action in it . : )
this is a great boxset if you are a stephen king fan ... .i got this boxset as a present & i love it ... .i would recomment this boxset .
this was a good sequel to the first . its a great movie with an all star cast . it 's definitely worth seeing .
good movie if you like military movies . good addition to my video library , i would recommend it to most . thats all folks .
ok so it 's a cheesy flick that did n't really challenge harmon 's true abilities as an actor . but it was fun , saw it years ago and wanted it for my dvd library .
this is the only copy that i can find that has the original star wars . it is great to find a copy left with out all the horrible added stuff .
this movie had it all -- a good story , a good cast , sadness , joy , determination ... i was drawn into the movie . well worth the time .
thought it was going to be entertaining , instead it was boring and crude . worst film ever rented on amazon , had to turn it off could n't bear to watch the end .
it 's a good movie with an excellent movie stars as brad pitt , buy it .
this is a very good show in my opinion . i love the actors and found it originally on netflix . watched every show from the first one and was hooked like a good book .
this is a must for superman fans - great - also had old george reeves as superman on it ( i watched as a kid )
but , now i ca n't stop watching ! ! it 's like a history lesson , only way more interesting ! ! i am enjoying it very much !
myself and family all loved this dvd and it is just a real fun fill family dvd ! good service and great price ca n't get any better !
my entire family really enjoyed this movie . i think it makes a difference when you know it is based on a true story and that people with true courage and integrity still exist in this world .
so i have an hd bluray player and this cd would not play on it so i was very disappointed . therefore i can not give it the rating it deserves .
if you like anime with humor you 'll love this . i bought this for my son who collects anime and it 's one of his favorites .
a lot of action and tom cruise plays a great tough guy . robert duvall comes on late to provide a bit of comic relief as only he can .
i bought the movie for the dance scene and then discovered i liked the whole thing . great story and something for everyone .
good movie , scares you big time , it is tense , and the graphics from dvd to blu ray are awesome . i 'm still waiting for the other 2 to be in blu ray .
i was thrilled to get this . big fan . i can watch this over and over . it got to me very fast .
i love kim possible show that why i miss all the show so i have to get it on dvd . so you can watch it over and over again .
i bought this movie for myself because i just loved john wayne and there are certain movies that i had to have and this was one one them .
... again , then again and again , or again , but again , perhaps again maybe then again after seeing it again and again , but definately again one more time just to be sure !
no matter how many times we watch this series , it still keeps us laughing !
this is the second time to see hunger games . jennifer lawrence is truly an amazing talent for someone so young !
kind of gets boring about half way through the movie . no , i would not recommend this movie to anyone . just expected better acting and special effects .
it was a decent movie . way to many movies out there to get so specific about any one movie but this was a good 2 hours of escape .
if you like bruce willis or if you like die hard movies then you 'll like this . the & # 34 ; son & # 34 ; was a good addition . i 'd watch it again .
this is a good movie that shows the substance of genuine childhood friendships . one of those movies you enjoy over and over again .
love this movie , love this genre , disc came in in very good condition . no problems with this one at all .
loved this movie ! four of my favorite actors in one movie together , a well written script , and good support . it was great fun from beginning to end , and did not disappoint !
the only reason to see this movie is to check out the two & quot ; heads & quot ; having sex . which means the movie is really not worth seeing ...
it just could n't be ! i 'm gon na sell the other 2 and get this . this is so cool ! man this is is gon na be so cool !
how wonderful and innovative . if you ca n't inspire with this one , you wonder what it would take !
for the most part the set was in good condition . however , the first disc was scratched and was forced to order back to the future by itself .
i thought that this movie was great . i liked to watch it and i would recommend this to someone else
dragged on and just made me want to go to sleep . a waste of a great cast .
loved it , loved it , loved it ... ... he always says the right thing . he is so much fun to listen to and watch . a must have if you love good clean comedy .
i loved this movie it was very funny to watch with the little creatures they are fun to watch over and over again
it has been awhile since i saw this movie , but i love john wayne in anything , but love him in comical roles .
this movie is great and was delivered promptly in great packaging . it 's fun , family friendly and actually funny . i can not say enough good things about this product .
this was a gift i picked up for a friends kids : they enjoy it very much each time they watch it
i just loved the show so much that i had to get the dvd such a funny heartwarming show and really talented cast of characters . will definitely get season 2 also ! !
this is a good example of how bad a movie can be , what a terrible sequel to a good movie in the first behind enemy lines .
i used to like this series when it was on network tv . this dvd brings back pleasant tv memories ! i like it .
this is a great story . the main character is really creepy and makes you wonder how many other little kids are just like her .
a classic with a disney twist . great value , all discs and the digital copy included . if you like disney , or want a holiday movie with a twist , this is a great program for you !
this was an interesting movie . they should really remake it if they have n't . i think it is just as appropriate now as it was then .
great story , great acting , very real to life -- this movie grabs your attention and holds it to the end . i do n't know how the oscars missed it .
great western . keeps you thinking . if you like westerns of old this is a must see . good family film to watch .
i loved this show when it was on television and nothing has changed . it 's still one of the best shows out there . i only wish the first four seasons were available as well .
we have a tradition of watching several classic christmas movies every year & this is one of them , have to have the version with boris karloff .
it was entertaining and has the action that is lacked in the book . nice twist and surprise even to the fans of the book series . worth seeing even if you do n't like the books .
these old musicals bring back childhood memories . old films with the stars of the past make for an enjoyable evening .
this is a movie that is really dumb , but extremely funny . diaz did a great job as did most of the other members of the cast .
have watched a couple episodes . it seems like an alright show just nothing to write home about or spectacular . will watch a few more but think i will not watch all
the product arrived in 2 weeks in excellent conditions . this is a very funny dvd with no more than what is told it has .
i purchased this item after i started watching the american version on the syfy channel and although i have n't watched it yet , i know it is going to be great ! ! !
movies was good but i must say isnt my favorite . maybe thats just me . but the last 1 was soo much better
fred and ginger at their best very entertaining and their dancing is superb . a must have for anyone who loves dancing
enjoyed this depiction of the bible story . the music is good and the characters really bring the story to life .
i really enjoy the newer bond movies over the old ones . all though they are all classics : ) very satisfied customer ! looking forward to purchasing from this seller again .
very fun , family friendly and think it should return to tv so kids can watch it after school instead of some of the shows that are on now ...
bought for a gift for my son . he really enjoys comedy . it was a nice addition to his dvd collection .
wanted this after watching it on netflix ... so i purchased it .. i am glad a i bought it .. now i am looking forward to the believe movie
this is without a doubt the best transformers series out . very in depth and captivating characters . looking forward to season 3 .
i was n't sure what to expect so i was n't too let down , the actors and the movie itself are alright but a cute movie is n't my type .
just right - gets 10 stars from me ! excellent movie - vendor : thank you soo much ! i enjoyed sooo much - keep up the good work !
this is the superb ultimate musical , its the very best of the best , hands down ! there is nothing more to say .
all of steven seagal movies leaves a great impact on me . to watch him move and talk , wow , what else can i say . buy this dvd
this movie was so good , i bought another one for my granddaughter . its hard to find good clean movies anymore .
this is a wonderful movie ( quality and all ) that has a serious but funny message attached , and you will leave with a very good understanding to what has happened to our america as we know it .
i had seen the movie a long time ago . it was just as good as i remembered . would recommend it .
daniel craig is looking a bit past it , but the acting performances were very good . i like the introduction of a new m .
i just finished watching this movie on lifetime . i really enjoyed it . it had a great story line , beware though ... it 's 4 hours long ( with commercials ) . : )
hilarious and entertaining . just like all of mel brooks ' work . i have always been a big fan of mel brooks .
i had this movie on video tape . it is a modern classic , so i got it on dvd . i need the second movie to complete the set .
very enjoyable concert . viewing dvd is almost as good as seeing the concert live . recommend purchasing this dvd .
this is a classic series . it was great to own it finally for a very decent price . it keeps me coming back .
one of the best i 've seen in a long time ! ! ! i thank god that i own it ! praise jesus ! get this movie and you will not regret it !
love , love , love this series . : - ) this is the second of the series that i have enjoyed , and can not say enough about the series and the characters .
i understand that they only made 6 of this movie with karloff , do you have the other 5 ? ? ? . i would download them today .
really funny . yeah . kind of . then it gets pretty old . but i will say anthony and jamie really out did themselves in this one .
i think that this was the best of the series so far . i do hope that there are still movies in the making . they are actually half decent to watch . lets have some more .
i like the movie . my boys have watched it 1 million times . i would recommend the movie . i like all 3 of them . i think will smith and tommy lee jones are hilarious together .
i love this movie . it is funny , sweet , and touching without being sappy . definitely worth buying !
good storytelling with a quirky point of view . i watched it with interest although it was obvious how the story would turn out .
this guy is very very funny . the routine is clean so ok for kids to listen to . it is well worth watching .
i like this show , it was good . most anything kate hudson plays in i like . it was funny and silly
bought this to complete my collection . this series is a must have . it 's as funnier than you remember it because now , you can actually get the jokes .
dead again has many twist and turns and you might find yourself trying to figure it out before the answer comes . good luck with that . great script and even better acting .
this is a good family movie . my grandchildren love it . they were quite during the whole movie . it was worth my money .
quite simply a classic -- fantastic ! ! ! this is one of the movies disney made in england . pretty much all of those movies are terrific !
this movie has everything in it to make you feel it all from the bottom of your soul ... it hits home on so many levels ...
movies with this kind of plot tend to drag . they are too predictable . its too easy to see where its going . there is little or no suspense . this was no exception unfortunately .
i did not enjoy this movie as much as the first couple in the series . it is still good but not the wonder with the first harry potter . it is also a little too dark .
i found the acting superb . but , the movie a little too slow . though , i did like the way the story was told .
thoroughly enjoyed this movie . i love the romance developing between the two main characters . i watch this one over and over .
i read every book and watched the films ten years all to get to the final battle ... and it was glorious .
in a word - super . this is one of the best films of its genre and will be an outstanding addition to your collection .
again excellence in the comedy field of sitcoms . now i have to purchase season 4. ca n't wait to see it ! ! !
this was my very first blu-ray purchase . it looks spectacular and i recomend this buy even if you already own the dvd , it 's worth the upgrade .
these are done every bit as well as a hollywood production . both actors are excellent as sherlock and watson . hope to see more of these in the future .
i originally thought this movie was going to be a sleeper but as the plot of characters began to develop i started to understand the real concept of the story which i enjoyed to the very end .
loved the movie because of the meaning of the movie . would recommend this movie to anyone . would like this movie in dvd `
i liked the new way the movie found a way to project terror . it used a completely different type of story and version of what is scarey than most recent movies .
on all movies for kids he like them , thanks will buy more its only a movie not much to say ok .
my mother loves these old movies and the price was right i would recommend this movie if they are the types of movies interested in
this is a classic and no matter when i watch it i still cry at various scenes , great classic movie
i love old movies and i like to host a black and white movie night every once in a while for my friends . we enjoyed this collection , very crisp image and great sound recording .
very long movie but pretty good story . did n't expect too much bit turned out to be better than i thought
hilarious romantic comedy . enjoyed this so much more than the better known white christmas ( which is just a horrible movie ) . even the kids enjoyed it .
i had already seen this movie several times on vhs . i wanted an upgrade to dvd so i bought it . the dvd is in great condition . i have no complaints . : - )
we love these series . we watch it every weekend , and truly enjoy every episode so far . i wish today 's movies were made like these .
this is an interesting combination of lost world and time travel . i have really enjoyed watching it with my prime membership .

simon baker is such a good actor . who would n't like this show with him in it !
purchased this movie for my grandchildren . they seemed to enjoy it very much . thanks to amazon prime for many movies for all of the family .
i really liked this bond because pierce brosnan is in it and i liked his girl in the one too .
buying all three of these classics for the stated price is a real good deal . these have always been 3 of my favorites with john wayne .
this movie is really funny . it is better the second time then it is the first time .
if your a fan , then you should own this in your collection . if you are not , you need to get this and check it out . such a great show . great acting . great scifi stories
i really love disney movies , especially the older ones that i grew up with , and although this one is a little bit newer , it is a really great one !
this was a great story and movie ... i can watch this over and over again and never get tired of seeing it .
this is one of the few movies series that i would show to my kids . very clean and very well done , much like the first one . well worth watching .
an excelent series . it 's a must have ! the laughs keep coming every time i watch it .
one of my favorite star trek movies . it 's wonderful to see a younger tom hardy do a magnificent job in his role .
this is such a great coming of age movie mixed with some eerie stuff too . stephen king always does it right
i chose this item , because heard it was a great movie , i would recommend this item to everyone of all ages , item packed great .
i 've watched this movie since i was a kid and its such a great movie ! action , adventure and comedy . : )
my husband and boys love the walker series and this is another great one to see ! ! i recommend getting this .
you ca n't go wrong with this installment of national treasure . it 's fast paced , gripping and all around great picture . another fun ride ! .
if your into vampires and scarey things it 's quite good set it 's worth getting it .
i enjoy the program but missed most of the 5th season . i like the fact i have the option to do so with my kindle .
spectacular scenery and amazing footage of not only the snowy river area of australia but of some pretty amazing horses and some of the things you have to see to believe .
very bad movie . very slow at the beginning and the end is just plain ridiculous . the idea could be developed to make a much more interesting movie . definitely not recommended .
this movie showed our aged . we actually were around to see these shows as they were presented to the public .
awesome cast . great effects . good story even if you have n't seen the other series . would definitely recommend checking it out .
not as hilarious as the first movie , but was still funny . this is worth seeing , a pretty good movie . thumbs up
great movie - my hubby enjoyed this one - he loved watching the series and this is what i believe began the series . he was really glad to receive it for christmas .
i watched this many years ago and the movie stuck in my mind . enjoyed it again and happy to add it to my collection .
i always enjoy the ice age movies . great animation and characters . light-hearted and good for some laughs . bonus for the kids -- there is always a lesson that is learned from the story .
different kind of humor from your typical comedy . that 's what makes it so good . definitely recommend this movie .
my husband is the true blood fan , so he loved it . we now have them all to enjoy ! thank you .
i 'm a big fan of the old musicals and this is one of my favorites . i recommend it for anyone who has n't seen it . i love it .
i have loved this movie since i was kid . one of the best movies of all times . not much in to syfy . but this is worth it . amazing movie .
this film is well done and spencer tracy shows what a superb actor he was .
this is another hit ! the transformers movies are all great movies , full of action and incredible cgi ! this movie is ( in my opinion ) a must-see . you wo n't be disappointed . love cgi !
somewhat amusing movie about characters i had a hard time caring about played by actors and actresses i never saw before or since . on the other hand it did not cost much .
yeah i 'd watch this silly movie and did n't understand one thing about it . why do n't they just spell it out and show what the bible say ?
we love the show . great writing , cinematography , acting , suspense . it has it all ! ca n't wait to see the next show !
this is a very funny , and entertaining movie . a great comedy . lots of action and humor to keep you entertained .
not as good as the first movie , but still pretty good . missing something . the acting was very good so it is a good movie .
sadly this was the end but i would definitely like to see more of this . really nice series , very humorous .
this is easily one of my favorite movies ! and now that i 've forced it on my daughter ( like all parents force their childhood movies ) , she loves it too lol
one of my fav shows as a kid , my little ones watch it over and over til i get sick of it
saw this on amazon.com dvds and thought it looked good so brought it and it rocked like to see more movies with the leading ladies
this movie is a good movie . it is a family movie . i bought this to finish my collection of jungle book . highly recommend
this show is great , and this season was no different . great stories and great characters , i highly recommend the closer .
the sherlock holmes movies are great one 's to experience . robert downey jr. does an incredible job in playing this character .
yes margaret , they do n't make them like this any more -- i guess i am too nostalgic , but even with the new movie special effects these oldies are better in many ways .
i thought it was a pretty decent zombie movie . i think the story is fine , the zombies are creepy but not so nasty that i did n't want to keep watching .
if you like quirky movies , you will like this movie . it makes you laugh , cry and think about how actions can effect other people . definitely worth watching , in my opinion .
the cinematography was good . good effects , good sound . the story was a little too far out for us . i thought it was too graphic and too violent .
a fitting ending to a great series . enjoyed immensely . recommend to young and old ! ! you are never too old to be a kid !
just as enjoyable as i remembered . i am now on episode 22 and really look forward to continuing until the very end . it is such a treat to be able to revisit one of my very favorites .
acting is excellent on every level and mr. jason is the best . interesting look at britain 's perspective , lifestyle and locations .
unlike movies today , these tell a story that is meaningful and well worth watching . epic classics .
great visuals , but a long boring film . bought it based off hype , wo n't make that mistake again .
very good movie robert and jude make a good team . i will order from this company in the future . i am happy with order and movie .
the package arrived quickly and was in excellent condition . we are certainly enjoying it . thanks !
this is one of my favorite muppet movies , it is so cool that it is out on a disney dvd .
this movie is so touching even the funny parts make me tear up . it just proves you do n't have to have blood , weird characters and/or violence to make a great movie .
i bought this tape for my great nephew for christmas also because it was another one of his favorites . i might add that i also loved the movie .
a very suspenseful , action packed and intriguing film . well acted . second time seeing this film and it was as good as the first time we saw it . highly recommended film .
the theme was the same only with new actors . i was hoping for something a bit different but that did not happen .
i liked the first one and liked this one as well , but it 's different from the first one , maybe a little trying to hard ?
nothing much to say here . it 's well filmed , but it 's the story i do n't like . i like happy endings . do n't expect a happy ending on this one . very disturbing .
i enjoyed the movie very much . i had seen it a long time ago , but i 'm glad i bought it .
amazing cast . great writing . perfect story lines . missed the show so much since it went off the air and this has helped .
after watching new tricks on pbs we decided to buy a dvd of the show . we loved it . it is funny and entertaining . i enjoyed the way they solve the old cases together .
wow , this set is wonderful ! the show is so compelling , well-acted and a pleasure to watch . kevin spacey is amazing , but the cinematography and the script are also superb .
we enjoyed this movie . there was action and a story behind it . good all the way through . glad we rented it !
this is a good series and i have all of the seasons . they all play good too . i always liked andy .
paul newman was not just another pretty face . i think this was one of the films that proved that .
love the movie and the disc quality is wonderful . it 's a great one for your home movie library . buy it & watch & enjoy
actually this is more or less a good whole some family movie for my library collection from my past history
these are a great series of films and if you love tom selleck as i do you well really enjoy the characters .
like the story line . i can relate to the stars in show as they were of my period . good for those over 50
it was ok , not close captioned , however , i was able to enjoy it , not sure if i loved it , but it was okay
most of of have seen the movie but the special features offered with this one are a plus into seeing what goes into making a movie and the interpretation of some of the scenes by the actors and director .
just another teen show . always having to out do and out smart the adults , and life is never fair for kids .
the movie was so entertaining . the grandkids loved it as much as i did . it had a good moral story , to love our land , and take care of it .
watched this as a kid , very silly and campy ; however , some of the shows make it work . this is silly fun for when you want to laugh .
to begin with , i like the character superman and i love the action in this movie . the best superman movie ever .
i love the die hard series and will watch every single one that is ever made ! i love bruce willis !
saw the movie on tv though it was a good movie so i bought it and love it thank you
movie night movie night movie night movie night move night move night movie ... ... ... .this is i do not right i hate doing it take to long
not quite what i remember as a youth but still enjoyable enough . very british though , with some now very out of date views of the world .
this is a very heart warming christmas movie that is good for the whole family and that i have enjoyed over and over again .
this was a great movie . it 's full of action , has a great story line and a superb cast . denzel is fantastic as always
i found this dvd to be very educational and entertaining . as disturbing as some of the content , i feel it is a story that need to be told .
a great collection for those interested in wwii history . was recommended to us by a veteran , and my history buff husband is very happy with the quality of this set .
certainly a b rated kind of flick . gory in a mild kind of way in comparison to some movies in today 's choices .
received promptly in good condition . was a good copy . enjoy buying multiple dvd 's that i want but not at new prices .
both goldie hawn and george segal are in top form . this film is just raunchy enough is be really funny .
my wife told me she loves the quality of the videos and she is going to buy the rest of the set of his videos .
better then the original . it had a good pace , and awesome fight sequences . better then the original . it had a good pace , and awesome fight sequences .
this is a timeless classic which shows that those people from the depression era experienced a lot of what might have taken place in england during the time of dickens .
a lot of action in this movie . its not at the top of my most favorite movie list but it was still pretty good .
awesome , the service was fast , and exactly how the product was described to be ... the movie is very awesome by the way .
worthy film with view of the scenery on the other side of the channel . better than the french , dubbed version .
i got this for my mother and she loves it . i think she now has all the seasons . she watches them more than once and still enjoys this show .
this is a very cute movie . i have two boys and they both love it . i think it 's a good one !
i got this collection for my mom , and she stated the first disc was n't t & h , but it was still a good movie . she enjoyed others as well .
have always loved this movie , since it first came out . as my wife says , it is a great & # 34 ; heart & # 34 ; movie . highly recommend .
what can i say . roseanne is a good family show with comedy and everyday life issues . roseanne is a legend ! i grew up with the show .
fast and clean delivery of the 4th season of this wonderful series ; quality of product of first class and great price .
great movie all disney movies are the best to own never get tired of watching them i own a lot of disney movies
bought it for my grandson , it was in very , very good condition , enjoyed watching with my grandson and you will too !
i quite like this film and do not consider it a low point for spielberg . i find it very romantic and very much worth watching . i only wish it would be released in blu ray .
we were bored and did not view the entire movie . somehow it did not keep our attention . ca n't say why exactly . just not our cup of tea .
very enjoyable series that i go back to see over and over . characters work well together in a great story line .
it was a good movie . denzel washington gives a dynamic performance . the plot was good and though some parts were a little unbelievable , i really enjoyed it .
i could n't wait for it to get here and i 've watched it twice , going on my third . love it . i ca n't wait for the new season .
the story line is good and the acting better than good . if they had left off some of the language and the unnecessary rather explicit scenes , it would have been a much better movie .
great movie good price . awesome if you like transformers at all or just seeing them for the first time .
right from the beginning as always . kept us enthralled . hope that there will be more coming . jeremy renner is a good replacement for matt damon who was also very good .
you can not beat a movie that the rock is in , i just love him as a hero . this is a keeper
love these movies from when i was young and glad i got my hands on them , even more glad that they were a two pack !
i loved this series . dvd arrived quickly & in great shape . since i ca n't have the show back , this is the next best thing . thanks

love bible movies . this one is done very well . really enjoyed it . the scenery is very good and keeps you interested .
newest wes anderson and i love it ! probably the best one so far ! if you like all his other films , just watch it !
the one anime series worth seeing over and over . i never get enough . so , i bought seasons 2 and 3 also . ca n't wait for more .
i got my husband hooked on this series the end of last year and he and i love watch together .
one of the best movies of all time . a must see . action , drama , and an emotionally touching hero story . you must put this on your must see list .
thank you so very much ! i love this cute and musical classic , and i 'm so happy i can enjoy it with my son ! great in every way !
this was a great film to watch . i am a sucker for christmas films and love stories . must have film .
product arrived early and looks to be in excellent condition . have not yet viewed this dvd yet so i can not comment on it 's content or how well this movie was made .
this was a really good movie which i wanted to have for my collection . i think the musical version did justice to the original film .
this is great dvd addition to my tv series collections and it arrived on time in great shape . would buy from this seller again .
i love watching these ! have bought all three seasons ! worth every penny ! ! ! classic ! ! ! i ca n't wait to watch the next generation star trek series ! !
i would n't even give this movie 1 star if i did n't have to ! it was super depressing and gave me nightmares for weeks !
love these . life made by the same people is better , but both are awesome to own .
it is a great movie , for children and adults . it has a nice story about friendship and our lord jesus . the 3d is very good and i would highly recommend everyone to get this movie
brilliant movie with a depressing ending . do n't buy it if sad movies make you depressed .
a special series of old time that is on dvd the dvd set was packed well and arrived when expected . i will probably buy more of the series
great movie - makes me cry every time i see it ! it is really a wonderful story with great acting !
we missed it when it was on the disney channel ; so i bought it and i 'm glad i did , & so is my family !
great movie . de niro is incredible in this movie . one of the best car chases ever in this movie . loaded with action and a great plot
this is not one of kevin costner 's best movies . i liked water world a lot better than this one . after saying that it is still worth watching at least once . this is my second time .
dicaprio did a great job playing his part . not a huge fan of the story but probably worth watching once . received the item quickly and as described - no complaints there : )
truly too sad to watch . i would not recommend this movie . i was not impressed with the story line . the acting was okay .
bought this for my boyfriend 's mother for christmas , and she loved it ! this is a great movie for those who grew up watching the muppets and this christmas movie .
great show . i have all 4 seasons on dvd now and ca n't wait for season 5 to be out on dvd too .
this is one of those old movies that you could watch over and over , a great job by bette , i think i will watch it again !
this is a very good movie i thought . wish it had ended differently . his grandfather lived to be an old man in real life . guess i am just a happy ending type of person .
a pretty decent horror film with a few jump scares but no real blood or gore . worth a rent but a buy . once you 've seen it once , there 's no reason to go back
so vibrant , so glad i bought the blu-ray version , it brings the movie to life . i will always have it in my collection of christmas movies .
the scenery is great ! the music is great ! this movie takes place during the depression , and i love to see how it was back then . i think this was very well done !
talk about campy but fun ! if you just want to laugh and not think about anything but how funny this movie is - buy it . this is classic !
clint eastwood is a bad ass . do i need to say anymore ? watch this movie . you will not be disappointed !
if by chance you have n't checked out the justified series you are really missing a really good show . i have purchased the whole series and really enjoy it .
definitely a must have for all dvd , blu-ray collectors . movie is pretty bit boring , but i bought for my kids so they like it .
a wonderful , inspirational story ... from beginning to end . it 's a great movie for couples to see together . a good movie .
i do n't want to spoil anything , but the movie was good overall . i sure did n't expect the outcome of the movie .
this movie is hilarious ! the laughs do n't stop with this great movie ! i highly recommend buying it ! especially , for such a low price !
love this movie from watching it on cable when i was a child . my kids have learned to love it too . good clean fun !
really enjoyed this movie and now it is in color ... .i remember the black and white version and enjoyed that one too .
this young lady is a favorite of my daughter . she does it all . this is a good fiction character for all young ladies coming into their own .
it is a good movie , plus a music cd . at times you have to listen closely because of the accent .
i like the plot of the movie and it seems to flow pretty good . the acting was great and the ending had me tear up ! omg that little girls acting .
i now have all of the seasons of house that are out . i like his humor , though it 's not for everyone .
my kids love dora , and i 'm okay with that . this particular one has a song that gets stuck in my head , but i do n't mind , its cute !
an unusual story line . the people are inside the book and by the time the movie ends you are not quite so sure if you are too or not .
this movie is one of tom hanks better pictures in my opinion . he is not trying to be arnold or stallone . he gives the captain a human aspect that is believable .
cute movie the whole family can enjoy . saw it in the theatre when it was out and had to have a copy for my personal collection .
received this item on time from amazon . always great experience dealing with amazon . enjoyed this movie from mel gibson . one of his better movies .
i 'm glad i finally replaced my video of this movie and got it on dvd , i 've been waiting a long time to do this . it 's a great movie !
i liked this movie and found it portrayed the characters and events from the original source books much better than i expected from something that was coming through disney .
very cute movie . it has a very good ending to the story which parents will like . my son loves the minions !
love the movie . it was interesting my heart almost dropped when they acted like they were going to run over her son .
a rare gem . classic cartoon from my childhood . enjoyed every episode . great for the kids an adults who are looking for great cartoons that 'll be enjoyable for the family to watch . highly recommend .
this movie keeps you on your toes and has many twists and turns . terrific acting , action and a great & # 34 ; who done it & # 34 ; film .
it 's a pretty clean movie overall , and reynolds and bullock do a good job in their roles . a pretty fun , romantic movie when you 're in the mood for that sort of thing .
not what i thought it would be , so only watched for about 30 minutes and then turned it off . sometimes its not what you think it will be .
i really wish they would come out with the other seasons . loved this show growing up & loved seeing it again now .
if you like watching some entertaining history , and feel proud to be an american this is the movie for you . this to me is a classic wwii movie .
i love this series ; i only wish it came on throughout the year rather than having to wait months and months . it is an excellent series .
i really enjoyed this movie , my wife not so much ! it was very entertaining and i would recommend it to anyone ...
what can i say ? this is another disney classic from the story line to the great music in this dvd . my 2 year old loves it !
i loved this show when it aired and watching it now , reminded me of the good old days . the dvd quality was excellent even in black and white .
the show is very good when it is trying to be funny , but the plots are hit or miss sometimes .
both movies were clean and enjoyable with a easy paced enjoyable storyline . worth the money and the time to experience .
this series arrived in excellent condition and in excellent time . any one that enjoys crime dramas makes this a must have .
i bought this for my 11 year as a gift . she has read the series and seen the movie and loves it .
i am delighted to have this film to play when i wish to , which i hope and trust will find its true audience one day .
a tour de force . a stellar cast . outstanding performances all around . an excellent period piece that captures the last days just before the start of wwii .
had been looking for this movie along time thank u for getting it to me so fast very clear movie
i like good ol ' blood and guts . that 's the only reason this got 3 stars ! this was really a `` wrong turn '' . i say enough of these ! should have stopped at 4 !
this is a great movie as well as the second one . any wwii fan should watch both movies they are awsome
a phenomenal movie weather in black and white or color the performance and the acting is very moving it is a timeless treasure that i love to watch all throughout the year
i have loved this movie for decades . the downloaded version on my amazon.com site does not disappoint . audio and picture are crystal clear .
i really liked this movie , i thought it was hilarious ! definitely adult humor , but well worth watching ! and awesome cast ! ! !
wonderful series with likeable characters . really a shame it 's stopped production . and despite what some reviewers say , this issue seems to be complete .
the product was a gift . it arrived on time and the person who received it loved it and has been using the video regularly ever since ! ! thank you !
still love this movie ! it 's an absolute favorite and i still enjoy watching it . entertaining , exciting and so much fun .
i chose this product because i have been collecting disney movies over the years and i am trying to get the whole collection in blu ray . the condition is excellent and i would recommend this to everybody .
i enjoy supernatural thrillers and this was worth a look . it was n't a new theme and the special effects were a bit disappointing at times but overall it was enjoyable .
we had never seen any of the sopranos episodes . having now viewed the entire series , i would recommend it to a relative or friend .
i thought this would be a nice girl flick but was i wrong ! the two actresses can barely act , and the script is only worse . again , good thing it 's a free amazon prime title !
first time we bought this when our girl really attention to this show in tv . and now she ask for watch this show everyday .
fun movie for the kids and funny enough that the adults will enjoy it too ...
the show is very entertaining . the plots are interesting and attention holding . the actors are excellent in their roles . all in all worth the time .
i love dark shadows when it was on tv now i can enjoy the whole collection on dvd any time i would like to watch it . enjoyed it for my years to come .
did n't like this one . the women seemed too desperate for my taste . i did like the ending though . maybe it was just my mood at the time .
i went into this movie with low expectations but it was actually a good horror flick . some good scares . ,
have read all the books ... when will there be another movie ? ? ? ? love katherine heigl ... please let 's have more !
only ever watched the first movie before did n't know that there was a whole collection we love every one of the movies
what a warm , funny , exciting movie . goldie is at her best . i liked the storyline very much . thank you much .
i have always like the three stooges i just which there were more of them i loved it what more is there to say
tradition and it 's the best christmas movie ever made . i could watch it over and over . it 's the true meaning of christmas others before self .
i always like this sort of thing . fantasy , pretty girls , action , sex . this one has it all . a good series and i 'm looking forward to the next season .
i bought this and the other one for a friend and they love them . so i am glad i was able to find it on here .
liked the story line and nice to see what a young actress looked and acted like later in life . good and warm feeling for all .
movie is mainly for the kids , which is why my son enjoys watching it over and over again . the movie is decent for adults , funny when it needs to be , and keeps you entertained .
it was everything i expected , a wonderful show , shipping was very fast . i am very satisfied with my purchase .
i did n't know what to make of this movie from the preview but it was much better than i thought it would be
the grey was very entertaining and kept me on the edge of my seat . liam 's performance was excellent . i also enjoyed the cinematography !
great family movie . my 5 and 7 year olds loved it . as parents , this is much more fun to watch than cartoons .
was extremely disappointed it this movie , it was more like watching someone playing a game , was boring ! the first judge dredd was good , was expected more of the same , but did n't get it .
loved the unexpected plot twists of this movie . great sequel to the first one ! great addition to my horror collection ! love it !
that is what i think about it two dvd where quit bad and not worth watching then but where good
this is a great movie and it shows you what some people will do for family . the rock is great in this role .
this movie is absolutely amazing ! the locations and places are as if you were watching the whole thing unfold in front of you , extremely realistic !
rent it . buy it . steal it . do whatever you have to do to see this film . wait , dont steal it .
this is a wonderful story that actually cast the right actors for the parts . i think this film will give you a good look into genius and into mental illness . loved it .
a timeless classic . i have several versions . this version being equal to the classics and my daughter 's favorite version .
did not find it funny . but that is just me . at least i did n't spend a lot of money on it .
everything you want in a western ; great story line , characters , and scenery . one of glen ford 's better movies . why ca n't they make them like this any more ?
i 'm a great fan of catherine bell , anything she is in is okay with me . what 's next for her something soon i hope .
do n't know what the ideal target audience is . 6 or 7 is too young .
the masters of the universe was my favorite show when i was a kid , and i am proud to be able to share it with my children who enjoy it as well .
love this show . it is so funny , especially the early episodes . i still wish they would release the later ones .
i do n't like scary movies . i did not buy this for myself and have never even seen it so i ca n't advise on it .
did not see this one coming . this was a great movie with a good story line . i would recomend this for the suspense .
3 great actors with good story line . makes you think about issues you know about or get 's you to think , what would i have done . reminds me how lucky i am that my dad returned .
great plot on this blue ray movie . i 've watched it many time as it does n't seem to get old .
this is one of the best movies of all time in my opinion . i got it on time and in perfect condition .
i really enjoyed this movie and the streaming quality was excellent . i had no problems at all watching this movie .
beautiful love story , clint eastwood is great as a romantic lead and meryl streep never disappoints , would recommend this dvd
i enjoyed watching this movie , and it has a good point of enjoying what you have . it was a little too much of a spoof halloween movie .
this did not interest me at all . the characters are boring and the movie is too . would not watch again .
horrible waste of money . this was a horrible movie . we could n't stand it after 30 minutes turned it off and threw it away .
again i am thrilled to see these good movies come out on blu ray . the blue ray with these quality movies are just a little more fun to watch and enjoy .
this was not the best movie i have ever seen . there were some predictable places . there were also some surprises along the way . do n't buy this movie , only rent if you have the choice .
i usually like bill murray movies . this one was just incredibly boring ! not sure why this is considered a classic .
one of my favorite movies ever . the cast was the best and tom hanks was fantastic like he always is .
very funny , a little long , but the jokes just hit the sweet spot . this will clearly be on my repeat watching list .
this is a great series of good family entertainment . you can watch these and not get surprised by foul language or adult scenes .
i would recommend this to anyone who like murder mysteries it gives you all the clues and you get a chance to work it out , very hard
i ca n't wait for series three . i have just about very holmes movie made and was skeptical about his series . i was more than pleasantly surprised .
i thought these movies were going to be alot more fun to watch but all in all they were kinda boring and just very poorly made .
if you saw walking tall you saw this , more action then story ! if you like action you would probably like this movie .
it 's pretty good . plays good too . i love it ! ! i would recommend it . it 's old 3d and not real d .
i ordered both seasons . loved this series and was very disappointed when it canceled after 2 seasons . fun series and happy to have to watch anytime ... especially when one needs a good laugh .
cant wait for the next season ! i love crime shows and this was a good one ! i will most definitely recommend it to crime show fans
picture quality was great . movie was very interesting . i 'm a robert mitchum fan from way back when ! the movie kept my attention until the very end . i loved it .
we do n't usually watch shows produced in the us , but we are enjoying the first 3 seasons . the show is never boring , even though predictable .
awful . they have sucked this franchise dry . i thought it couldnt be any worse than part 2 , i was wrong .
a good balance of story and action . they do n't make it predictable which is pleasant when so many movies get corny very quickly .
love matlock . it is a great show and fun to watch . the character played by andy griffith is loveable and you 'll enjoy the show .
i liked that i was able to get this movie at a reasonable price and that it was in good condition .
i am glad i bought this for my son . i wanted to share something with him that i loved as a child !
perfect ! perfect ! excellent ! thank you ! i really love this movie.i absolutely recommended this ! i will buy some more movies , great experience
it 's a good movie , for people of all ages . this completes my collection of the series . seller did a great job in getting it out to me .
i am only giving it 3 stars because amazon movies tend to stop in the middle to re load . it happened several times and eventually i had to start it all over again .
very good old time western . i wish there were more like this around today .
this has to be the best werewolf movie ever made . the creatures are the best i 've seen and the story is good . best ever . and i 've seen plenty of werewolf movies .
awesome movie . definitely a keeper ! fell in love with it the first time i saw it . ended up watching it twice .
short review : i really liked this movie ! imo , this godzilla looks better than the japanese godzilla ! ( ... )
part two of the series , i liked part one enough to purchase part two an watch it . very serious subject matter , not for kids .
this movie reminds one of the good ole day even when bad thing did happen , it helps us to realize we can always begin in life again and again .
even my kids like them . i 've always been a fan of this series . still would love to have his skill set .
if you are into good and original movies you 'll like this one , tom performance is absolutely awesome , i would n't be surprised if they do a remake
i liked this series ... it was gritty and raw and probably fairly accurate for the times . i liked the series & # 34 ; rome & # 34 ; better because of a better story .
one of my favorite holiday movies ! very good price , excellent packaging and super fast delivery ! my grandson and i have already watched it three times now .
i ca n't wait till the second season is out ! we rewatch it and always see something we missed the first time ! !
this movie is a very cute movie for children and adults alike . my grandsons love it as much as i do .
these actors are not singers . they ruined the beautiful story in my book . it was a dark and dirty movie .
the bible : the epic miniseries [ blu-ray ] i purchased this as a gift and the recipient was very happy with it .
this is a classic movie that still gives me a & # 34 ; creepy & # 34 ; feeling every time i see it . and the ending is great . a must see for sci fi buffs .
it 's not easy to find & # 34 ; clean & # 34 ; movies and tv . matlock is very good for that very reason . i hope additional seasons are added to the library .
great movie and great job ! this is a real collectors film from pixar . will become a classic in time . blu ray is very well put together .
my daughter loves this dvd . she watches it almost every morning and loves watching the animals and other babies while listening to the praise .
this is a good family movie with sound entertainment . i like this one and henry winkler plays in it with a good sense of humor
this preview provided me the opportunity to see if i really wanted to watch the whole movie , which i did . thanks .
i love mythology . i enjoy reading about it , but this movie was way better than expected . in the 2 movies they mentioned every god and the story behind what happened to them .

was delivered in time and in very good condition , my daughter had a bunch of movies in vhs and we are replacing our favorites to dvd

everything about this film and this dvd is wonderful , except that the timing of the subtitles is a bit strange at times .
just a classic quentin tarantino film and up there most of his past ones . i own and still watch it when it 's on hbo
this show is continuing to be good with each and every season . the cast is one that has so much chemistry with one another that it really is truly a great show .
excellent series . got into this show tears ago but lost track of the story . finally gon na catch up on one of my all-time favorite series .
well , i 'm a nicolas cage fan , so it 's good . the story is true enough , sad to say . if you like true crime , it 's worth watching .
grandsons loved it ... one the whole family can watch together . you will not be disappointed in buying this for your children or grandchildren .

if you like seeing the challenges that face people and all they have to go thru to overcome them , you 'll love this movie . there 's something in this movie for everyone .
the script , acting , and sets were great . i like it more everytime i watch it .
we all loved this movie . then again we love nicolas cage in almost every movie he is in . be prepared for a action packed movie .
i will share this movie with other people . so they can buy it and enjoy it too they can play it too .
great classic video set . my family and i sat down and watch these videos and had so much fun just remembering them .
great to keep up with the story line . looking forward to future sets . it is wonderful to follow the life of this boy who is following his dream .
this movie was made along time ago , however its still was a great movie and i really enjoy ed watching it again .
the graphics on this movie are great . the story line kind of weak , but i thought it was ok. i would probably watch again .

this movie is great for the family . i watched it by myself and was still rooting for the good guys !
i do n't write reviews . i have to say it . if your reading this . watch this movie . i can not believe how good this movie is .
i brought the pay per view on dvd because i ca n't afford to order it to watch on my tv that is way i brought it on dvd .
love this show . intelligent and engaging plots , great character development , good chemistry between actors . i own the first season and now the second and look forward to owning the third and every one to follow .
one of the best love stories i 've seen . this one really goes to the heart . great actors . not much i would change about this movie .
i seriously could n't get enough of this entire series ! everything about it is simply awesome ! the actors are not only gorgeous , but the setting and costume is simply the best !
i have been looking for this movie for about two years now and i am glad that i found it here , thank you all so very much ... ...
prince can really make a movie , ca n't he ? ? ! ! ! great movie , great music which leads you into the cd purchases ! ! thanks
such a great movie . great performances by hugh grant and emma thompson . i absolutely recommend you see it if you have n't already .
if you like jane austin and indian movie it is very hart warming and good performance by good actors , good songs ,
these stories are timeless for interest , content and lessons . i wish there were more sci-fi writers like this today and in the future .
a classic that we watch every thanksgiving . five stars belongs to `` a charlie brown christmas '' and this does not come near the quality , so only four stars .
dvd arrived quickly and in good condition . have n't seen this movie in a long time so it was fun to watch again !
this movie is very cute . of course , typical of disney , someone has to die , but in the end everything comes out well .
absolutely love this series ! even better than the original in my opinion ! great action and comedy mix . as well as an amazing plot .
do n't need to say much if you know this movie . it is what it is , has it all , great story , great characters , great messages .
a good story line and animation . a nice family movie , if families every see movies together anymore , that is . it would be nice to think so .
saw it the other day on tv had to get it funny and goofy ... jason lee plays a great bad good boyfriend hillarious
i love this series and so does my daughter . she is collecting all the seasons . she enjoys watching them over and over again .
this movie is not what you would expect , it has action , heart , comedy and horror rolled all in to one , well done story-line that is a pleasure to what ...
this was a very good show , had wished it lasted many more seasons . am still very glad that they put the one and only season on a dvd .
no one makes movies anymore like hitchcock did . if you like his movies than this is a must have . good quality and good movies in this collection .
we enjoyed the movies - but did not get to see all of them . since we have very little time to sit and watch tv , it will take a while till we see all the movies .
i love this movie . i watch this soooo many time when my girls were teenage . i still watch now to get some good laughs .
the moral of the story is that when you talk to someone they are n't really listening if you are talking at them and are n't listening back . fun to watch more than once .
the acting was ok. i watched it the first time . felt like i wasted my time . to slow for me . i would not buy this dvd if i had known it was not very good
that how it came just okay , the sound was good , but the video was poor . to bad i love danny kaye . art
this was ordered as a gift . arrived on time , they loved it ! really dont have anything else to say about it !
this is a wonderful movie , betty white plays a out standing part as a lady on a mission to cross the country
when will season two vol 2 come out on dvd ? almost a year now and if these are consistently being release in volumes then it will take forever for the rest of the seasons to be available .
i enjoy watching these series of movies back to back . i have watched them at least 22 times just because , buy this you 'll love it .
melissa mccarthy was outstanding ! as a guy i did n't think i 'd like this movie , but it was so down right funny ! awesome movie .
this is brilliant gritty british tv at its best . every one in the series is excellent , i thoroughly recommend it to anyone who enjoys great acting ( helen mirren is fantastic ) and strong story lines .
these episodes are hilarious ! i 'm so glad they are available on dvd -- i would never have been able to see them otherwise .
very good series . i have seen all of them after watching morse and would watch more but it is all done
i did n't know if i was going to like it cause of all the bad reviews but it turned out okay .
very , very slow . i 'm afraid we lost interest and stopped watching about half way through . we were expecting better character development .
this is one of those movies that keeps working for days after you have watched it . it is sweet , thought provoking , enlightening and everybody grows .
great movie and so glad to have it in my collection . as great today as when it came out the first time .
this is a good fun action flick for the whole family . i went in to the movie not knowing much about the series but enjoyed the movie none the less .
i was very pleased with my purchase . i did expect the movie to be more bloody , by the way it was described on the back . i did enjoy the movie .
brings me back to when my kids were just starting to get into & # 34 ; music & # 34 ; - this was one of the favorite dance and music movies -- - brings back terrific memories ...
i gave this dvd 3 stars because it 's not as good as the television series . but it 's still good for die hard fans .
my son tried to get me to start watching this for months . i finally did , and was hooked ! ! the writing , the acting is amazing . i highly recommend this series .
it 's a good movie . maureen o'hara was so young ! story is good and the colors are wonderful ! if you like pirates movies you 'll like it no doubt !
the alien invasion is a good premise . i look forward to season 3. some of the acting and dialogue could be better .
very creative packaging of a great series , if you know someone who enjoyed this series they will definitely like this gift !
nice to watch an old favorite of mine in brilliant color ... .the bible is better , but this blue ray movie is a close second .
not as good as the first die hard . a ok story line . but , there is plenty of action . if you like action . this a good one for it .
i remember watching this movie in my teens that i just laugh so much with this movie . i had to have it .
i was so glad to get these as i had missed them first time around . now i can see them more than once and enjoy them all over again .
got this for a really great price , and it arrived quickly . i watched it and it was in perfect condition . i am happy with this purchase .
i have always loved nicolas cage and this was a good movie . it is not his best but it is worth watching .
i just could not get into this movie . it was slow and i was disappointed because i love julia roberts .
lots of jokes that adults will get that the kids might not . makes for a very good family friendly movie night .
great movies . as usual the sequels are not nearly as good as the original . but funny none the less . buy them !
was good and sad . the poor boy had no real friends but his dog that he loved more than anything . then its gone . enough watch and find out .
great movies series . never thought i was a superhero watching person , but i find myself loving these type of movies .
although i love and appreciate daniel day lewis and his talents , i did not enjoy this movie at all because it is dark and weird . i gave it to my library !
this movie introduced me to great music i do n't know how i had missed and a great story . i thought is was well done and enjoyed it . thank you .
enjoyed the movie would reccomend it for anyone who is looking to buy a good movie . would watch the movie again .
i have always been a huge fan of dexter and this final season collection does not disappoint ! i highly recommend !
i love this movie . this is one of the great movies . it has actors in it . i have seen it more than once .
we really enjoy this show , so this was the perfect birthday gift for my husband . we really enjoy the characters and the story line .
i remember these movies from the old days and loved them then and love them now . thank you very much .
i really like old movies and this one did not disappoint . it was a double winner for me because it was base on a awesome piece of history . loved it
how can they still put on such a great show . omg they are the best band in history , lets hope they make it 10 more years
we are fans of this series and a must see if you like the original series and future films coming out a long with wolverine .
downton abbey is the best show ever made . it is a great historical novel . we love it but season three is not as captivating as the others . it is a bit of a let down .
i really likes this one because it was a good show and i miss it . i would recommend this to anyone
though i just love the original black & white movie , i do like this one , too . good to have both !
i liked it . but i thought they could have added more to make it more exciting . in my opinion leo could have done better
if you liked road trip and american pie you will like this one . very funny and some out of hand humor .
i 've always enjoyed this movie and i 'm very pleased to have found it at a reasonable price after looking for it for many years .
we do n't all get the chance to go back and see how our life could be different . even so the movie lets you know there is always time to change and let god do his work .
the vhs was delivered promptly and in good condition . the movie itself was not very good . boring .
my husband loved this series growing up and it stands the test of time . excellent writing and acting . wish there was more to watch .
the price was a little bit much , but its such a great movie i could n't pass it up . buy it ! ! ! !
fair movie for a remake . it seemed to take an extra long time getting to the action though . i appreciated that it was pg-13 so that i could watch it with my son .
i choose this rating because of stars & how well they played their part . excellent , i love a good movie
my daughter saw it and said mom you have to see it . it was very good . actors were good too the ending was a surprise but enjoyable . i would watch it again .
special effects were great and enjoyed the action scenes . i did not fall asleep during the movie . nice spin on a old story
i love learning about morse and what created him to act the way he does . i like this series better than the morse series .
for me the best picture is the first one , the other missed the magic of the first , but i had to complete the saga
i found is enjoyable and with enough twists to make it flow to the end . matthew is convincing in the part .
each season gets better and better . if you have seasons 1 and 2 , you 'll have to get season 3. as always , it keeps you guessing .
just did n't get the point of this movie if there was one ! there was no plot or point !
i almost gave up on this about half way through but it did get better the longer i watched it .
watching this movie , you will be happy to know that christopher nolan saved the best for last . christian bale is solid again as batman , but anne hathaway steals the show followed by closely by tom hardy .
remake of the old tv series , entertaining , but nothing close to the original series .
my wife grew up watching old classics and she loves it . i 've seen older movies that i like better , but it was worth watching .
no real discovery on the son 's part did dad really need to be in the movie ? i do n't think so
bill murray at his best . do n't miss it . funny and serious at the same time . i loved this movie and so did my husband .
awesome family movie .. saw this many times .. many many times .. great music .. great memories . a real feel good movie .. good for the whole family ..
i ca n't say enough good things about this film . it has magnificent . i have watched it many times and never get tired of it . one of the best ! ! ! ! !
you just keep thinking about this movie after you see it , then you see it again . my wife was n't that into it , but i was .
a favorite christmas movie of mine for many years . so glad to have this for my christmas movie collection . thank you !
this show made clint walker a name in hollywood and it 's an excellent western though too bad it 's b & w .
i heard about this movie in one of my criminal justice classes . it was actually really great ! i think it is a must see for everyone for sure . very interesting .
downton abby is worth watching more than once . if you have made it through seasons 1 and 2 you already know this .
thought the movie was funny and comical and the dvd was in decent condition when it was sent to me .
this movie is great , working in an office this movie really makes me laugh more than some . and for the steal of the price i got i had to add this to my collection .
suspenseful , funny , serious , great story , acting - lots of twists and turns , even though you already know the outcome , highly recommended .
loved the story . fun to watch . we own many animated films ( no kids in our house ) . this is one series i 'm sure we 'll end up buying to see it again and again .
i like this movie . i think they did a pretty good job for back in those day 's . this is a movie that i believe everyone should give it a chance .
what a weird campy little movie . not for everyone but i enjoyed this movie . your either going to like it or your not .
this movie was a very good movie i saw this movie when i was a kid and always liked it .

a great performance by a great band . they still have it . a must see concert by a must see band ! ! !
always a good classic to rewatch . we used to own the movie.. not sure where it went . thanks for having it available
this is one of the most boring films i 've seen in a while ! it 's very stupid too . i ca n't believe it was nominated for an academy award . i mean really , come on !
this was the last dvd in the james bond series my husband need to complete his collection so he was so happy to find it ! he watched it right away ! thanks !
there 's nothing like the old cast to bring a smile to your face . if you ca n't get enough of the duke boys , than this is for you
i was n't quite sure what to expect but the movie kept me entertained . if you are looking for something to busy for an evening give it a shot if nothing else is available .
it was okay ... but i think it was a bit cheesy in some parts . it could have been way better . the cast and script are just ok .
this is one of the most delightful animations to come along lately . i would recommend it for both young and old .
i got this for my husband & he just loves it & all his other cowboy movies . very enjoyable , will watch it again & again . the scenery is awesome .
i love johnny depp but not in this particular movie which is basically unforgettable from beginning to end . try again johnny
i had seen this a long time ago , but could n't remember it . stayed up late one night renting it from amazon and enjoyed it again very much .
a huge family favorite . this is a show our entire family enjoy watching . love the quirky characters . looking forward to the next season

this is perfect for horror fans that love bad movies . who really does n't enjoy this stuff ? well worth the money paid for it !
went in with low expectations . it was much much better than i expected . great story line . was pleasantly surprised and would recommend watching .
excellent dvd . would recommend it for children , or adults . price was acceptable , as was the delivery time . will order additional dvds at a later time . i will recommend this dvd to others .
one of the best shows on tv . if you have n't seen it then buy this and you will be hooked !
i have thrown away alot of money on movies that seem to think it is not good unless it is r rated in some way . this is a good movie . try it .
i was really expecting more . if the middle of the movie was all there was to & quot ; vol . 2 & quot ; , i would give it 4 stars .
i love these types of ghost story movies , great effects , and awesome scares ! check this out now !
i really like this movie - good acting , great story , great characters . it is worth buying and watching this one .
wow this was so bad ! ! horrible acting , terrible script , even dee wallace being in it could n't make up for this stinker .
as a history buff , hubby really enjoyed this . he also has watched numerous other movies about lincoln and found this most entertaining .
i was introduced to this film so long ago as a kid . my parents loved it and so did i. still a hilarious film with some great comedic actors . a must see !
yes , watch this movie . not at all like all the other serial killer movies out there . some of the surprises you can guess , but the twists will surprise . well done .
this show has me glued to the tv wondering what will happen next . i was a little skeptical of the real time following of the show but it works . you wo n't regret watching it .
mel brooks is a comedy genius , and this movie will forever stand as one of his best and one to watch over and over again .
i love this series . it is just wonderful . the characters are so real to all of us . we get emotional over their ups and downs .
this is a great action packed , humorous movie . we 'll watch it over and over again ! got ta love a family that works together !
this series is filmed like a movie . i can usually figure out the ending , as i 'm sure many of you can . it is no so with this series . anything could happen .

great dvd and fast service . this is one of my favorite movies . i was so happy to add it to my collection .
i like old horror movies and christopher lee is one of my favorite actors . i enjoy this movie and all other movies he is in

all the three movies are the best in him style , christopher nolan take this franchise to next level , very best ! !
classic movie . story has a twist at the end . bogart and the rest of the actors delivered a fine performance .

we always enjoy the jesse stone videos . we would enjoy seeing more , but i do n't think there will be any . great mystery and very entertaining . jesse stone is a very compelling character .
if you are looking for high quality transfers of the flash gordon series , image entertainment is the best . sound is clear , images are crisp and focused . the box set is by image .

i fell in love with the couple in this film , and i got the dvd so i could share it with others .
this is one of my favorite movies of elvis . now my selection is complete . one question i have is how did they keep his hair so perfect during the entire movie ?
you are gon na like this quality old time movie that has great acting , good story line and just a lot of fun .
these are very funny westerns with a great story line that will make you laugh for days .
this movie is more like a 3 1/2 stars but worth the watch if you have most of the other new releases .
love harvey , and jimmy stewart . enjoy watching it over and over . one of the classics that everybody should have in their collection .
my grand daughter was very anxious to have the disc and it was a lot to wait for it . the movie is great .

what waste of money and my time . they ca n't act and the plot was stupid . i want my money back
i love this show great entertainment for the whole family . i wo n't stop until i have the whole series ; must have
it is a very good film and it has lots of good scares including laughs ! it was funny yet it was also very creepy and gross ! : ) it is defiantly a must see !

if you like movies by tim burton with johnny depp , then this is a must see ! great movie , very funny , and gives good insight on what it was like then to make movies .
this is one of my favorite hitchcock movies . so suspenseful , exciting . jimmy stewart is always so good in hitchcock 's movies .
this movie is artistic and depicts what life is like in peoples heads when the world is n't perfect because its not !
the best thing about this set is the cover picture . i found the stories dated and with little or no scare .
almost a five but they cut all their stories to exactly 100 minutes and sometimes leave the story short .
hated the movie . tyler perry was just so-so as cross , and i actually fell asleep watching it , which never happens to me . enough said .
this movie is a great family movie . action that any kid would like but clean . we loved it and recommend it for family viewing .
it was good , i wo n't watch it again , but what matters is the person i bought it for has enjoyed it : ) and has watched it twice . bravo !
im really sad that this show is over , one of my favorites and i loved the plot and cast , well worth watching
i do n't understand why they do n't make more movies like this . i really wish they would . it was so good .
we so enjoyed this musical and the actors/actresses in it . it is a fun movie to watch for easter or any time of the year . both the sound and the picture was great !
a different story that i expected . interesting but not really engaging to the viewer . not really impressed with the plot , but it was n't a total waste of time .
what 's not to love ? i just wish there were 10 more discs . i could watch steve martin all day . sometimes i do .
this anniversary set is great , you get the blue ray and dvd discs and for the same price as you would pay for one .
beautiful story about faith and suffering . my friends and i enjoyed it tremendously , we 'll be seeing this story over and over .
not a bad movie but have grown to expect more from matthew mcconaughey . it 's worth watching in your a fan .
had us on the edge of our seat ! very suspensful . twisted plot , was n't what we were expecting ! do n't watch alone !
bought this for the kids to watch since they are thomas fans . would consider this one of the best one 's yet !
this was a christmas gift purchase for our adult son from his wish list . he is a die hard fan and loved it .
we all waited for so long for this sequal to come out and it did n't disappoint at all , loved to see this on amazon instant prime and it was so much less than in the stores too .
book # 5 was never my favorite harry potter book but this film is great . some scenes might be too dark for a younger audience , but definitely great story . buy the whole series ! !
cute movie . rated it three stars as i thought they could do more with the ending . overall enjoyable movie to watch when you do n't want to pay too much attention like you would with something suspenseful
what an amazing movie ! this movie is such a good documentary . very enjoyable . and morgan freeman makes it even better
i ca n't believe i liked this movie , it had good laughs . i ca n't say i 'd watch it repeatedly like some other movies though .
this is a good movie for the family to watch & enjoy during the holiday season . i recommend it : )
this is a great movie . this was in perfect condition . this is a funny movie . i give it five stars . love it
i love this movie and the story line . it is a great horror movie that keeps you on your seat wondering what is gon na happen next .
i am enjoying watching these episodes again . they bring back memories and it is fun to see so many stars .

what can you say . it is a clean movie that you do n't have to worry about with the children watching with you .
this is a sweet movie if you are looking for just a feel good bit of entertainment . worth watching with a friend .
i would n't pay to see this , but it was entertaining enough since it was amazon prime . it did n't cost anything additional to watch it .
good movie . i 'm not a movie critic but i know what i like . a very well acted movie . moving and in many ways disturbing .
i liked this installment of the x-men just because it was x-men , however , i believe the other movies were stronger in several different ways .
as a retired teacher , i am always looking for things to teach my grandchildren . this dvd and others like it are full of learning moments .
i 'm not sure i believe what they say , but the show is very entertaining ! seems to get better with time !
love the suspense , stunts , and storyline . this movie has a lot of action and was one of cage best movies
no one is the comic relief that don knotts portrays -- that innocent humor is safe to leave alone with any child . service was good , product as described . do recommend them .
this movie was much better than i thought . i expected it to be a stupid flick , full of stupid sight gags , but it 's a funny movie .
entertaining and fairly realistic ... but we like movies with happier endings . oh wait , then it would n't be like real life ? ? ?
this was just disappointing all round . not much more to say about it . i like rod taylor , and he was good , but the film just never took off .
this is an especially great video , with many of our favorite singers , and we never get tired of watching and singing along . so glad we bought it .
this is like a sherlock and watson with more humor . the fact that this show is a mystery shows in the lead character but with our all the unnecessary violence that appears on current tv . love the cars
stupid stupid stupid . i think it was stupid . and then it got more stupid . and then it ended stupid . awesome .
season 4 should have been the ending . with the exception of the last show . this really did not grab me .
what 's up , doc ? is a part of my growing up i want to share with my grandchildren . just as funny now as they were when i was a kid .
interesting story in that real historical events made fictional actually seemed a little believeable . entertaining movie , well acted , very good special effects . overall , i was entertained .
this was a funny movie my kids watch it over and over , i think disney should put this show back on
i could watch over and over . it never gets old . i love it.the story lines are always interesting . great
this movie is amazing . it got here quick after i ordered it and he really love it . i would recommend it .
movie too short . but it is a classic . i enjoyed watching it again but as an adult it was not as interesting to me this time .
i was n't happy with this movie . as a matter of fact it just did n't hold my interest enough to watch it from beginning to end .
my father in law has really enjoyed this dvd . i recommend you purchase this dvd for anyone who loves to watch war movies and documentaries .
creepy , good old horror flick . they just do n't make them like that anymore !
this is truly a timeless masterpiece ! ! i still laugh , cry and get angry . it shows alot of sides to how we interact with one another . a must see for everyone
it is a good movie to watch it puts a smile on my face every time i watch it .
this movie was funny and upbeat , very enjoyable to watch . the acting was excellent and the characters were endearing . i found it to be an excellent film .
i enjoyed the movie very much . it was funny and had a good moral to the story . right up there with shaun of the dead .
i really liked this movie . it is a bit twisted and you have to pay attention or it is easy to get lost in the story line but it is a great ride .
at first it takes a little getting used to the new spartacus but it is worth it . this is by far the best in the spartacus series , truly awesome
i really enjoyed watching this movie . the dvd showed up when i expected , in perfect condition and was a great purchase .
good movie . anthony hopkins brings another good character to life that will have you guessing right up until the ending .
i love monty python . what else can i say ? if you like british humor and slapstick silly then you will too .
i had so many people recommend this movie to me . it was a pleasant and unexpected delight . we love it .

it 's two of the best movies ever ( part i and part ii ) . if you have n't seen it , who are you ?
classic and funny , this sports movie actually surprised . i did n't realized it was going to be enjoyable to watch . great cast and i like it when they play off each other . a definite watch .
friends , just buy this movie , you will not be sorry , it is absolutely hilarious ! vintage kurt russell and the plot is simply engaging !
this guy is so talented that you wonder why more people do n't know about him . i 've seen him twice in person and this is almost as good . try it you 'll like it .
great quality blu ray . loved the cast and story . in spite of what some reviewers ( critics ) said this is a good movie .
this is an oldie but goodie . i first saw it years ago and catch it on tv whenever i happen to see that it is on . i finally decided it was time to own the dvd .
it was a wonderful movie . i would certainly watch it again . i cared about every character . maggie smith always delivers .
i 've always loved this movie . great cast and acting . the extras included with this one are very interesting , also . highly recommend .
good film , kind of slow sometimes , but it keeps a reality to it . shows how people 's lives get strange .
i loved the movie and i love the actors . it was the second part and it was just as good as the first one .
enjoyable sci-fi series that brings a new level to science fiction series , interesting subjects and excellent humor without any over drawn blood and guts , and crappy humor .
deep space nine is a great addition to the star trek universe . a must have for any star trek fan .
even though old , it has been updated by technology and is worth watching again . i will never get tired of this excellent presentation by ken burns .
my daughter loved dora when she was 4. she watched it over and over again .

i bought this because i liked the movie . dvd was in excellent condition . that is all i need to say .
this was awesome in blu-ray and i wish it was available in 3d . very cool movie with some great effects . i like all the actors and actresses in this .

michael j fox and the other actors have great comic presence . well written and worth watching , since nowadays nothing good is on regular tv ... .

even when i 'm not a sex and the city fan i must say it was a good movie ! : ) thumbs up ! !
a clever premise for a comedy but paced much too slow . you might need someone to wake you up to find out how it ends .

great action movie made all the better with my favorite action heros all in one movie ! ! i hope expendables 3 will follow ! ! !

there are n't a lot of female action stars kate nailed it with this series great story , cast , direction , etc ... very glad to add to library will be doing future business
great for kids of all ages . a little more dark than the old shirley temple version , but still good for kids .
i knew it was old , but it 's kind of corny too . we did n't watch the whole season , just was n't that good for us .
modern day fairy tale love story . very well done acting superb . nice to see feel good movies with no violence !
all musical and ballet dancing it cool love gene kelly . if you enjoy dancing this is the movie for you
if you 're into that type of thing then you will enjoy this film . i however , am not and did not .
i guess i did n't realize the story was written for a 14 year old audience . it was ok , it just was n't as good as i was expecting
i could watch vincent price in house on haunted hill over and over . this ( the legend films version ) is the best . extremely well done .
i enjoy the inspector lewis series and series 3 did not disappoint me . i will order more in the future
did n't think 1 person and some nature could hold my attention as this movie did . richard parker really could have been best supporting actor .
this movie just shocked me on what this man did but very sad but the production was very well done and would definitely recommend this movie to others .
i 've been buying these dvds because i loved the show as a kid . the package is really well done . glad i bought these and i will get season 5 when it comes out .
a very cute and funny movie that i had to have for my library . kids will love it . adults love it too . minions are so cute ! would recommend to all .
we have had this movie in dvd for years . it is quite the fairy tale and a great family film .
loved these movies since i was a kid ! now i have them on bluray ! highly recommend them to any one who loves johnny five !
one of my favorite actresses . what wonderful classic movies . i ; m proud to say i own these . i would recommend this to her fans .
like all larry david episodes . he is a very funny and great comedy writer as well as a comedian for everyone to enjoy
even though im young . i still love the 80 's and 90 's show . i always laugh when watching this . its a funny , corny show , and would recommend it to anyone .
the character actors are wonderful . this movie has an amazing message we all need to hear and live . growing old is hell but this movie points out what a difference our attitude makes .
i love christmas time ! yet another good movie to warm the heart during the holidays !
just do some look over some others and you will find around three more of this nature of better value , though unfortunately for some reason not rated as highly even though as good or better
this is a great show . good story lines , characters , acting and scenery . hope they keep making it for a long time !
the movie was n't for me to view so i ca n't give you much of an answer . my husband loves this movie
i remember the first time i saw this movie . i actually did n't think i was going to like it . i kept watching and can say i thoroughly enjoyed it . great for the family .
true to memory these videos are short , educational , and entertaining . the dvd contains all the videos , even if the previews make the production of the dvd seem dated .
debbie does a lot of singing it in this flick . the story is n't too bad - kinda cute . it 's good family entertainment . i recommend it as being worth watching .
it was a solid story about family and love . it was everything the tv series ( 1st season ) was along with good acting , directing and story . a great family movie .
i did n't watch it but was told it was a persons favorite so got it as a gift for that person .
this is a really good christmas movie . different from most of them . it 's nice to see henry winkler in movies .
i would have to say this is one of the favorite movies . it really is awesome .
i had a lot of expectations for this movie , they were not met at all . another waste of time for me .
my husband and i use to watch this show every week , we love it ! ca n't wait for the next season !
classic . i 'm a big sandler fan but this is his true best . a funny funny movie .
wonderful old movie ... why do they not make them like this anymore ... we really enjoyed watching this again
just an all around awesome movie ! ! i love it . the kids love it we have watched it several times now with out getting tired of it lol .
this is a very good movie , i love anything with dean martin , he gives a great performance in it . i was very pleased with the prompt service and good quality .
this is a fun box set . i received it as a gift and the whole family enjoys it , even the kids .
what can you say about getting 50 movies in the pack with the price being pretty low . the quality is not great what is good . great for any collector .
i love this film and have watched it several times . the purchase arrived ahead of schedule and the quality and price were excellent .
same vampire concept but with & # 34 ; future old & # 34 ; twist . buy it you 'll like it . short but sweet with a good ending .
my family loves this show . you never know what sherlock and watson are going to get into and then you are not sure how they will get out of it alive .
this movie was so awful that i 'm not even going to waste time writing a review about it . just take my advice ... do n't waste your money on this piece of junk !
really a good meeting . not expecting such a strong story line . it was n't oscar worthy , however , its a mark wahlberg
how can you go wrong with this ? it 's the first show in years that has been refreshing and new in plots and scenery . great item to purchase !
i wanted to like this a lot more than i could . it was hard to follow the film . i liked the premise , the actors and the cinematography .
it was a waste of time and money . it 's the film that you get the best scenes from the trailer .
my family enjoy going through all nine seasons of which we have now . we find it is really funny and sometimes an example of what not to do . product arrived in good condition and on time .
tom selleck is great in any thing he attempts . tv , movies , he 's a class act ! if you like cowboy movies , you 'll love this !
really cute movie . full of action from the start to the end . ca n't wait for the next one to come out .
a christmas present for the great granddaughters . they love dora but this one seems newer than the regular tv shows . since they love to sing and dance , they will love this i 'm sure .
fun movie . enjoyed it but not something i would watch again . excellent cast . good photography . a bit & # 34 ; overdone & # 34 ; for my taste .
clint eastwood always seems to make a great film . hope he stays at it for a long time to come
what more can i say ? this movie may be campy but it is good comedic fun . bruce campbell does n't disappoint . i highly recommend this movie .
i bought this dvd because the price was good . i could not get it for cheaper anywhere else . it was received very timely .
i know this movies got great reviews but i just do n't get it . it 's a ok movie but not great at all . did i miss something ?
if you like superman this is probably already in your collection . if not , you 're probably just holding out for a better price ? regardless it 's a good movie for it 's type .
this has been my favorite comedy show ever . the dvds and the case are in a good condition even after a while .
i loved this movie . not only was it very entertaining but it was n't loaded with bad language as many are . i ca n't wait to see red 2 !
it was n't as good as i thought it was going to be compared to the others but in time the series normally does n't die down and is n't as good ! !
i enjoyed the mental break watching this silly movie . will smith and tommy lee jones are great together in this sci-fi flick .
the music is bad , batman is stupid , the film is very very bad .
pretty okay . dialog could have been a little less contrived , but overall it 's an entertaining movie . worth a watch . yep .
we have these fights still and i for one would want the african american on my side i truly do n't see color
it was go good to see this again , as i had forgot some of the episodes . wish they had more shows like this now . i would recommend this if your a star trek fan .
cute story , nice acting . enjoyed it very much and will probably watch again in the near future . this type of movie is always great to relax by .
a fun movie musical all done with kids . i saw this as a kid and loved it 's hard to fine . family friendly for the kids pop some corn and have a fun night .
this is my second time watching this season . i love the sg-1 stargate series . i find the characters and stories intriguing and very well done . you never know what will happen next .
love you whitney : ) this movie was great . there was great acting . loved every minute .
good movie but have you ever seen a bad movie with & # 34 ; the rock & # 34 ; in it . i am a female and i would watch it again .
thought this movie had a good twist for a scary movie . was nothing like i expected which was a pleasant surprise .
wonderfully funny , and every bit as good as the first one . this is one sequel i can honestly say is worth watching !
this is a great great movie.. my mom and i sat down and have watched this movie a dozen times .
not academy award performances , but was something i watched as a child . if you watched shows like buck rogers , then this is about the same quality . enjoy ! ! !
laughed so hard ! this is the first madea movie i 've seen . loved it ! especially her scenes with the children . i 'll watch more !
this is for my collection for when i go cable free soon ... i ca n't wait to go cable free i like to choose what i watch and when i watch and i love the pause .
good movie . i do not mind sub titles , so this one was up my alley . good acting for a foreign movie with a decent story line .
came fast in good shape . love disaster movies but have not had time to watch this one
this movie is soo adorable , very cute ! i highly recommend for any young child or adult ! very cute movie ! : )
this package arrived early and was a surprise for someone who is a fan of the movie . he was excited .
all i can say is this band is the standard by which i judge all others .
cool movie , good story and characters and i love the music . i felt like the female character was me . love this movie
i ordered this because i wanted a copy of the second season . i have n't watched it yet . if when i watch it there is a problem with the dvds amazon will replace it .
very interesting movies in the way that it can go back in time to see what has happened to figure out a crime , very well done
everyone should see this one or have it in your library ! it 's nice for the kids and adults . get it
very entertaining show with lots of little lessons contained here . characters draw you in and make you care . i really enjoy watching this show !
delightful movie with beautiful scenery . have been a fan since it came out several years ago on the big screen .
loved this show as a kid . and it 's still alot of fun to watch . man it brings back a great deal of memories .
i just could n't get enough . loved it . waiting for season two . very very riveting , constantly keeps you on edge wanting more and more .
that show was so touching to me and it was wonderful and great and i love it very much it is great .
i love british television shows , but usually stick with dramas . however , i came across this show and after one episode i was hooked !
i loved this movie as i did with all the other pbs ones . they are a joy to watch any time .
great movies , have added them to our move library . we just love these old time movies . back then there was little special effects and true acting . recommend to everyone .
fun movie and pretty funny ! enjoyed it very much ! there is a lot going on in the movie and johnny depp acting was top notch ! ! !
i really was expecting something much better but this was still good though i would 've enjoyed something a little more exciting though
this i have loved forever . the colors and costumes and the music are wonderful !
i would recommend this movie to ww2 movie buffs . it also has big name stars , wayne , and the like , well made
it was okay . pretty boring n not really worth the $ 5 rental price . it 's def not a movie i would rent again .
this was n't as funny as his other stand up comedies but it was still pretty funny . i would recommend it .
this movie is absolutely hilarious . it has great music with a lot of comedy and fun . one of the best movies i have seen in quite some time .
full of quirky characters these shows are a lot of fun . they kept me watching just to see what emotional disaster would happen next .
i liked this movie . it did have flaws . very many flaws . it was fun and cool otherwise .
one of the first five films he starred in which are clearly the best a great film for 80s action fans
great show . i ca n't wait until they release season 5. the producers captured a time that has long since past .
one of the all time enjoyable films . great acting and cool story . i enjoy watching it again and again . delivery was fast and complete .
i did n't like it at all brad pitt looked old and the zombies were gross and stupid book was soo much better how could they get it so bad
this movie received fantastic ratings and i cant figure out why . the two main characters carry on a dialog throughout the entire movie with no real purpose .
this is a good story about a woman 's life and what she goes through . it will keep you interested , especially about her love life !
when i got the move i could not wait to watch it . it was like the same old thing over and over and became very boring
i love it i love it i love it , i recommend everyone to own it i have watched it many time on my netflix account but decided to buy my own copy .
who would keep having children just so that they might be killed for sport ? this was very boring . glad i did not waste money to see in the movie house .
this definitely built on the matt damon character , and presented a likeable character in the latest adventure . car chase and he got the girl , what else could you want ?
dated movie that was not hardly entertaining . if you are bored and have nothing else to do you might want to watch this movie .
loved the first one , but this one really fell below par . i had expected a whole lot more , based on what i had read from critics .
i could n't watch this movie and not think of the matrix . very similar , but different as well . i may need to rewatch to really understand the ending .
my daughter and i love this show . it has such a good heartwarming story that the whole family can enjoy .
i am very happy with this purchase & i recommend it highly . if your already a fan , then you know why . check him out on youtube and you will too .
i have always enjoyed this movie so i finally decided to add it to my collection . this original is better than the remake . i love the cast and they give a great performance ! : )
i love this show and i could not think of a better way than to see it when ever i want to .
this is still as much fun to watch as it was when it was first released . in some ways it reminds me of the hitchcock movie the trouble with harry .
grew up watching this series in the 60s , was both entertaining and educational . sadly , shows an american culture that is all but gone today .
a very fun movie . great photography through out the film . good action with a great adventure story to go with it . i highly recommend this film to anyone .
i watch this every year at thanksgiving . its a fun movie about what really matters in life . i bought my sister a copy this year .
this is a great children movie . it has a great storyline and . i recommend this movie for all children .
all four seasons of this series is great , they do not make westerns like this anymore and the color episodes are nice
if you 're looking for family fun , this is a good movie to pick . it 's hilarious for all ages . and you do n't have to worry about it being inappropriate .
the movie is great . i love it , and it came just as described . there were no flaws with it . i was pleased .
just a so so movie but had a better ending than i thought was coming . the main characters were strongly played .
very intense movie with great acting . enjoyed the photography , the story line and the two actors who make the movie . redemption story
most of the super man movies like segal movies where he never can be hurt or loose i do not care for . jason statham for some reason are more entertaining . maybe better acting , who knows .
my sister loved receiving this movie when i gave it to her with others for christmas . i will certainly be ordering more for her in the future of this type from amazon .
it 's got some high points but it definitely fails to meet the level of fun the first movie had . just trying to go over the top too much
it is very good and cute movie , kids like it and dvd is good condition . thank you and have a good day !
i do n't want to spoil the movie but roy did a superb job in the powerful film about personal redemption and forgiveness of one 's past mistakes .
typical arnold film with lots of action but same theme as usual . it was an ok film to watch at home
i only remember catching the trailer when it first came out , but when i finally saw it i was pleasantly surprised . a little dated , but still lots of fun to watch .
until you have seen this movie , you have no idea . that is all .
good adventure for the entire family . shows the coming of age of a young man , and it was fun to see a father and son movie .
was always a great tv police drama when i was a child . i will watch it all the time ! ! !
m daughter liked it but i was not impressed . the movie had potential to be a great story but fell short by bad acting and unbelievable characters .
what an interesting story and so well done . really gives a lot of insight not only into this family but the history of europe during that time . great ending ! !
ground breaking season one episodes in very nice quality ! i decided to watch them in broadcast order . highly recommend . enjoy .
i got to say that arnold and sylvester play excellent roles in this movie . the plot is great ! this movie is action-packed . the producer has an extraordinary imagination ! this is a must-see .
series moves really fast and can make you tired , but you always have to suspend disbelief . too way out , but fun .
i love old cartoons and this a a terrific collection . the sound is good and picture clearer than expected . thank you amazon prime for making this available for watching free ! !
the watch is a funny movie . i saw it on tv & just had to have it . i recommend this movie .
i gave it this rating because i thought it could have been more intense and exciting . it 's what i call a middle road picture .
it is not a classic but it is still a good movie . actors not very well known but good performance .
another great movie and i was truly impressed with the story line , along with fight scenes . another keeper for my collection .
this was a good show about two guys who hooked up , messed up , and broke up . a little hard to follow but kept a good pace . a good show .
my kids are 6 and 8 now and they just love spongebob . i 'm so glad i have the prime membership so we can watch this season over and over .
this is the kind of movie i love to see ... relatively authentic , good pacing , great costuming , and awesome acting . would love to see more of these type of movies about other historical figures ...
this was an ok film , just not what i expected from a denzel film , i guess i am so use to his action roles . it was ok .
i was a little in shock for the first episode , but i decided to give the rest of the series a chance and got hooked on it !
gave as a gift and it was a treat to watch wonderfull classic movie for us all to share , thanks
good movie that ties in kinda ties in with the first paranormal . interesting feature of spanish characters as the victims of the activity .
tried to watch this film . i really did . but it was so boring and charlie sheen shows again that he ca n't act . i turned it off after watching 30 minutes .
the movie was bit overdone , with quite a lot of gun use . but , with fabulous acting by two aging well grand actors .
this was a blast . loved how the movie moved along . and how things could go really bad very fast in life .
this movie always gives me a chance to laugh . chevy chase has some pretty decent movies out there and this is just one of them .
i am rating the quality of the blu-ray dvd . the blu-ray version is definitely worth buying . visual is great and sound is perfect . spend the money and add this to your collection .
it was a feel good movie and i enjoyed watching every minute . did not expect to like it at first , but it drew me in .
i love to dance and was trying to help my mom get into shape and she is n't so great at dancing and even she loved it .
one of my favorite movies . such an intriguing plot and we 'll developed characters . you really love who you 're supposed to love and you really hate who you 're supposed to hate .
i love the re series , but for me this one sucked . there was not enough zombie action , just slow motion stunts . no real action like in the other movies . i was bored and really disappointed
this reminds me of my childhood , minus all of the commercials . if you like the tv specials but would rather watch it on your own terms , get this !
one of my all time favorite movies and robin williams is great in this role , it is one of those movies that you can watch over and over .
a must for all sam elliot fans who collect his movies . two movie of his that are not as well known as others .
like i have said before that i am a big fan of bleach and can not wait until bleach uncut 18 come out .
if you saw the first one and liked it then you 'll love this one ... .this one had some different twists and was def a little more scary !
this is one good movie for the whole family , especially for your high tech kids if you have any that is ?
i saw this version of zorro when i was a child and fell in love with it . it is one of my favorites !
nothing like the first one . it does n't have the original cast and even though i like the rock this just was n't him movie .
not the greatest movies ever made but it is nice to re-watch them on blu ray and recall an earlier era in movies .
this was a gift for my sister ... she rates it a 5 ... i think it 's a 1 ... but we all have different taste
probably my favorite tv show out there . this is a great addition to add with the first two seasons i already own . well worth it ! !
the music , the story , all of it is fantastic ! the kids watch this over and over , and the adults love it too ! ! ! !
angela lansbury was right on target on this final season . i now have them all and will enjoy seeing them over again .
my grandchildren love this movie ( i do too ) . great purchase . i will purchase more instant videos in the future for sure .
saw this movie the first time in europe , in the mid 80 's , and enjoyed immensely . nice improvement over the vhs copy i still had . would recommend to everyone who enjoys a cult classic .
this is an all time great collection to have it draws you in and never let 's you go a movie for all ages .
my husband use to watch this show as a child and we wanted to show it to our 11 year old .
we loved these old shows growing up , and it is great to be able to re-watch them , especially the christmas episodes , this many years later . corny , but fun !
great action video and special effects ; best i 've seen in a long time . kept one engaged . willis was excellent as usual .
i usually do not rate movies very often but i am such a big fan of bronson and this one is one of my favorites .
i enjoyed getting the entire series at a reasonable price . i stopped watching over the years and was most happy to see a product in one package .
we enjoyed every minute of this movie . it only left us wanting for more ! ! !
this was ordered for my husbands movie collection that is growing and will continue to grow over the next year
i have always been a fan of the pink panther . it is nice to reflect back and watch the original episodes .
just like all the other reviewers , i could wish for a different ending . but for that it would be 5 stars .
watched this with my grandson and we both enjoyed it , very informative , and educational . would watch again even if grandson is not here !
the high school of the dead : complete collection [ blu-ray ] , i very much enjoyed this anime , if you love anime and you love zombies just get it , you wont be disappointed .
i ordered this product for my grand child and she loves it . i 'm very pleased with the manner in which it arrived .
i like the fact that i get the dvd , blu-ray , and you are able to download a digital copy . also , the are some really cool features on both blu ray and dvd .
just plain good fun . heston and brian keith are great together . sit back , enjoy the scenery and the humor and experience a part of western history that did not last all that long .
i have read all of the twilight saga books at least 3 times and i have seen all the movies at least twice . love all of them
another john wayne movie i bought because i love all of his movies . this one is one of my favorites .
i absolutely love this dvd . worth getting if you like the british comedies . great watching !
in keeping with the my `` short and sweet '' title , do n't waste your time or money on this stinker .
great show ! arrived quickly and without any damage , i would definitely recommend if you are a fan of the show .
the twist at the end is great , the whole flick was action-packed ... not able to see through ( all ) of the twists , kept you watching ! !
excellent . this movie made me want to buy mrs. keith other books about her experiences . a classic .
this is not an academy winning film . it is a fun look back at one of burt reynolds films . nothing more nothing less .
love george lopez very talented actor very funny good sense of humor would love to go to one of his show and would recommend this dvd to anybody who has a good sense of humor
really good movie if you enjoy silly . we laughed a lot . even the husband stayed awake for a change and laughed with the rest of us .
i really wish they would make more than 8 episodes every two years ! this is for the entire family and we all enjoy the storyline .
unlike anything i have ever seen ! laugh out loud hilarious ! i love this show ! ! a must see cartoon for anyone with a sense of humor !
this was one of my favorite batman animated movies . great story and a lot of fun . kinda on the dark side . i enjoyed it . bluray looks amazing
both my husband and i live this movie . it is great , we wish that we could have gotten the uncut version but i guess we have to buy the regular dvd !
this film was recommended to me and i was not disappointed . it will hold your interest all through the film .
awesome movie as were all the twilight movies . got this movie to try to complete my set and cant wait till breaking dawn part 2 comes out to buy it

i must admit this movie had me laughing the entire time . i bought the movie just because of jeremy renner , but was pleased with the movie . it will def give you a laugh .
this is one very fine western with the best western star of today sam elliot , great story , and beautifully filmed . plus you ca n't beat the price .
a quiet little drama . michael kitchen 's understated acting sets the tone for the show that does n't hit you hit you over the head . a fine cast with good scripts . well worth watching .
there were a few cute spots in the movie but a little on the slow side . the concept was unbelievable .
love this show , i was very glad it came out on dvd . thanks amazon for having it in stock .
this movie was a very pleasant surprise , that far exceeded my expectations ! the characters are fabulous , the storyline very engaging , and went from very funny to incredibly inspiring in a moment . i loved it !

diamond head dvd with charlton heston is a great video and if you like charlton heston , you will like this movie .
i love scifi so was happy to add 'the island ' to my collection . cast is great and story is n't complicated for confusing .
it would be good if they would slow it down a bit . it 's hard to keep up with them . i guess it 's meant for younger people .
i had seen this made for tv movie many years ago and was glad to see it was available on dvd . i enjoyed it .
a story about a boy and his dog ( s ) . very heart warming . an ideal family show which will have you in tears . recommended all the way .

the ice man knows his stuff . i could just sit back and watch this over and over again . this is when music was really music ,
i ordered a few of these because it 's a wonderful continuing story of friendship , family , and romance . it is a comedy too as well as a drama . worth purchasing !
i choose this movie because the storyline was intriguing . i purchased it when the price offer was less than $ 4 . it turn out to be more than worth the purchase price .
it wo n't play in region one . did not return it for a refund . this is the second time this has happened .
i gave this away as a gift and they person loves it . it came on time and no damage to the package .
this is one of stephen kings best works . it 's a great movie to watch with your older child . if you do not wish for your child to have nightmares , wait until they are 10 .
save your time and money . this movie is all about saying the `` f '' word 2000 times , along with a lot of bad people and aliens . disgusting ! !
remembering this show from when it first aired . so i wanted to see again . better than the movie . like to watch on trips .
rich and interesting . i really enjoyed this documentary , especially the spiritual history . this film makes me want to travel to india so that i can experience it for myself .

love this movie , it is hard to find and amazon has always been my go to place to find things like this .

i am giving this movie 5 stars because it has good biblical and life morals to it . it also is especially helpful if your marriage is in trouble , i would recommend this to any couple out there .
we missed a lot of this the first time around , so now thanks to amazon we can watch the complete series
good movie but not very funny like you might think since he is a comedian actor . most of his movies are like that though .
i love this film - it is great to see in glorious black and white - but it is also very enjoyable in color - if you love 50s science fiction - you 'll love this dvd , larry
i like this movie because im a fan of superman i would recommend this movie to my family and friends
it was a cute movie but not nearly as good as the first one . however , sandra bullock is a joy to watch regardless of the material she is given to work with .
if you like raunchy , stupid funny , this is the movie for you . i like funny , and stupid funny , but this is not one for the whole family .
very boring , lousy acting , just overall a not good buy i cant even give this away it sucks so bad
i really enjoy watching this movie over and over again ! its a great sequel ! it 's definitely on my top 10 movies !
could watch it more than once , and still enjoy it . this is the fourth time viewing the movie ; i can see watching it four more times .
i recommend this movie for all families ! a walk in my shoes movie is great ! please watch is now ! i known this movie for families and its really good !
it 's a wonderful movie that 's still relevant today . you ca n't always go home but sometimes every once in a while you can & everything works out just fine in the end .
liked this movie thanks for getting to me fast . would use this seller again
love this one ! they do n't make this type of animation anymore . : ( very sweet story .
i really like this movie . it definitely gives you something to talk about . it proved to be a little weird for friends , but i liked it .
my wife 's mother loved this one so much we bought her the dvd . now she can watch it as often as she wants ... putting a smile on her face .
this movie was very entertaining for both adults and kids . i 'm looking forward to the follow up movie when i get time to go out and buy it .
i was n't sure what to expect from this movie . i had a lot of friends that said they loved it and after watching it i would have to agree with them .
thought it was a good anime if just a bit short . i believe they could have made another season of it given the storyline . overall good and would recommend it to most people .
i consider this a must in my collection with many named stars . good story set in ww2 behind the main fighting lines . james cagney is the quirky captain and jack lemmon 's comedy is great .
i did n't know about the foreign film number 2 issue and ca n't play this on my players .
no digitally remastered but it brought back the childhood memories just like i wanted it to ! it was definitely worth the money .
lots of extras and episode intro by lucy 's daughter and excellent picture quality and a good buy for the money
they are learning a great deal , wow they can really turn it on and make you jump up and keep you in it .
this series is always fun to watch . it 's too bad it did n't have more seasons . the movie is a must also .
terrific film ! my son and i are collecting japanese film and art and this fits nicely into our collection .
this is such a fun movie ! i really love the humor and wit along with the slapstick comedy . katherine a cary at thier best . an all time favorite .
not one of the great movies , but it is a fun movie for those who enjoy mysteries as well as those that enjoy comedies .
i love this show and i laughed my butt off . this show is so well put together . the deleted scenes on the dvds are awesome .
this movie does n't suck . it 's certainly not the best of the original series movies , nor is it a particularly good movie . it 's still an ok movie though .
this movie is bad ass period ! ice cube rocks his role every time on this bad ass movie ! everybody should have this movie in your collection !
came in a little later than expected but it was in perfect condition , i have no complaints other than receiving time , perfect condition though so in the end that is what really matters i really appreciate it !
i have always been a big fan of these types of movies and would highly say you must buy this film if your into these kind of movies .
this movie is worth renting to watch . the story line is old , but the special effects make up for the rest .
you love action movies ? this is a great one to watch ! it 's full of drama and stunts . it 's also very scary if something like this was to happen !
i expected more action , but loved the actors in this movie ( both are favorites of mine ) but it did drag a little . but ... ... worth watching for a slow evening .
i 'm not a big owen wilson fan , but this is amazing . i love it . great photography too .
my son and i really enjoy this series . i have them all now . for the indiana jones lover you well like this also
this a really good film for all the family . great animation , well written , good actors . this one is a classic .
ron white is one of the best comedians around and this dvd is no exception ! well done with great comedians .
not many deleted scenes ... no extra gore ... nothing much in directors cut of interest over the original release sorry not that good
it 's john wayne for goodness sake . what 's not to love about watching the duke in one of his greatest films .
i have been waiting for this movie to come out on blu-ray for a long time . movie played in great quality and i am happy with this purchase .
wonderful picture . two great actors . to rate a good picture , you do not need a lot of words . you either like it or you do n't .
wish i had known there was an extended version , i would have gotten it . i like the ideas the artists came up with in this movie . quite challenging .
i like the two together in shows because both men are funny and compliment each other very we 'll . good to watch with company or to laugh alone .
yes , it is somewhat like alien but there are many more horrors and a decent cast involved in this . fun stuff .
there are like three or four stories going on in this season but what i love about this show is they do n't lose you .
this movie is very slow starting and almost half way through it too . based in the 70 's if i remember right .
one of the last good series on tv . as usual the early seasons were the best and they are the ones i recommend
there is a lot action in this movie . but it was better than the first !
i fell in love with this movie years ago because of the dance . not much of a movie plot , but still an enjoyable flick .
good movie glad to have it it it watched it several times good good good very well done good good
movie is very good , full of adventure and one of my grandchildren 's favorites . arrived quickly and as described in ad .
i love this movie and feel the actors really bring the story to life ! they all have great chemistry and work really well together .
i heard from a lot of people what a great and funny movie this was . i guess maybe i do n't have the same sense of humor as they do . it was an ok movie for me .
this was a very good sequel and depicted well from the book . i can not wait for the next two movies .
i lost my copy and was happy to find another . so happy i bought two . one for myself and one as a gift .
this is my favorite in the friday movies , so i 'm enjoying this -- everything was great - and i 'm a happy customer !
love a good series this is season 5 and there are more to watch plus colin farrell in a tv series is a bonus
like it but they needed to ad more color to the movie good clear dvd but it needs more color movie is great arrived on time
i used to watch this movie when i was growing up because i was such a big julie andrews fan . it still makes me laugh just as much today as it did back then ! ! !
the first movie is fabulous but the other 2 are a waste of time . paul walker is n't in them and i do n't know why they were even made .
the main character is really talented to play so many characters . the writing is great . this is a very boring review but now i have used up enough words to give it a good one . ; )
not bad but not great either but since its free on amazon prime hard to complain .
this is a great movie and the price was just right for the hd version . the download was a little slow but this is a very long movie . otherwise enjoying my experience with amazon prime !
this was a very good movie- a really sad movie with a lighthearted ending . based on a true story . yes i recommend it , but have some tissues handy .
i believe i now have the entire series if not i will continue to look for the episodes that are missing
are you a james bond movie lover ? if so you will like this one too . lots of action as expected for a bond movie . loved it ... .
have n't seen the last movie yet , but amazon really had this at a phenomenal price ! so i got this collection for my husband for christmas and i 'm sure he 'll be pleased .
more twists , less illness storyline , made this season more enjoyable for me than season one . looking forward to a new adventure
one of the greatest cartoons of all time . all ages will enjoy this and if you 're a fan of batman then this is a must watch .
i remember watching strange days when it was in theaters . i loved it then and still love it . the mix of scifi with who done it makes it a great movie for almost anyone .
its a good zombie movie , good to own and watch , great for a zombie movie collection , but if you had to chose between this one and another one , this one would be my 2nd choice
this is a cute continuation of the first movie . it is funny and the minions are hilarious with all their antics .
this by far is the funniest movie of the year . i laughed so hard , so long , i had to watch it twice .
very cute movie . it was very enjoyable . i like these what if kind of stories . nice clean fun too . okay
what can i say about the mothers in law . a real classic show . a real family show . they do n't make shoes like this any more . a must have .
really enjoyed all the characters and their interactions after a war . well done . long but well worth watching . will not leave you with nightmares !
the movie was pretty good and entertaining but it was obviously made for kids . my wife and i enjoyed the movie and am looking forward to seeing the sequal .
this has been our favorite for many years . to find it all in one package was fantastic . we will have many hours of pleasure .
nice little movie . ok , but not great . i just felt that it could 've been better , but i did enjoy it .
awesome movie for kids of all ages , . the graphics are awesome and the story is good too . my daughter loves this movie and laughs a lot throughout the movie .
fun movie on hbo , need to by because of the attention it got after seeing it , and because everyone was talking about it .
pick this title up . excellent image , incredible sound , original theatrical aspect ratio , and some of the most interesting special features i 've seen in a collectors set in a very long time .
happy to have this to complete my collection . love the movie and am happy to have purchased it here . great
this movie seems like it was going to be a unique movie but i found it to be long and drawn out but never really going anywhere .
great film . much better than the american remake . i highly reccomend it !
one of my old time favorites . so happy to be able to find a copy through amazon . love the old classic films and this was one of the best !
nicolas cage was excellent in this movie and we had been looking forward to seeing it . did not disappoint us .
australian movie and the words are sometimes a bit difficult to understand . but the script is so corny and the outcome so heart-warming . i 've watched it a number of times .
great show and was glad to be able to see it here after missing it on broadcast . ca n't wait for the next seasons
this is an old fashion disney movie . it is okay but lacks clarity and a complete story . the acting is fine for the time it was filmed . i can recommend this movie to the whole family .
clint and morgan played well together . it moved a little slowly , but the acting was decent . too bad there will not be a sequel !
this is a must have for the serious comic book fan ! the animation is crisp and beautiful . the story is intense .
i 'm not much on chic flicks but this one is great . if you have never seen it before you are in for a great movie .
i thought this romantic comedy was cute between drew barrymore & hugh grant . and the music was beautiful ! anyways , i like these two actress and actor .
this was a good movie , and it kept my attention . i bore with movies easily , but not during this one .
i recieved my dvd earlier than expected and it was in fantastic shape . played beautifully . i would definately buy from this seller again .
makes me feel so good by the end , love these feel good movies , and helps get on in perspective ! reese is great in it .
this is one of my favorite episodes . i 'm glad that i purchased it . it was a lot of fun to watch .
what more to say but that the british do so much a better job at putting out quality detective series . one of the best and worth seeing again .
brought back a lot of memories from the 80 's . what a wonderful , clean love story . would watch this again soon .
this is a treasure of a movie to own . it 's quality is exceptional a great find . i 'm very pleased to own this dvd .
this is a movie i look forward to watching every year during the holiday season . it is well made and funny .
season five is full of laughs and fun . exactly what you would expect from one of the funniest comedies of the 80 's .
this was not my kind of film . that is why this rating . you may like it more as the plot is complex .
i use to manage a video store and i use to play this a lot it their because it was fun to watch
lots of action and gore . interesting take on classic story . a nice fantasy . we liked edward . not for young children .
nice collection of superman movies . some are a little dated , but superman is a hero and i like the new movie that was included in this collection as well as the older ones .
how simple the old plots were . it brings back memories when tv as meant to entertain with our foul language and violence .
really , people should make more of these : simple and cheap in making , but with so much that hardly is a cheap movie .
held my interest thanks mr. seagal & austin i 'll be looking for either one of your movies to come out .
this is a classic movie . it is the kind you will want to watch many times as the years go by .
this is a great performance by whitney and shows off her amazing voice ! i would recommend this movie to anyone who loves action movies and great singing !
i enjoy following the quirky characters they are what makes this program such a success . enjoy every season and this was another great season . keep up the good work .
and i liked it . different , kinda hip and acted well . i will very likely watch the rest of the first season and if i continue to like it , all of the shows .
this is a heavy movie . however , the acting and story plot are so good that i have watched it many times . that quality is the reason i purchased the blu-ray version .
this was a great deal . liked the movie and it came with the old one as well . great overall purchase .
always a pleasant surprise . a unique sense of humor . i never miss his movies . at the top of my must see list
what can i say about this season other than you 've got ta have it if you have the other seasons . they are always leaving you guessing on what is next to come .
it passed the time . unable to say it was terrific . not the best , but entertaining . was house bound for awhile and liked the characters .
was home for a visit and this movie came up at my mothers house . she loved this movie , so i ordered it for her !
do n't know how much i paid for it , but it was way way too much ! only bought it because of who starred in it . guess that 'll teach me !
i really love this movie , i 've watched it over and over again . loved it on tv , even better on dvd
love this movie ! i am happy to finally own it . it is very convenient to have in my video library
i saw this and i must say ... ... i like the t & a ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
this was offered at a good price , especially since it was a blue ray package . i 've already viewed it twice .
very educational ! wish they made more in the series of dvds ! we 've got them all !
i kind of liked to watch roseanne for awhile . i still enjoy it . it 's funny the way she acts with her husband and kids .
i love this movie ! it 's very funny . if you like the show then you got ta watch the movie ha ha
i grew up watching this show and when i saw it was on dvd i decided to get it and yes it was worth it and the show is still just as good as it always has been
i have enjoyed the jesse stone series and have continued to add to my personal collection as new ones become available . i enjoy having them to share when i get together with other friends who also enjoy the series
although the acting was excellent , i found the story extremely uninteresting and visually rather boring . i stopped watching after 45 minutes and i doubt that i will ever return to this miniseries .
too goofy at times . would have preferred it follow the storyline of lone ranger more . depp good . hammer sucked . still worth a watch .
i loved this series when i was young and now that i 'm old i love it even more . highly recommend .
nothing bad to say at all here . this movie was awesome . the hulk and thor were incredible . really funny too !
never get tired of watching these great ole ' movies : ) still entertaining and delightful . all that graphic gore is not necessary to enjoy a flick ! ! ! !
i watched this movie and truly enjoyed it while it is violent gritty the acting is well done . i love the movies that are set in the 40 's and 50 's
i bought it as a gift . they loved it and watched it on the first day . it is a must have for any movie collection .
this is one of the best seasons i 've watched of any political show that is on right now . hope the second season is just as good ...
too old for me . the new films are much better but thanks for having this one available for those who want the oldies .
if you love history then this is for you ! ! i love this series ! !
it is a good movie but not up to richard gere standards . story line is flat and not very interesting .
hated it it not my cup of tea i expect two girls to be getting it on and let me just say they dont
i like the movie ive seen it on tv before i wanted it the movie works good and thanks again
the dvd came in the box brand new . it plays very well . james bond movies are my favorite . this is a great movie .
i thought the movie was great ( 5 stars ) without the & # 34 ; real & # 34 ; ending . it dropped a star with the ending . it would have been great without that ending .
i purchased this dvd series for my dad who enjoys watching the reruns of the older shows . he and i watched it together and we really enjoyed it .
i would watch it again , it 's different with some great special effects i think i enjoyed the older version better but these actors more !
i bought this for her as a surprise , she loves the girls in full house , and she loved it , thank you ,
i seen this in the movies and it was really funny to me a little to long but other than that it was good .
i had heard good reviews of this movie . i was not disappointed . this movie has a great plot and wonderful acting .
a good action pack movie and as always washington was great , he is one of my favorite actors so that is it
love the show ; it is dark at times but the humor makes up for it .
great movie i wanted this one for myself . it is done so well and the music by faith hill is wonderful .
a friend of mine told me it was a good movie . i had to see for myself , and he was right . another great movie from denzel washington ! ! watch it ! !
i always want to give richard gere a chance but he rarely comes through as a great character actor or leading man , i do n't know ...
when i purchased this it was placed on my kindle fire . once again , exceptional quality , nothing wrong . even the sound is clear and crisp . excellent buy .
very enjoyable and good quality . it was nice to see the people evolve with their personalities and become more human than the machine .
a fan of classic movies , these are great for a rainy day , or during the winter when it is too cold to go outside .
i watched it today and just laughed . we used to all watch it on cable and i remember a holiday party where we went to a movie theatre and saw it on the big screen .
i happened across this and had to watch . yes , dexter has his cameo . there are some interesting insights as to why morse turned out the way he did .
cool movie , it 's one i just discovered by a random pic at my video store on vhs . watched it many times before the tape broke ...
this is a great movie i have the hole series would recomend every one to watch it
there were some hilarious parts to this movie . there were some dumb ones too . bottom line , its worth watching .
first hour was good while ann hathaway was acting after the first hour its boring , do n't waste your time on this
this is a must have movie for comedy romance viewers . it 's one that never grows old no matter how many times it 's watched .
as always there is a lot of action in all his movies . a little comedy as well always get put in too ! there is a change this time in his role you will be amazed ? ?
it 's funny , i never watched the tv show but i have seen every movie . they are all excellent including this one !
i purchased this movie as it is on of the greatest movies . i enjoy occasionally watching it . thank you much .
i had high hopes for this one as the two main characters are actors i like a lot . this movie had very few laughs and even less interest in it . avoid it and save your money .
i had this as a dvd and wanted it for my kindle fire . it is a cute movie and well worth the cost .
the series is a big joy to me and many others . we talk about it and realize it fits in our lives even now .
beautifully presented double disc set of two streisand classics . a must for all fans and lovers of movie musicals . thoroughly recommended .

i loved this , have seen it at least 3 times , above expectation . this is all i can say about this
very pleased with this dvd . this was a used set i bought and every bit as good as a new disc .
wonderful for grandparents to watch with their grandchildren . wonderful for children . the stories are just great and thought provoking for the younger generation .
this movie goes back and shows where it all started . awesome . money well spent . this movie gives you a better understanding of what happened in the past .
is exactly what i wanted a lot of extras just for fans , this kind of classic ! thank you very much
if you have n't watched this gem of a show , get to it right away . tom selleck is outstanding . watch now !
and i watch it year round ! i love this movie ! the actors are some of my favorites and the story is great !
this is a great movie to watch , so good that i watch it a second time . ready to watch for a third time .
what 's not to love about this movie ? it makes me feel good every time i watch it ... ... ...
hard to capture the life of such a fascinating and complex character in a documentary , but burns does as good a job as can be done . and he does so with balance .
love this show ! ! i got the dvds in good time . quality of dvds we good . no complaints . ca n't wait to get the next season .
great season ! one of my favorite seasons and i own the first five seasons of the andy griffith show . i recommend this season !
the fourth installment of the `` mission impossible '' series has got to be the best . the script was excellent , the special effects were superb ! this is a must see !
great movie ! well any movie with george clooney is a great movie in my book . but it has a very good story too .
all ways liked men in black movies . they have all ways been good . this one is good also . keep making them .
i have the others and this one falls in line with the rest but the ending is not what you would expect
at first i thought this was a pretty interesting series but after awhile it seemed to be just ok to just watch to pass the time away
i love this series ! ! amazon is the only place i could find all 3 in one at such a descent price !
i did n't like this at all . i guess i should have read more , i was disappointed that this movie was an adult cartoon .
what can i say , jack , jack , jack ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! sexy as usual ! good and very interesting concept for a movie , enjoyable , see it ... ... .
i went and saw this movie earlier in the day . some parts of the movie were funny , but the rest was a waste of time . please do n't spend your money on such a bad movie .
i am glad its starting a new season soon and series on dvd along with the extra stuff is really nice too
my wife and i have enjoyed all of the programs on each disc . we watch it regularly on pbs and look forward to each cd as they are available
this is truly a great gift for a star trek fan like my husband . he watches it over and over and loves how it is packaged .
great buy , great price fast delivery what more can one ask for ... love the deals for movies , it was cheaper than what i found in stores
good price and fast delivery . this is one of the dvd that keeps your interest all throughout the movie . brilliantly performed and written . bravo to the all who worked to make this movie a treasure .
really enjoyed this one , shows his history at the end of his life . story was good , enjoyed the action in the other two movies with donnie a bit better .
once again , new movie but surely a classic . old or new , watching with the grand kids on a rainy day never gets old !
i purchased two season 1 mash and both the dvd 's skip in the same spot and will not play . poor quality . i also purchased seasons 2 - 5. hope they are not a bad ! !
the movie is brilliant and the young boy cast to play in the film is a remarkable actor . i recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys first rate cinema .
i had read the book before watching it . it 's completely different story . i prefer the book instead of the movie .
a must have for dbz fans i have all 3 seasons thus far ca n't wait for the forth .
this movies is very funny and very entertaining ! it is a good way to spend free time on a friday or saturday night !
i love this movie . kids like it too . it 's funny and has a good plot to watch in family , it came very quickly and great conditions
it had some surprises . it was done from a different perspective that the original . i like most of the actors , but jennifer lawrence is my favorite . she 's already going places .
found footage of la beat cops , doing their job , living life , having romance , and fighting the bad guys . highly recommended .
this was one of my all time favorite scifi tv shows . great crew of actors and great scripts . i 'm so glad they are available on prime video .
picture quality was good but the story line was a little disjointed . wanted it to run a little closer to the tv show .
a very good science fiction movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat .
always loved the movie series and i needed to replace my copy of this title . this one was a perfect replacement since it was the 2 disc edition
it was an enjoyable movie . not great art but fun for group viewing which is how i watched it , at a family birthday party .
i am a grandmother of 3 and i love this movie ... i enjoy watching it alone and with the grandchildren ... .very entertaining ... recommend for all ages ...
movie works wonderfully and kids love it . for some reason i thought it was a four pack but it 's one dvd . picture quality is great . what kid would n't love an under water adventure .
both my husband and i enjoy watching this dvd . we enjoyed watching this series about anne 's life when it was aired on pbs some years ago .
season three is great . the color is good , good scripts , maybe a little low on the volume but you just turn it up . we have not been disappointed .
i do n't remember this order , i think it was cancelled but i am really not sure to be honest with you .
its as campy as ever . we watched two episodes the other night , and they were as good as i remembered when i was a kid .
just a classic forever . the second of bing 's priest movies . it is delightful . the movie to bring a smile whenever your down .
i think this is an interesting story and worth the entertainment value . i 'm not a ben affleck fan but i think he did pretty well in this movie .
i absolutely love this movie . saw it years ago and was excited to find it on amazon . i have watched it many times .
i watch the hobbit : unexpected journey over and over again . it takes you on a small adventure that you always seem to enjoy .
got a chance to see the end of the story , got see the whole understanding from the beginning to the end .
i really loved the movie a lot . i remember seeing the movie a long time ago . i am into historical and military movies very much .
but this xmas movie did not compare to the 1st 2 movies . but im not saying it was bad . it did have its really funny parts , trust me .
bought the whole series to enjoy it over and over again . one of the better detective shows on tv during that period of time
cute . the order vs the game is off and some scenes end differently but if you liked the game , i 'd reccomend watching this .
alice is funny and a great show for the whole family to watch . it is a show to watch with your friends as well .
you watch this and only after you see video of the original movie do you realize how good it looks .
love this series , but watching them on tv they were all out of order . so i purchased the season to see the episodes in the proper order .
this is another type john wayne movie and is good for family viewing . it will be added to my collection and watched again . thanks , bobby j .
just like any musical from this time , its long but so worth it . the music is catchy , and the actors are wonderful . a must have for any fan of musicals .
its a decent movie that made me laugh a couple times a few let down , but over all id suggest watching it . its worth getting .
this is a great movie for the entire family . it is a classic . i had forgotten how much i enjoyed the movie . i can not believe it took me this long to buy it
it is great for people who like get smart humor . i like it and i think it is great .
i loved the pilot . the airplane bringing steve home . the scenes with danny and steve . excellent the way they all came together to make a team .
this series is very entertaining . it contains happy and sad moments that keep the story going . you will find yourself guessing at what happens next ...
i have always been interested in black and white movies from the past . those were when movies were clean and funny .
just bought this for a friend , i 'm not a eddie murphy fan since beverly hills cop !
good movie and cast of actors . did not realize it contained so much magic . maggie smith roles are always worth a watch .
the whole family liked this movie . everyone liked the movie . should not have to write a set amount of words for a review !
order was recieved within a few days ( 4 ) i was shocked and happy . although , this dvd was used , it is in perfect condition . thanks for the excellent service ! !
it was an entertaining story , and all the main characters were likeable and engaging . jeff bridges was great as always .
this movie was completely different to what i thought . i honestly thought it was about a haunted house . fascinating story line that keeps you hanging on until the very end .
this is a very entertaining family movie . well worth watching more than once .
this is a great dvd and if you are a journey fan and do n't own it - buy it now .
i enjoyed watching this season as well as all the others . i just wished that they kept going . they only have 5 seasons . all ages can watch charles in charge and will enjoy it .
if you want charm , comedy , love , and mystery , this movie will provide . the characters are well developed and you root for them during the entire movie .
how can anyone not like a john wayne movie . the scenes reminded me of all the wwii movies i have seen . enjoyed this film .
i love the action from beginning to end . keeps you on the edge of your seat . out of sight . if you like action this is the movie to see .
already saw this movie at the theater , but i want to have it for my collection . so i buy it !
got this for my other half . he is into movies and music dvds of all kinds . he said this was a good movie
i would have given this movie a higher rating if it had been in color . far better than average john wayne movie .
great writing great actors . very entertaining . has a twist in the love story that i did not see coming . life lesson attitude . funny . loved it .
acting was perfect . especially katherine hepburn . always one of my favorite love stories . a classic remake of another classic love story .
it 's a gary cooper film , i should n't have to say more . it 's a silver screen classic and a must see film .
good story and characters . i enjoyed the story even though it is a little predictable . love colin firth and was surprised at the chemistry between him and helen hunt .
the only problem i have with this dvd is it wont play on my dvd player , i have the video and it is great would recommend it to anyone
good movie , enjoyed it a lot and would watch this with my kids and grandchildren , will watch this movie often .
it was great to see it again and to get the bonus material . just added to the bonus material that came with the first release of the indiana jones series i got .
the picture was about 3 & # 34 ; high by 6 & # 34 ; long so the viewing was not good . in fact i could n't finish it .
we ca n't believe we 're watching animated movies - and loving them ! the ice age series is hysterical . we 're so glad we have a granddaughter to introduce us to fun movies again !
clint eastwood at the top of his game . the movie contains lots of plot twists and ends with a great love story .
this is another very good movie . lots of action . if you like john wayne you will love this movie . i 'm a big fan of john wayne in case you have n't figured that out .
the dvd is in good condition . no scratches on the disc . the movie was as good as we remember it .
love randolph scott was a great actor and better in westerns that other movies . i only want to see him in westerns
i loved all dogs go to heaven . i loved this one too but not as much as the first . but it was still really good : )
my sister loves it , we used to watch this when it was on tv and it scared us then as now
this is one of my favorites . now i can watch it every year during the holidays . great movie and product ! thanks !
this movie did have some funny parts to it - but it really was a stupid story all in all . it was really not worth the two hours of my life i wasted on it .
my daughter loved this disney classic ! she will watch it over and over i am sure . this was a quality product at a great price ! i would recommend this product and seller to anyone .
3d version is the best ! ! ! that is what i bought . animal house of children 's movies . pg rating is deserved .
what else needs to be said . bill murray nailed it and gives me pause to wonder : is there any role murray ca n't play ?
loved the whole series . so sad it 's over ; - ( . it was a great example of what good television writing is all about ... character development .
if you like science fiction with lots of wild action this is certainly one you do n't want to miss just be ready to turn down the volume at times .
excellent movie . if you like movies that are action packed and has plenty of action this is a must see .
this movie although well done and not a sleeper left you wondering what ? ? ? at the end . not any real end that left you wondering are they just leaving the door open for another sequel ?
if you are a fan of the terminator movies , you will like terminator 3. it was clear at the end that this would be the last of the terminator flicks .
neat movie . i hated the beginning . it was boring and full of fake , bad acting . my husband said `` keep watching '' and i was glad i did . this turned into a neat thriller
i 've always been a fan of robert downey jr. he is such a great actor . he plays his part of sherlock holmes really well . it is a awesome movie .
this is my all-time , favorite halloween movie . this is high quality , exactly as described . so happy to have this in dvd format now .
great movie . good price . nice packaging . this is a classic movie and was given as a present . my son and his wife enjoyed it , although scary because it 's based on a true crime .
having found out about this series during thanksgiving , makes me want to see the entire series in it 's proper sequence .
i gave this product five stars because i really like the movie . seen it once before and had to own the movie for myself .
this one was disappointing because it looked like such an interesting idea . but it was n't executed well . it felt forced and the ending is so annoying and stupid and mostly makes no sense at all .
great storyline , if people would listen to the message it would really help them in the tough times of life .
one of the funniest movies of all time . i love these guys working together . i hope there will be a part two to this one .
the quality was not good at all . it is an okay story line . not really what i expected to get .
a friend and i watch movies together often and once in a while we find something we both love . this is a wonderful movie ... as most will agree . watch it over and over and still laugh !
this movie is great no matter how many times you see it ; doris day and rock hudson were at the top of their game . it wo n't disappoint .
this was a edge of your seat , i ca n't believe how crazy she is movie . i would recommend watching this one .
tom hanks does n't usually disappoint and he did n't here either . was a good movie about fathers and sons . would highly reccomend to anyone .
very good movie . i have alot of christian end time movies . am waiting for the left behind series to continue
this was part of the series so i figured i needed it too i have read the books and this movie is cheesy
what can i say , it 's rush - and they are so dog gone good . i can never get enough of them .
stinks in every way . do n't waste any more of your time on this movie . stop reading now and move on .
this is in my opinion a well-done love story and remember of seeing the original way back when with bogart . it '' s just as good now .
i can watch this over and over again and never get tired of watching it . i like the concept entertaining
if you have a young barbie fan , this movie should delight and entertain . typical barbie movie plot , of course , but what little child does n't want a happy ending ?
each show can stand alone , but when you watch all of them you really can understand the characters . so funny ! !
i was pleased when i found this dvd . i like having the choice between regular dvd and blue ray . this was what i wanted for a reasonable price .
a great movie in the tradition of thriller horror . prince of darkness will not disappoint you at all . i hope more horror films were filmed this way , good acting and a great story .
it was as good on my kindle as the big screen maybe better because i noticed more on the screen because being smaller with a better field of view .
this is a different take than & # 34 ; in cold blood , & # 34 ; but i preferred this movie and thought this was daniel craig 's best role .
the plot was ok , the acting was very good , but i guess i was hoping for something that never came to me . crowe has done better movies .
this is another of my favorite old time movies , i love them together , i wish they would have done more movies together .
this is another great movie , it has brad pitt as one of the actors in it , that is why , i highly recommend it
i loved the show . now i 'm waiting for season 4 to drop in price . i have season three and loved that one too .
we really love this movie and the kids really enjoy it . love the singing and fun that the penguins have and how cute the are .
it was okay . not as good as i expected , but not horrible . . . . . . . . . .
definitely one of tom hanks best movies ever . it 's definitely worth re-watching . also makes a good christmas gift for anyone who loves historical dramas .
we enjoy almost any bbc series . this take place during wwii . very good . have watched it at least three times .
this is a great suspensful movie and very good acting . i recommend this to anyone . i have seen it a few times how and love watching it .
i bought this as a gift for my sister . we watched this movie nonstop when we were younger . odd story line ; no other really know characters other than charlie sheen . delivered promptly .
i have always loved this movie and was excited to see it in 3d ! it is a great family movie . the 3d was excellent and made the movie fun to watch again .
this is the kind of movie once you have seen it no need to see it again , you will enjoy the movie not much action
good action , not sure it follows the book , but decent movie to watch . scenery and location are worth seeing alone .
this one of the greatest shows of the 21 century . i hope it will bring more great episodes for years to come .
quirky and yet really funny ! well developed characters and exceptional writers . ca n't wait for the next season !
my only issue was the series is now over , i will miss it very much .
did this movie make any sense whatsoever to anybody who had not already read the books ? did this movie fail to disappoint anybody who had read the books ?
saw this for the first time when it was out in the theatres back in the 70 's . glad i ordered it for my collection .
i ordered this as a gift for a friend & she just loved it ! great product & service ! thanks !
i even enjoy watching it from time to time ... catching myself get into it when my sons got it on in his room ... .
one of the best movies i have ever seen , too bad we dont make movies like this in the usa . you cant go wrong on this one .
cute movie i actually wish it had lasted a little longer . great acting . not exactly what i expected but worth the watch .
this was an excellent movie ! kept me wondering who , what , when and where ... .i 'll watch it again , and recommend it highly !
this is a classic ! miles ahead of the disney version . and a heroine for the ages . this should be in every collector 's library . charming .
i know i am too old to really like this movie as much as i do ... but there is something about it .
great flick . story really holds you as well as the comedy making you laugh . it 's fun for the whole family .
it does n't get any better than this , ca n't wait for the next season . this is what entertainment is all about . great job !
this is a great compilation of three excellent animated features . good for the new generation or for adults looking to revisit childhood magic . definitely a good buy !
this is one of my christmas tradition . i watched these movies every time during the holiday season . i love them and i am very happy that i was able to find them all in one combo pack .
this was just a stupid idea for a film ! no talent actors and actresses , lame storyline , ridiculous `` scares '' . this movie is so bad it 's funny ! rent it and laugh for yourself !
bought at request of wife , all 4 seasons and she sat and watched every episode . what else can i say .
this was a gift to my brother , but he said it was in great shape & he 's thoroughly enjoying it .
i like these first two seasons better than the other seasons because it had a deeper meaning and better stories . i love super heroes and love the justice league . great fight scenes .
this movie is a great classic and i believe each generation of kids can relate to this movie . so , try it out ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
i love this movie the dances are great . the actors are great . and now i have all four of the movies .
it followed english history but the acting was just ok. i think the acting quality could have been better . thanks for your attention .
i love science fiction movies and enjoyed watching this one due to the incredible special effects . the story line became somewhat flat at times but the visual images kept my attention .
this box set is not as good as the last . that being said the anime itself is spot on . absolutely awesome ! ! !
a great family movie . we enjoyed watching it with our granddaughter . our original copy was damaged so we purchased this copy to replace it .
movies generally suck nowadays because its all mind control . people only watch movies to entertain themselves thats about it . t
oh , how i miss danny kaye . if you love to laugh , watch `` the inspector general . '' danny kaye could not only make us laugh , but could dance and sing as well !
omg ! i think everyone should own a copy of dirty dancing ! funny , emotional and romantic all at the same time .
history is something that should n't be forgotten and many people today do not realize how awful people can be treated right here in this country . the film was very educational and thought provoking .
i loved watching this show when it was still on cartoon network . i have only seen a few episodes of teen titans go ! honestly , this series i like a lot better than the new series .
great movie for the whole family ! i was just as excited to see it as the kids were . it was entertaining and quite funny ! !
i have trouble holding my interest , but i found this different than all the series that are out there . i did n't want it to stop
this movie was an unexpected surprise . it was a romantic comedy , but it was absolutely hilarious at times . i enjoyed it .
hilarious movie ; if you are an adult who likes comedy movie with a touch of human values and emotions you would love this movie .
this is one of the best concerts i 've seen on dvd . these guys are amazing performers , and they love what they do . the video and sound quality are flawless .
if your starting a collection of film noir or just want to watch some good writing on film catch this collection .
i enjoyed watching every episode . i do wish that certain characters stayed a little longer but all in all it was a great experience .
this movie is so boring , i almost feel asleep . anyways this movie is about a hobbit who has to stop a random dragon for some reason ( they never tell you why ) . not good at all
i liked this movie very much . it was interesting and i will by more from this producer in the future .
well , this movie sounded like something i would like to watch , but i am not into reading sub titles . so i shut it off .
we loved this series . relaxing and enjoyable ! we love the history and the beautiful scenery and a glimpse in the life of past times .
i , m glad i watched simply because it gets added to that collection . it was mediocre at best and if you 're not a horror movie fanatic i could n't recommend this .
this is one of my favorite movies . the players are fantastic . i love , love this movie ! i have bought one for home & travel .
best show on television . i highly recommend the show to everyone who has not seen it . brilliant acting , cinematography , costumes , storylines , etc .
please see my other reviews of this series it is well worth the purchase if you are into this sort of thing .
watched it because some friends said it was pretty good ... .but really not my type of movie . glad i did ! i loved it !
they really did a great job in making this flick , very suspenseful , keeps you on edge , all the actors did a great job with their parts simply awesome
the books were just brilliant . the film was , well ... average . it just did n't do the books the justice they deserved . but , for what it was , it was an enjoyable enough film .
dc does it once again in the animated movie department . honestly it 's worth it for the fight scene at the end alone much less all the other cool stuff in the movie .
a legend told once again . i think this story real . tells the story of the man . not just the famous gun fight .
great mini series i enjoyed this one . though if your looking for the romantic titanic it 's not that . this is more serious and dry think downton abbey on the water .
awesome and thrilling movie to watch . jason statham out did himself in this movie . i highly recommend it for anybody who love action .
i laughed throughout the entire movie ! it 's just so wrong that it 's right ! the case is hilarious and just shows why i would never travel with these guys anywhere !
they are a must ! now it 's even better without the commercials ! good , clean fun for the whole family in a box !
love this movie ! so excited to find it at this price . came in great condition very quickly . i highly recommend this dvd
loved it . maybe not for everyone but was definately different . give it a chance . it is one of those movies that you have to watch a couple times to take it all in .
i first saw this movie on netflix and fell in love with it.it 's a great twist on a classic story .
this is the best muppets anything ever made . probably one of the best christmas carol stories ever made too . great movie !
i would definitely recommend this movie to kids under the age of ten . it has a cute and heartwarming , but still funny , plot .
i watched this film over and over on tv . finally had to buy it so i could get all the action without commercials . shipped quickly and arrived in great shape , thanks !
i love this movie almost as much as my mother does and it came just in time before christmas . i am very please with my purchase
nothing happens . it just goes from nowhere to nowhere . worst movie i have seen in a long while . a waste .
we liked the film . our original copy was played out and we needed the new copy . no problems with it at all .
does anyone know why a boxed set of all the columbo episodes , including the later series , was released in the uk , but not in the u.s. ?
an excellent movie , especially since this is the original british version of the film . i highly recommend this film to anyone who loves rock n ' roll radio and the history involved . brilliant !
great product , fast delivery , i love this video and only had it on vcr tape , so i was afraid that we would love the vcr player so i purchased a dvd of it
didnt see to much difference in the unrated edition . thought i would see some funny clips not in the regular movie .
want something different from a zombie movie rather than the usual `` kill 'em all anyway you can '' type ? this is it . a funny , feel good movie about hope and love against the worst odds .
i have always loved the children of the corn movies . i watched them when i was younger and would recommend it to everyone !
good acting ... and very good up to date story line with a little mystery i recommend .
loved this movie . had rented it a while back and wanted to purchase it so i could watch it again and again .
pretty much action packed from beginning to end . thoroughly enjoyable ! ! makes you think about what the future could bring and will you be ready for it .
came in less than 3 days , was in the condition the seller said it was in , we will miss mr snipes ' movies for the next year
if you enjoyed the first series , you 'll love this continuing saga . will there be more ? this is a most entertaining program , especially if you enjoy period stories .
i missed this when it was on tv , started watching based on a good friend 's recommendation , and have thoroughly enjoyed the first season .
love it ... . if you saw season 1 ... you ca n't quit now . it just gets better and better ! the acting is great , realistic hospital scenes and just enough gore .
this was a great action movie with denzel washington and john travolta . they both played parts never seen them in before .
i will always miss the tv series , but this is a great way to relive it without the commercials , etc
a classic . we have seen the movie before , the stage presentation , and are happy to have the dvd so we can watch it again .
once again i love watching this series , and enjoyed the series ' movies that he made . i definitely recommend this dvd .
i think the trailer set the tone for the movie . the movie had some suspense , some action , but it did n't keep you on the edge of your seat . informative but kind of boring .
adults and children both will love this movie . very funny and good story . voices are perfect for each character . animation is done wonderful . defiantly worth a watch .
this is a well done set . all the movies are worth watching . if you like classic westerns , then you 'll like this set .
almost better than the first one in that you know all the characters as they go on to save the world again .
it 's a great movie . will ferrell and mark wahlberg do a great job , great humor , two hours of fun . well worth the money .
i 've watched this more than my granddaughter ! this is such a cute movie ! funny and holds a child 's ( and an adult 's ) interest !
love this series like batman it was one i grew up with so many memories . thus is the one for any superman fan
i originally saw this movie in the theater , and thoroughly enjoyed it . the dvd was just as entertaining . well worth the price .
loved this series . acting was superb and cast well . have watched it 3 times already . i recommend this to romance lovers and period lovers .
i give this move zero stars . watched it with my husband and we just could n't wait for it to be over . it was stupid , slow moving and a total waste of our time .
what can you say except this is one of the funniest shows on tv . now i can enjoy it whenever i want to .
this was a good movie . a little bit too bloody for young adults . the story line was good and keep my interest
i had the vhs and i would catch this on tv from time to time and it was one of those movies that you just like and watch everytime it came on .
very intriguing movie , great acting . you have to stay focused to keep up , but well worth it . keeps you wondering .
we were looking for a good movie to watch around halloween , although this is not halloween themed , it is a great childhood classic full of suspense for kids . easy to order . good quality
really liking the characters and their adventures in season 2. good character development and great plot twists . refreshing to not know what 's coming next . if liked season one give it try .
great movies of walt disney and will go down in the history book of movies by disney . . . .
my son enjoyed this movie very much . i did not see it myself , so it 's difficult to give a proper review .
the movie had a lovely story line and should be put on the family channel . this is recommended movie for family .
this dvd arrived in the condition advertised . i watched it and it was perfect . i 'd buy from this vendor again .
one of my favorite movies i have been waiting for on blu ray . great movie - great transfer to blu ray ! !

the movie is not for me i was helping my sister buy the movie and it arrived on time she was very happy thanks
you have to see this movie in 3d only for the clarity and depth . you will want to walk into the screen at some of the shots . they have such a realistic view .
no wonder the series ran so long . this show was terrific . wish it still could be just as it was .
i love the old classics and this one is it . this brings back a lot of childhood memories . i love it
this movie was enjoyable to watch , loved the costumes acting was good . i never saw it on the big screen but wished i had because i 'm sure it would have been really fun
okay you just have to watch all the doctor shows every made , from the last 50 years . it might take a long time but it is better than other shows out there .
i did n't order this movie and i didnt watch this , so i cant say if it was good or not
i really enjoyed the movie and recommend it to anyone interested in the entertainment industry . this movie was very uplifting and appropriate for all age groups . the actors were perfect and so was the story .
this is a great kids and family movie . i laughed more times than i ever imagined i would . i had to watch it again just to see what i missed when i was laughing ! !
it is no wonder that robert duvall won an award for this one . it is especially good if you like country music but it is a powerful film at all levels .
this was a great movie . i 'd watch it again if i owned it . i 'd like to see the special features on the blu - ray edition .
this was a predictable plot but well acted ... though a little ridiculous ... .the country was gorgeous . did kevin kline do a brilliant job of speaking french badly or does he really speak french ...
i ordered this movie for someone else and they said they liked it very much and was glad that i had ordered it for them .
definitely one of the best seasons of this show ! i could n't stop watching & i got other people hooked on this show as well ( :
i love the characters and their interactions . each brings a certain element to the show . writing is good and so is the acting .
i do n't usually watch movies more than once , but i ended up buying this one and enjoy it each time .
if you like holocaust movies you will enjoy this one . i can watch it over and over and never get tired . its just one of those movies you enjoy !
season after season after season , this show just gets better and better and better . i can only hope it last at least another three seasons ! ! !
crazy story that just makes you laugh . christopher walken is always good and his characters always colorful . where do people come up with these of the wall scripts ?
fast service , good price , my granddaughter loves horses she 'll enjoy clean good programming , this is good for all ages alike
this is one of those movies from way back when that while not up to our cgi of today is still fun to see and a family film . so for blast from the past buy this film and enjoy
i discovered that i had the second movie but not the first so i ordered it out . it came promptly and was in great condition .
i 'm always glad to see a movie with hanks in it . story is about a little boy coming to terms with his best friend 's death ... his father . sad .
i ordered this dvd as a birthday gift for my daughter and she loved it ! she is a lover of anything english !
it 's family guy ... so of course it gets 5 stars . i have all of the disc sets so i basically get anxious for each release . and i am never disappointed .
oscar winning performance by one of my favorite actors mr. nicolas cage ! he turned drinking into an art form in this movie .
this is just so great . he has a great way of giving us the light side of men in a funny sort of way !

the kids and i love this movie . it is actually better than i thought for a 3rd movie in the series .
this actress makes a really good impression of ms. jane marple . and the stories are pleasantly depicted . the english settings add to this .

this is a great movie ! definitely worth the money . costner is great in this movie , as is the rest of the cast .
my son actually got me started watching these movies cause we both like zombie movies . i would recommend watching the first season . if you like zombie movies these are great to watch !
the show is as hilarious as i remember it . it 's just a shame that they could n't have included the missing episodes . maybe they 'll pop up some day .
i watched this movie , and i was in awe . i could n't believe how someone could come up with such a creative plot . if you love horror movies , then you ca n't miss this one .

slow , slow , slow - not what i 've come to expect from british television . looks like they 've come a long way since this series !
this was a good movie ... a little different part for aniston but she can do most anything and look good doing it .
i thought this was a terrific series and wish it did n't end so soon . too bad they did n't release the old spiderman series they had on tv a long time . worth the money to get .
the movie was funny and it has some good moral lessons for the family . the entire family enjoyed this movie
i knew it was a simple story line , but i had to get it anyway , i 'm like that . . . i still feel it was a very worthy purchase , no doubt !

i love the villain ! he is really a smart , clever , kick ass guy . who needs anyone else ! superior race yes indeed ... give me some of that blood .
i admit that i did n't watch much of this show . but what i saw was predictable with a mediocre cast . i had no interest in staying with it .
i was very pleased with season 10 and truly enjoyed how they changed the characters .
i happened upon this show by chance and i absolutely love it . i 've watched every season except for 4. waiting for that to be free . this is a must watch show .
would recommend this to everyone ! ! ! received my copy and have watched it more than once . ca n't beat a comedic love story !
the movie was great i loved every minute of it one of the best movies yet i give it a 10 across the board .
never get tired of this movie . love cher and nicholas cage ! great actors and real life issues that people can relate to !
typical steven segal action . lots of kung fu action . i love to watch in fight , but i swear he runs like a girl

intense yoga work out ! i love it because it is relaxing yet challenging at the same time . i really like this dvd . my favorite yoga ever : )
i saw this way back when i was a kid and thought it was romantic and fun - and i really enjoyed seeing it again !
more than worth the time for miller and brown , it has value also as a glimpse of another age in both life and movies .
a deep sci-fi movie ! you become part of the character , and it stays with for a while ! watched it several times !
this is a great set if you like the x-files , the set also included the 2 x-files movies this was a great bonus
because denzel is a great actor in all his movies , i just wanted to see him rock it which he did . the movie was alright
a treasure for those who went to the movies back then . clean , innocent , and happy times . theme well thought out and makes me feel young again .
not a madea , but still funny . the movie has a true family meaning with the usual hidden message . you have to laugh sometimes to keep from crying .
enjoyed this movie so much i bought the dvd . it 's an action-packed , fun , creative movie fun for animal lovers of all ages .
perfect for any true movie fan ! and if you a comic book head even better . great acting , effects , and action .
this is a very well put together movie . great story line and great acting . a must see !
very great movie enjoyed it very much , a lot of great action , very fine acting , the plot was great hope they make more movies like this one .
what a couple ? ? ? ? these two actors are always great together - loved every movies i have with them in it .
would recommend to anyone who loves a good comedy and enjoys good comedic dialogue . good character tension and entertaining plots .
without a doubt this is the best show of this genre ever done . the acting is excellent . it holds you .
the movie is amazing , the effects , the storyline and the ending . surround sound makes it even better .
alright movie ... the ending was no surprise ... you can figure out where this movie is going once the two lead stars are introduced to each other ... but okay and would tell you to watch
this classic sci-fi movie is a must have in blu-ray . it 's amazing what they can do with a movie this old . you notice details you 've never seen before .
as always amazon came through by sending another good quality dvd . i would recommend amazon highly . have n't got a bad dvd yet .
i had great memories of what a great soundtrack i thought this movie had . after purchasing it , i realize that the soundtrack was good but the sound quality is n't and the movie itself is plain bad .
i 'm a movie buff and love the old movies . this dvd was an excellent addition to my collection . great movie .
great addition to my class lesson plans . students like to view the film and compare it to the novel . great version of the high school book .
i bought this for my mom because it was on her christmas list . she absolutely loves this mini-series and therefore has been very happy with this dvd .
one of the more creative movies i 've seen this year . jay z helped produce this and there is a lot of his music on here . great flick .
if you really want to laugh and enjoy a good movie this is it . it has everything , comic situations , love , romance , ghosts , unexpected ending , and great actors .
i brought this movie because i am a fan of joan crawford , but i found this movie to be a bit corny . the acting was not as good as other joan crawford movies .
the movie was not for me , it was a gift for my husband . i rated it the way i did because it is one of my husband 's favorite movies .
each one of the short stories were interesting but the last one had the most powerful message . some of the acting was over done but not terrible .
a personal drama with an excellent message . the scenery is pretty awesome as well . was worth seeing twice , first with my wife then with my daughter .
hugh laurie at his best and a show that everyone should see , it has everything !
an interesting buy if you watched this sort of thing as a child . i got it only because it was cheap at the time .
how can you go wrong with a martin sheen movie ? the story is a good one and even if the movie is old - its worth the time to watch it
the same goes for all of the 007 collection i purchased . i see now that the cheap prices offered was for in furious products .
read the book before watching the movie . i was hooked after the first movie.it 's a great sci-fi fantasy to take your mind off of the everyday real life .
loved it ! each episode makes me laugh each time i watch . shipment came in three business days and in perfect condition ! thank you i 'm one happy happy happy person jack !
good movie to just sit and watch . just enough action to keep it going . very well picked actors and actresses .
i really enjoyed this movie - morgan freeman 's role was a surprise but very entertaining . i would recommend this move to anyone .
if you like british war movies it 's ok. ( i do ) not something i would care to watch more than once , tho ' .
these are two of the funniest 80s movies . if you 've ever had a weird neighbor or thrown money into a project , these movies are for you .
cute but not great , nothing else much to say but since there is a minimum amount of words for these reviews i 'll have to say there is nothing else to say .
i purchased this my mistake , but it was a mistake that turned out well . i liked this movie and the graphics were amazing . definitely worth adding to your library
good movie . would have preferred that it was based more on the original movie ( mars ) but it does have more action scenes and great graphics . you will enjoy it .
gave it as a gift , so i think she really liked it . i will ask her later for a review .
it has its frightening moments , if you liked the movie saw this is up your alley
was n't that good as the second one from the series . but its worth a shot .
this movie is one of the best story lines i have ever seen . this would be a great movie for the whole family .
good sci-fi movie with great special effects . i have the 3d version and it is awesome compared to the dvd version
i received this in a combo deal . the show and movie are good . this is ok. but the quality and packaging was great . i was quite satisfied with my selection from amazon .
i liked watching this second movie , in this new series , as much as i enjoyed first seeing the series opener .
this was the best start trek series . ca n't get enough of it . gave this as a gift . my dad loves them .
to bad i waited so long to get the dvd . it had become rather expensive . i saw them in a store a few months back for a more reasonable price .
it is what it is . i did n't expect much out of this movie . it did slightly out perform my low expectations .
i watch pbs on a regular basis . i love the sitcoms and i also love the british movies . there is such class in them . love these
i liked this movie . it was scary but i did catch myself laughing . overall it 's a good rainy day rental .
i liked the story and acting . a cut over most tv shows that is for sure . lets have more like it .
i could watch this one over and over . the chemistry between meryl and clint is great which makes the story so believable . a great love story to be enjoyed by a mature audience .
i hated this movie when i first saw it in theaters , but it eventually grew on me , and now it 's one of my favorite horror films . here 's hoping they make a 3rd .
i thought that the movies were very good and that they are very good for kids .
i am looking forward to season 4. i wish they would hurry up with production . this product comes well packaged and at a good price . i recommend it to everyone who enjoyed this series in the past .
i know this movie isnt on some peoples top list to watch , but for me i thought it was a great movie
this is a great , great movie . the acting is superb and the story line fascinating . i have watched it many times because i so enjoy it .
very exciting show . more drama in 24 hours than one can handle in a lifetime !
hey look , the songs are great but when i had the dvd , the sound or at least the 5.1 sucked . only for serious collectors .
i watched this movie on hbo and i thought it was very confusing and hard to follow . i still dont really understand it .
it is psych how could you say anything less then love it . arrived on time and without any damage , very pleased .
i have the entire frasier collection . the writing and character chemistry is the best . i enjoy watching this series over and over . the best of personal entertainment for the money !
well the movie lived up to it 's name ... non-stop action . clever script that will leave you guessing till the end .
the case and the dvd were in very well kept shape . it played perfect and i am pleased with my purchase . thanks !
good performance by some of our times greatest actresses . funny and heart warming while at the same time a little sad .
i loved every season of this show ! thank u for deliver this show to me on time ! love the whole cast ! i recommend this to family and friends
love this movie . i had heard poor reviews but i do n't understand it , i enjoyed this and was ready for the second installment
i wish it could have been picked up by another station . this was an amazing group with an awesome set of writers . seriously , the good shows are being replaced with crap .
a good movie that will keep you in your seat but not a major award winner . this is n't a movie for everyone .
i loved all the new episodes . i watched every episode and i will continue to buy each season that becomes available . the case is broken
this was a thoroughly enjoyable movie . i love movies and it is very hard to find decent ones these days .
of course the previews look cute but it was a silly , long movie glad i did n't buy the dvd for the full price
again we are so happy to be able to buy this on amazon because it was always sold out in stores in our area !
it was a very entertaining movie . when it started i thought i was going to be disappointed , but i was glad i watched it .
my daughter is a collector of lucy shows . myself watched her shows too , was very funny but gives pleasure watching movie .
steven 's dry delivery and forward thinking is so very funny ; he gets me every time . this dvd is worth the watch !
always thought this was one , if not the best , science fiction movies ever made . this should be in your collection if you want to watch sci-fi .
i enjoy all the movie that i order i have not seen it yet but i no that i , m going to enjoy watching when i make time you no i love all my movie
i 've enjoyed watching this movie several times . i believe it 's a wonderful story and the actors are excellent with their performance .
i love this film ! this is by far one of my favorite classic films . how could it not be , with such a great cast ?
you just ca n't beat the old classics and this is one of them ! i would recommend it to anyone who would like to spend time watching a classic
this is as funny today as it was years ago . good views great comedy . would recommend this dvd . the sequel was not as good as the first but still funny .
i really enjoyed the performances . the singing was very good . it featured some of my favorite actors that i have n't seen in a while ...
this is one of the classic old tv shows that i really enjoyed back the in my younger years . today these type of shows do not exist .
this is a beautifully written and thought provoking move - this would be enjoyed by all age groups . you wo n't be disappointed .
combo comes with good extras and movie itself is quite entertaining . it 's nice to have in your collection for those days you need to laugh and relax .
bought this to complete my set of murder she wrote tapes . just what i wanted . saw probably all of them on tv , but wanted my own to keep . great .
have n't watched yet ! tommy lee jones is one of my favorites ! i think my hubby ordered this movie , i will watch in the future !
this video may appeal to those who enjoy historical documentaries . i was looking for something a little different than this .
i waited for this to be at a reasonable price , leave it to amazon to get a good deal ! it will be added to my grand babies disney classic collections
it was a great movie especially if you love action movies you will like this one a lot , going to get 2 .
been waiting for part 1 and 2 of the final act to come out for a while . great anime . dvd was delivered quickly and in good condition . good subtitles .
the pilot was way to gory , way to fast , lost it for us ! wow not a family show at all !
this was one of the best movies of it 's time . great story line , good acting and one of denzel 's first . the cast was excellent .
we enjoyed it as much this year as in previous years . a good movie to enjoy with friends and family .
this show certainly has it violence and drama and never stops . i like it but realize it would not be for everyone
i was thinking it was going to be like saw , it was different but it did make me think
i love this movie good movie for anyone who loves these kind of movies great beach scenes in it too
this many awesome movies in one set , how could you go wrong ? i bet you ca n't watch them all in one day !
this movie makes me laugh every time i watch it . very funny , great movie to own . buy this movie now
this movie is in my top ten . when i want to watch a movie but do n't know what i want to watch i 'll see this in my collection and will not have to look any longer .
the movie was entertaining and tommy lee jones was great , but ashley judd 's performance was a little lacking . i would not watch this movie again .
the writers are fantastic . the transformation of the original to todays 's sherlock is terrific to watch . i have every film back to the beginning and some are disappointing but this is truly worth your time .
thank you this is a really great movie and the condition of the dvd was in really good shape , thank you
this is one of the best series ever . think i have all of them now . i hope they continue him in the p d james books .
the bonus features were an exciting look into the new way this musical was made . i watched and learned so much more about the movie , actors and people involved in making this .
just what i expected in great quality . recommended to all action fans buy it you wo n't be disappointed especially at its new low price .
a great storyline and good acting makes this movie worth the time to view it . as a matter of fact i watched it more than once . no problems with this purchase .
great show , love that is is available for free for prime members . at times it can be a little slow but there are enough unexpected twists to keep you watching .
i love all doris roberts movies . this is a great movie , would recomend mrs. miracle to anyone . it 's a great family movie .
i love the women in this movie , they are a great combination of actresses . i love the revenge factor in this movie .
tom cruise is such a good actor . this is full of action and adventure and a great story line , too . it does n't have disgusting language either .
a great movie worth its price . i can watch this movie more than once . would love to see more romantic movies like this one . i felt in love with all the characters .
if you are looking for a romantic movie that is light and fun , this is a good one . very cute .
this movie is awesome i love it if you like comedy you will like this i know for me it is awesome i would recommend it
we had not seen this movie for over ten years but we watched last night and we enjoyed it . i do not think it will be 10 years before we watch it again .
i own the movie set so this was perfect addition . i love the story and how it keeps the saga going great cast and tender love story
enjoyed it from beginning to end , great stuff . had really good action and fx with great funny moments . 2 thumbs up .
once again johnny depp is good ! ! movie a little slow at first . but enjoyable . the humor was great . and you cant forget the lone ranger theme ! ! ! that made the movie .
i bought this dvd , because i have n't seen the original star wars since it came out in the theaters 30 years ago . it was great to see it again .
little to no extras . this great film deserves better treatment than this . we can always hope .
is n't the same as ny 's - you know how to spell it ! i do n't think any of them are as smart as they are made out
this show is so hard to get in dvd format ... in any format so if you can find it , grab it ! kevin james is hilarious and has a clean show .
it was ok ... thought it would b alot more action packed as most of his movies r so that is why i am disappointment more then finding it terrific .
what a wonderful and timeless movie with such a great cast . this movie is a new classic in my book .
just buy it . it 's a quality sitcom that stands the test of time . you ca n't go wrong with this entire series .
we loved this cartoon movie . my husband does not like cartoon movies but he did like this one . it is funny and cute .
this is a great series . probably one of the best out there along with oz , sex and the city , and game of thrones .
great story , excellent acting , good direction , produced by clint eastwood , who never makes bad pictures . a movie that is well worth watching .
i was very surprised that i 've enjoyed watching the reruns of this star trek spin off as much as i have .
this movie did n't hold my girls attention as well as the newest care bears movie so i would n't really recommend it .
my husband loves this show and is enjoying is on our kindle . once he is done , i will begin watching it .
great series - would highly recommend to any child of the 90 's ! entertaining and hilarious are the best words to describe it !
it was fun for a family night night but i did n't think it was as good as 1 or 2. kids will stay entertained .
anything with statham i 'll watch but this was one of his earlier movies and you could tell it was kind of a & # 34 ; b & # 34 ; movie , but it was watchable .
whether you prefer dramas or action , this movie should do it . love , family , hunting , murder , etc . i would watch it again .
great for the 5th time and after all these years . like that they are able to follow characters thru the the whole war
i absolutely loved the movie . it 's a movie that would be good for kids & adults . the animation is awesome .
i liked it , it was the better of the two movies of the same name and great movie for the whole family
i enjoyed the love story and the unusual characters . it was well played and enjoyed the actors and actresses they picked .
i would say that she is the main reason that i gave a 4 stars . i forgot snow white 's name , but i think she still has some space to improve in terms of acting skills .
i did n't think i would like this at first . now it 's one of my all time favs . imagination was brought to life in brave
an interesting , true story with many actors doing a good job of portraying the soldiers saving valuable art during ww ii .
a very moving performance of the famous story ! ! excellent voices and good acting - memorable scenes and beautiful music . a must for opera fans !
love the series ! ! ! can not wait for season 6 to come out ( hopefully ) ! ! : ) the product came in wonderful shape and earlier than the actual shipped date ... no complaints !
i love eddie murphy this is one of the best show he ever did i had to have this dvd .
very good - edge of your seat type . good entertainment . people told me it was scarey so i was expecting a horror movie - which it was not - but i liked it
watch the movie with my family during this week & everyone liked it . will check the internet for more movies .
i saw breaking dawn 2 in the theaters and could n't avoid purchasing the movie in the end . now i have the complete set and will be able to enjoy anytime !
its not what it use to be , i think they are trying to kill the show on purpose after killing it and bringing it back .
i enjoyed this movie . the characters were fun and several parts had me laughing out loud . this is one of my go to and re-watch movies .
this is an excellent movie that i will watch over and over again . great cast and good story line .
the show was ok lots of action . i think you love it if you love model airplane you will this movie .
very interesting movie because i kept thinking that i would know what would happen next and i was wrong every time . it was definitely a powerful movie that made me think about my value system .
this film was suggested to me and i really loved it . it has great teaching moments and a breath of fresh air .
a great show , the concept and plot was very good , it is only a pity that it never took off . we did not even get it here in australia that i know of .
great cast , quite different from anything else i have seen ! i liked the ending and the fact that they had all become friends !
a lot of times the second or third can never live up to the original . this is n't one of those . both 1 & 2 are great .
i would n't waste my money on this had i known it would be so stupid , tatum channing is good looking , but this movie is n't his best move
love this movie and had a great time watching it with my family . my children watch it again and again .
i got this for my dad - he really liked john garfield - i saw this also and it is one of his best .
good old tv series back when the whole family could watch and i say i wish we could bring back that country i was a child in .
amazon has yet to ever disappoint me and i have purchased from them for many years . this is to place to go .
good show but the most important thing : horrible packaging ! ! please go back to the old way !
van damme what else do you need both great movies just the best for all us fans of van damme work i think these are two of his best works
i love this series so much and was sad to see it only had two seasons , i want them to release the rest
what can i saw about this that has not already been said . one of the better movies from the sixties . good acting through out and no surprises .
great movie saw it when i was 12 , its was great back then and its just as great now !
one of clint eastwood 's better movies . i 've watched it several times and have enjoyed it each and every time . no critic here , just one man 's opinion ... it is a great movie .
this is a great old movie that is based on a true story . a must have for any world war ii fan .
kept you interested in the next scene , stayed true to the plot . worth watching again just to see costumes an d colors
i thought it was a great film . i really like the animation style , my kids liked the movie a lot and it kept them very interested .
i got this set for a great price and very good condition and we watch them over and over again .
i like it a lot it has some good suspense to it . i might be able to figure out plot , but still like it .
we read the play in class using the no fear shakespeare version . i then showed the students this movie . they loved it .
love this animated movie . it will be a classic i 'm sure . ca n't wait to see it one day in 3d .
i bought this movie for my mom at christmas time too . she loves the movies of this actress .
i was rather disappointed in this movie . i love dvd and movies that are in this period . i always watch the movie twice before i have a strong opinion on it
great movies to share with the family . need more of the american girls to watch with the grand children . loved them all .
we purchased and received the dvd i am legend on time in new condition . this dvd is a wonderful addition to our library dvd collection . thank you so much
one of my favorite wayne films . no one did a western like he did . i try to add to my collection every so often .
i liked the movie way back when and was excited to see it on dvd . totally 80 's movie but i still like it
excellent mystery . it really keeps you thinking . i look forward to seeing season two .
to much cussing , and inappropriate ... did not even get through five minutes of the movie , and i had to turn it off ...
i bought this for my granddaughter . she was really pleased to get it and i was really pleased with the low price .
the acting was so bad that i could n't finish it . yes , there was a lot of action of that 's all you want this might work for you .
i gave it this rating as it was great to watch as you never knew what was going to happen . it would have used a bit move action .
the acting is over the top , but pretty usual for that era and subject content . typical teen movie ( not so much now ) , but it sure was great back then !
now i can see this every night and every i can . judy is a great actress with an outstanding voice
good movie with a good story . for once , i liked julia roberts , but i feel the rest of the cast made the movie . i enjoyed it very much .
not done yet but it gets very interesting . now i do not miss any episodes anymore some of them are kind of silly but i do not miss .
we loved this one . i highly recommend it . it will leave you smiling and feeling good . a great date movie . will smith is awesome ! !
i highly recomend this movie . it was very interesting . i still ca n't figure out if this guy is blind or not .
the movie was good not only for myself but for my grandchildren as well . i have recomended it and will continue to do so thanks
great movie for the family . learn the value of free speech in america , but also that there must be christ 's love portrayed in our lives ! a little girl teaches everyone a lesson ! !
this is an interesting sci-fi animation . great for both kids and adults . has a new twist on alien invasion . not predictable !
have been doing this workout since it came out years ago . it 's like dancing and it 's fun . just wish it was on dvd .
michael j. fox did a fantastic job in this movie . it arrived on time and in great condition . i love the music too !
i did not watch the first one and was still able to follow it for the most part but it might have been more enjoyable if i knew the back story .
i found this movie extremely boring . it felt like nothing ever happened . i ended up turning it off . not at all what i expected from a sci-fi tom cruise movie .
i have not watch this my daughter said it was real good , wish i could tell you more , i do not watch many cartoons .
broadway - i love it . the music is great . the production is done beautifully . the colors are outstanding . very enjoyable .
robot and frank is a really good movie . watching it will make you appreciate your friends and family a little more .
any football sports fan would find this movie enjoyable . it is a faith based movie that can be used with all ages . great movie for the price and good to add to a collection .
how can it be any better or worse than 5 for columbo . excellent videos and very entertaining . love to have friends over for this
this would have recieved a 5 star if it had subtitles . i enjoy the movie , but i need subtitles . if you dont need them , feel free to buy and be entertained .
but the 1 joke seemed to never end and there 's gon na be a sequel so will add it to collection as well
probably albert brooks best writing and acting . of course meryl streep was very good and beautiful . it 's nice that a good movie never gets old .
seriously ... what was this ? i think the kids have to be older to enjoy this . no one liked it in our house . not even laughable . just ... bad .
there is no doubt to own this dvd . both actors are so good and funny . they are picking the right person for this show . very funny , sometimes .
this dvd was received in a timely manner . i am very happy with it .
this movie was pretty entertaining but not one of the best with these two actors . i would definitely watch again though .
one of the best syfy movies ever made , jodie foster and james woods totally makes this movie , i 'm glad i finally got to see it
another good movie in the men series . the movie was packed with action and suspense . i did enjoy the story and overall movie
i love this movie it is tense and the acting is good . nicole kidman does a great job making us feel for her .
i really enjoyed this movie . it went so well with the & # 34 ; love & # 34 ; series . i especially liked st. nick and the snow .
we have & # 34 ; let it ride & # 34 ; in vhs so obviously of no use anymore . i plan to buy the dvd . we absolutely love it . so funny .
i really loved this movie . the twist they threw in at the last was great . i really was n't expecting that .
it is a children 's movie after all . i had forgotten what a dumb story it was . by today 's standards too much singing and dancing .
came in its original box . very nice , no scratches . great movie . good for the holidays or when you need a bill murray classic .
i love the series , very entertaining , got it at a great price , would recommend it to anyone . waiting to get season 5 .
you have to listen carefully , as there are several turns in this movie , that keep it exciting . well worth watching
action , intrigue , twists and turns . everything a good spy film needs . if you like the mi movies you will like this one as well . another great episode of spy adventure .
awesome transfer to a great movie . definitely worth the dvd to blu upgrade . the picture and sound has never looked so good .
facing the giants , all i can say is you must get this movie . takes you back to high school , and college ball . and it will make you think about things you should think about .
great movie , she 's growing up to be a really good actress . the movie came really fast , thanks !
very funny , dirty jokes , but i watched 10 times and they do n't get old ! ! ! santa is bad as it can be ! ! ! some lines you wo n't forget ! ! !
i love nicholas cage as an actor and he does good work in all of his movies , this movie was humorous as well !
this was a wonderful movie . i think it was one of gregory peck 's first movies . i loved the story line and the class of the actors .
this movie is magical and fun . it is great for the whole . family too enjoy . this is the second movie . be sure and watch them in order .
we have enjoyed this season as much as the last three so far . we are only about half way through it , but it is laugh out loud funny most episodes .
one of my husbands favorites . my dad watched war films . i 'm not into this . but if you love war flicks then this is one for you .
i thought it was a terrible movie . i ca n't believe i actually wasted my time ! ! the plot was terrible and it could have been better . bottom line is do not waste your time !
good plots and many surprises . can be watched with family and grown up kids . needed more reality stories and that will make it perfect
the previous 3 movies were excellent - this one was poorly done , i wasted my money - rent it if you can .
this dvd was shipped in a timely manner , good condition . i like this movie and i would recommend the seller again .
i love having added this to my collection ! it 's very good . if you like horror then i recommend this one !
it really is different , not what you would expect but very well written , comical , has action and great lesson , overall very good .
story line is decent . but the movie starts out slow . you need to stick with it in the beginning . then it pick ups and becomes more entertaining .
this movie has some of the most spectacular scenery . the story was captivating and the characters were strong . if you like musicals you will absolutely love this movie .
i really love this show . love the fact i can purchase it and watch on my kindle ! ! ! hope the seasons keep on coming .
this one is a fun watch . it is n't great cinema , but who cares ?
my husband really liked this series as for me not so much . i 'm not into war shows . my husband would recommend it highly . happy watching
a great sequel to the first one . so nice to have no swearing , no sex , and yet a good movie .
i love this series and i love james garner . this is a great series with wonderful car chases and surprises ... .
i just finished watching this and although i saw this movie when it was first shown on tv , it is still a great movie to watch .
this movie is right down funny -- if i would like it , anyone would -- robin williams plays the right part , owen wilson is also funny in this movie
johnny depp has done better . could be the theme of the movie , but it was mildly comical and somewhat boring at times .
nice action packed movie with lots of twist and turns it was a great story line too you should watch if your into action movies
it kept my interest and being the second in the series , i know that there is much more to come .
i have n't watched this movie in years . it has definitely stood the test of time . great casting too . fonda is amazing !
what a great show ! i highly recommend the complete series . it is laugh out loud entertainment for all !
i purchased this season for a christmas gift . it was priced very well and will be much enjoyed . arrived promptly .
this is an excellent movie ! i would recommend it to anyone . the actors did a great job and there was a lot of action in the movie .
keeps the children and grand children busy . very good story . would recommend to anyone looking for some good family entertainment .
this movie is a time killer , not an enjoyable experience . the first one was better . the cheese in this one is too much to handle .
the color was poor and the acting left a lot to be desired . i am sorry i purchased this movie . i am a big fan of tom selleck too .
this show is the best and i love to watch it all the time that it is on tv everyday
only got this movie because it had close caption . it was okay but to me .
bought for a gift and my husband loves this movie . it is great that gives you an option of digital copy so you can watch it on ipad or computer when traveling .
this dvd is filled with some of the great up and coming stars of the 1980 's . tom cruise is great !
just love horror films . starting a tradition where i buy at least one horror film in october from now on .
not a bad movie , it just did n't grab me . plenty of stars , acting was n't bad , writing was n't bad , i just did n't feel involved in the story .
very good writing - could n't stop watching it . ca n't wait to watch the next 2 seasons . would love to visit london .
this is a cute movie , and i recommend it to anyone who had small children and want a fun movie that is n't scary .
i could not stop watching this series until it ended ! it is fantastic , historical , interesting and entertaining ! i highly recommend it to anyone who likes this genre of films .
each episode sets up a unique problem for the team and there is lots of heart put into the program . very good work .
dean martin and all of the others is these films make them all worthwhile . i have a friend who is in it as a favor to dean and that made it even better .
this was a fun movie for the whole family . definitely one to keep . it has only one toy which all kids want to be aware .
i found it entertaining and suspenseful . some of the scenes could have been done better but overall i enjoyed it .
i already forgot what it was about . so that may tell you something . i do n't have the seven more required words .
each season just seems to get better than the last . i am really looking forward to watching season 5. thanks
i now have the entire series . it is the best series yet ! i ca n't think of another series that has gone ten seasons and two movies .
i was pleased to receive the dvd 's so promptly . both are like new and the price was very reasonable .
i like certain john wayne movies , and this is one of them . while this is n't really what you would call a christmas movie - it does take place over christmas time in hawaii .
i was a very excellent product , i like this movie , to everyone who likes this kind of movie , very good product .
i had this dvd already , but i guess i wore it out i watched it so much ! had to order another copy . ca n't beat the price . so worth it .
it is a great series but often hard to understand what is being said due to accents but it has suspense , drama , a bit of comedy and strong violence
this was always a fun tv series . just wanted to experience it again . for old or young this is a fun series
i can not believe that my kids liked this ! some of the parts were extraordinary and then some were like is this the same movie ?
this was so i had something at the house for my granddaughter and since she does n't get to come very often we have not watched it yet
thought this was your typical scary movie . it has a different twist and it takes it to another level sci fi unrealistic events . strange movie but not the worst i 've seen .
i chose 5 stars because this is the best show i have watched in a long time . i think they have a great cast of actors that work very well together .
this flick is super funny and very family friendly . i would recommend for kids and adults . we love this movie .
love clint eastwood . amy adams is great as well . i would recommend this . i highly recommend this movie . fast delivery too .
this is a good musical . it has great music and actors who can really act !
i ordered this as a gift and decided to keep it . another great old school movie , it a must have to add to your collection item . quick shipping and nice picture quality .
it does n't get any better . sherlock holmes on blu ray for basil rathbone fans . fantastic
this is one of my favorite scary movies . i liked the story line and wish they would make a sequel to it . very reasonably priced with quick delivery .
another tim allen classic . this film has the perfect mix of funny , sad , and serious . a great film for all ages .
it is a nice movie with a great message . i wish the acting and directing would have been better , but the message is solid .
this is a great movie . i watched it on television and bought it to have in our collection . it has a great story line and is very good .
this series is much better than the previous one [ # 1 ] . the storylines are more dramatic and the acting is excellent
this is one for the your classic collection . loads of laughs throughout the entire movie . this has to be one bill murray 's best .
a wonderful , nostalgic look at this history of american music . i enjoyed it thoroughly and can watch it over and over again .
i loved this when i was growing up and i was so happy to find it so i can now share it with my granddaughter -- who loves it as well .
i love this one . i did not like the prior actor in the last spider man movies . i would recommend .
if you like to laugh and like scary movies this one is for you . the best scene is any scene with charlie sheen . he is a comic genius
this film is full of action and filmed well , great plot and full of well done cgi . i you want excitement watch this film .
what is to be said about a classic like this other than it stands the test of time , all great films do : - )
great for any jet li fan . pure action yet funny too . i had this on vhs so i decided to get it on dvd .
this tv series was only on two seasons . but i liked it a lot . glad to get to add to my video collection . would recommend .
i 'm certainly glad i bought this because the extended version ca n't be rented anywhere . this movie is a musical , a tragedy , a comedy , and a bit of a masterpiece .
i really enjoyed watching madea 's neighbors from hell and madea - is always laugh out loud funny ! my 9 year old daughter loved it .
i watched this movie a long time ago , i loved then and i love it now . the writing on the box my be chinese by not the movie !
i do n't particularly care for all the sequels in the land before time series . some stand out , both the story and the music . this is a good one , i liked it !
my grandson just loves to watch underdog do his stuff , and he learns alot from this movie . like dogs do n't really fly and have the strength that underdog has . great movie !
i was really looking forward to seeing this movie then when watching it . i was truly disappointed with this movie
i love that they are all playing themselves ! everyone in this movie has a classic line ! this is great for anyone who likes anything they have been in !
i have viewed each one of the trilogy i would recommend this to anyone it kept me interested all the way through
this movie is a great drama that teaches us to be ourselves and that each of us is beautiful in our own way .
if you liked this series on tv , my husband loved it , he use to watch it with his dad , so brought back great memories for him and a great price
i remember going to see this movie with my mom and brother as a kid . it really brings back terrific memories . it was always my brother 's and my favorite !
my mom absolutely loves the movie gone with the wind and absolutely had to have it on dvd so she could watch it whenever she wanted to . she has really enjoyed this dvd .
bought season 1 & 2 as the tv series were very entertaining back in the 60 's wish they were like that now are more seasons going to be released very very entertaining . recommend the series loved it
i am in the forth season , and if you like this type movie , then the unit is a must to watch .
i thought this was going to be a fun movie with interesting interaction between bruce willis and bill murray , instead it turned out to be a movie on badly raised children doing stupid dangerous things .
i found this in the garbage . i watched 10 minutes . i threw it back in the trash .
this is a great series . my wife and i have watched every episode . much better the morse which was boring .
fun to watch - adult humor throughout . i can remember seeing this as a child , and as i watch as an adult , there is a whole level of humor and wit that i missed years ago .
typical x-files adventures . i like this series better than any of the & # 34 ; reality & # 34 ; shows on tv now . recommended for any x-files buffs .
great family movie full of fun , adventure , and outstanding 3d ! visual experience is great as well as the fun storyline with fantastic effects !
a worthy sequel to the original with some added characters that enhanced the series . robert downey plays the main character with just the right amount of dry humor .
i ordered this for some else as well . they watched the dvd and was very happy with the quality of it . thanks for the prompt service .
not at all what i expected with all the hype around this movie ... .. the story line is pretty thin ... ...
i liked the first movie , but i honestly think this 2nd movie is better . it moved really fast and kept my attention . close enough to the book to make me happy .
this movie really moved me . made me sad , smile , appreciate what i have & love . everyone should see this . it was in excellent condition & arrived when promised .
love , love , love it ! i 'm totally addicted to this show ! it will be one long summer as we wait for it 's return !
always like these movies i have all of these movies they have action adventure and lots of zombies also cool special effects .
this is an excellent movie . sally field once again demonstrates what a great actress she is . i recommend it !
this is my favorite movie . i never get tired of watching it . the movie arrived on time and works great . i would make another purchase from this seller .
i believe she now has a spongebob for every season of the year and every holiday . they are wonderful books and great quality . thank you
how do you rate perfection , you do n't you just watch and listen . it was worth adding to my collection . wish they would do another project together .
this is an amazing piece of military history . read it over and over . by the way , the movie did n't even tell half the story .
because there were so many jokes and sight gags that went by so quickly , i 'd definitely watch again and maybe again .
i always enjoyed the original movie as a kid . jim carey really made this movie remarkable . a great family christmas movie .
as a fan of 1950 - 60 ` s horror movies i really enjoyed seeing this one again . the best science fiction and horror movies were filmed in black and white .
i love everything about this movie . great acting . great story line . it is written so well . i am so glad to have my own copy of it .
i hope there is a season 2. very interesting stories they are addicting . i will definitely look for a season 2 and beyond !
it was okay i watched all of it and hoped for the happy ending it had . the supporting people were good .
at first the kids did not want to watch this but once the show was on they could n't get enough .
i will not sit alone and watch this tape again , there is just no way form or person can make me it was wonderfull
let 's face it , there is n't a series that lives up to this one ! ! love it and will watch it many more times ! ! !
very prompt ! got it just before i needed it . i now have the series ! love it ; love it ; love it ; love it !
this is fun ! just be sure not to have too small of kids around , as some of the subjects are for adults only .
this is a great comedy . i 'd watch it again and i 'm sure enjoy it over over again . really cute , recommend this movie .
the simpsons are funny . the product was cheap and it came in great time . i did n't have to wait long at all .
very good movie from disney . watched this when i was younger and is still a classic . a lot of big name actors as well .
the trailers for this this movie ( and many others ) should have been the ones to win anything ( if there was something to win ) .
i love the period clothing but did n't know it was a musical . i thought this film would 've been more dramatic and with suspense . i was bored with it and finish watching the movie .
deeper character development and more complicated situations makes this the best season of s & amp ; c ... do n't miss it !
so glad i was able to purchase a combo pack of these two great movies ! one of the best purchases i have ever made !
finished up my collection so far of the movies , and worked great . arrived in timely fashion . was wrapped and new . no scratches .
this movie is great and fun and i doubt it would happen in real life but it is hilarious ! i recommend it .
this film has something for everyone . great music , great story line , funny scenes . we 've watched it several times and love it every time .
i was surprised at how good this movie was because as part was way different then his past roles , but he did great !
nothing but fantastic . this movie has got to be on the top seller list . the color is great and the transfer to bluray is great .
to those of you who like it , more power to ya . i found it just silly ... i actually fell asleep during it .
it is just as funny as the first season , these four ladies together are so incredible i wish it was on longer .
very is a funny program -- i use to watch it on tv when i was a kid
katherine hepburn and humphrey bogart work a wonderful chemistry under less than ideal conditions . real star quality acting that stands the test of time .
this movie makes fun of all other movies about teens and kids in high school . it 's funny . if you like making fun of stuff you 'll love this .
this was a very clever movie and you had no idea what was going to happen . the two lead actors did a great job . watch this one . you will be pleased .
i did not get to see this tour when it was going on . if you like journey you will really like this it is a really good concert .
words can not describe how terrible this movie is , it made absolutely no sense at all . bad acting , bad story line just pathetic , that 's all i have to say .
delightful , engaging , suspenseful , hilarious , and touching . loved & # 34 ; holes ! & # 34 ; for kids , adults , and especially for teens . not for children under 8 or so .
this movie had plenty of laughs , not terrible acting and an ok story line . better than i expected from the previews .
this movie was amazing ! ! ! the first time i saw it i was scared stiff afterwards , i could n't sleep ! !
people kept telling me i had to see this show . i do n't have the channel it 's on so i decided to watch it from here . it 's really great and riveting
my granddaughter is more into this than i am , but she is thrilled with it and said it was just what she wanted .
arrived quickly and great packaging . i am in the process of replacing all my vhs tapes and going digital . i think the disc format is the best .
we loved it ! ! very fun and entertaining ! jeff is very talented , and his puppets take on a life of their own ! you wo n't be disappointed !
a lil bit of swearing in it and it has a nice story would recomend this one for kids !
this is the original frank oz directed , british version and is hilarious . a lot of fun to watch . way better than the remake version .
this movie is good have good action and very good special effect if u like witch craft u will enjoy
good movie . great story line . have enjoyed watching this movie . have always enjoyed christmas stories , so it is to like .
i bought the set for my husband he loves this show . now he can watch them whenever he wants to .
i can not tell you how on the mark this movie is , on so many levels - it 's almost depressing . it 's amazing the usa is even in business .
it does seem rather dated and of course it is . it was good if you like second world movies and it seems quite true to life at the time .
i loved the show when it aired on tv . i was very pleased about the quality of the dvd ' s .
this is great entertainment for my grandsons . they have a huge collection of thomas the train sets and the movie is another way to entertain them for a fun change .
i 'm glad i ordered this before the show closed . it has some great characters which have carried forward well into another program when the star left .
i enjoyed this informative documentary of the beginning of the usa . i think it was very well done and have watched it a couple of times and i am sure i will watch it again .
i love buying dvds with the making of included , this movie is great and a lot of fun to watch for all ages
i really liked this movie ... i can see why it was nominated for an oscar ! great job , ben ! a must see !
toy story 3 , this is the greatest story , the best one yet . this dvd was used as a gift , the grandkids really love it .
my brother had never seen it so we watched when he came for a visit ... well done , sick , and gross , but classic ...
scream started it off . love this movie . from the storyline to characters , a different twist . ghost face killer is awesome .
i guess it 's old enough to be a classic . this one has always made me laugh . if you like laughs , buy it .
i watched this in theater a few years back . not as good as i remembered , but still a good flick to watch . would recommend it .
wonderful movie . this is my favorite version . better than the one with angela l. nice story line and beautiful scenery .
this movie is innocent , silly , and funny . for the child in everyone , it 's the best modern movie . i only wish i had seen it in theaters .
dexter is just one of those shows that get 's better with time . this is a wonderful season with a lot of plot twists and surprises .
good cast , good story , great effects . good to watch in order ... ... .. ... ... ... . ... . ... ... ..
john adams is absolutely one of the best historical miniseries ever made . this is a must for any one who likes historical documentaries .
any series i like , i try to buy the dvd of a full season of that series . i really like the first season so far plan to get more seasons as they go along .
excellent movies , love having the set and love the way it is presented you can display as a book or keep it displayed with the movies .
loved it ! a great film , and very chilling . very interested to know if they will make a part 2 to this
i like how it went back and forth in time and tied the hole story together . another great family movie .
we have this on vcr but it started to drag so we went for the dvd , obviously we like the movie and the actors .
i watched all of the spiderman movies when they came out . this one , is a lot better than those . andrew garfield is an amazing actor . it is definitely worth buying !
i was very impressed with these movies and it was nice to see a good clean movie for once ! it would be nice to see movie clean movies made
the product was wonderful , as always . we always get good movies from amazon.com , and their sellers . we wo n't go anywhere else .
awesome movie . got it for my mother for christmas . sealed and in excellent condition . thank you for such a deal
loved this movie ... ... yes , it makes you laugh and it makes you cry . very touching story ... ... .great chemistry with the actors too . loved it !
a novel and interesting idea with a very poor execution . mainly a gore fest with no substance and no attempt to actually fit the story into the times it tells of .
this is one of those beautiful christmas concerts i 've ever seen . i first caught it on pbs this year and knew i had to buy the dvd for my christmas collection .
worth the price for ernest goes to africa and army . the other stuff is rather pointless . i did n't think even the movies were as good as some of his others .
i just love mark wahlberg and i like most of his movies . i love stories based on real life challenges .
lot 's of action and all the actors are very good . nice couple of hours of entertainment for an lazy afternoon .
i loved everything about this product . it 's just said that it ended . and i am so going to recommend you and the product
my kids really like this movie and they also like the reference to some of the video games they play . the message was good too . i really thought it was heartwarming !
i always liked this movie with 'the rock ' in this - too bad they did n't make another movie out of this with him in it !
this film is a reminder of what was like back in the 70 's . the music was good , but you could tell that the actors were new . wonder what they are up to today ?
full and action and i thought robert downey jr was excellent ... i really thought downey did an excellent job as iron man
could watch this movie all day long what a treasure every child should see this movie ! ! great lessons and how families should love each other !
i dont know what to say but its a true classic . also it has a nice list of special features that put this classic film experience right back into the theater .
this movie is a guilty pleasure for me . i never get tired of the performances , and i love the twist at the end .
what else can be said about this movie . good story , good music , good animation . my only wish ... it was available in 3d blu ray format
love this story ! i 'm not one for part 2 's , but the writers pull it off here . bringing the cast back was essential . hardly miss kirk douglas at all . beautiful cinematography too .
i still have quite a few more to go , until i have all of the collection complete . love the show , and it was in perfect condition !
i loved the movie as my son had told me that the movie was very good . i look forward to the next movie
yet confusing but amazing ! this movie has a huge twist but at the same time a scary touch to it !
a big fan of the series glad to have it on dvd always enjoyed the plots and sets they had back in that era .
typical scooby doo , fun around halloween time or any time . it is the good old scooby doo , not the newer ones .
i can not understand why they did not continue to produce this excellent series into more episodes and seasons . absolutely great acting and story lines .
this movie is one of my favorites by far . the story and cinematography are tops with me . a must see .
this is a wonderful series - i would love to go on but i need region one - i need usa version - please
i got this to watch with my niece because she loves tinkerbell . it was cute and she really loved it .
a must have for all star war fans . had to get this with the original star war series . completed my star wars collection .
for anyone over 12 this movie should be fine ; however the imagery presented to anyone younger will most likely give them nightmares for a very long time .
this was a good movie . it is not a high budget film , but it definitely a great message . this is a christian movie and depicts the end times .
poor quality film , hard to watch . acting not that good ; dubbed audio just makes it worse to watch . rent something else !
very good well worth a watch good plot and good acting would recommend to any one who likes monster movies
how nice to watch an happy film from beginning to end . it is full of great performances from all of the stars in it .
i love the whole series and ca n't wait for the two remaining films . thank you for making them available to me .
watched this with my grandkids and we were all disappointed that there was n't more holiday content . we were in the christmas mood and wanted a christmas movie .
did n't expect it to be `` dubbed '' but still good if you like the old classics .
i liked this movie , but i enjoyed the book alot more . they both played their roles really well , but it was kind of boring at times to me .
this movie was good and well written . the characters and storyline was unique . the actors did a great job . overall a good movie .
good show . elmo 's holiday christmas is better , but this is a nice change to watch for the holidays this year .
fun movie and great watching but i still prefer the orginal over the new movie .
loved this movie , took forever to get here , but worth the wait ! loved the twists and turns , but in the end everyone was where they needed to be .
my husband is more into than the kids . they all like the action , and humor . the story lines are great . never the same story .
this film has it all and i mean it all . porn , gore , horror , what more do you want for entertainment . great film .
i think this remake of the series was very good . my family enjoyed the movie and johnny depp did a fine job .
james garner is a bit unpredictable & also funny i loved the movie & needed another copy , so i bought this one
i bought the for my best friend and he watches it almost everyday now , now its nothing but references from this movie ! !
looking back on this early james bond piece , i am amazed that the series has continued to inspire people . i found the work badly edited , the audio was a joke , and acting stiff .
better than the 1st season , which set up the story . too bad it did n't get to go all 5 years . that would be really interesting .
i ca n't imagine how this stupid film won the oscar ! at least the dog played an excellent part . he should have won an oscar ! ! !
i would recommend this movie to any and every tyler perry fan ! a different movie for him ! ! i love it !
i have been a simply red fan for years and some far i 've gotten all their works on cd and now on dvd , keep up great work .
solid writing . solid acting . believable storylines . i have watched all 4 seasons in less than a month and now i do n't know what to do .
anytime i need to be in a better mood , this is my go to movie . i can just about say it word for word , but still laugh & cry every time ! !
very good series and must see if you liked the first season . they should make a third .
great show . if you are a fan , owning all the seasons is necessary . each season get 's better and better in my opinion .
ordered this for a gift for my daughter and granddaughter and they loved it . would recommend this to anyone interested !
i still have to practice a little bit more , but i think is a good routine . it really make me sweat !
the movie surprised me . i did not expect it to be so good . i really enjoy this movie and recommend it .
this is one of my favorite steve martin movies . i love it . the product was in great condition , and i am excited to have it .
the 3d version makes all the difference in viewing this movie . i enjoyed that aspect . it is a good movie for history buffs .
it is a great movie . my child loved it and is watching it more all the time . it is a good movie to add to your movies at home . we love it at my house .
bought this for my daughter who is a big `` rent '' fan - now she knows i 'm the best mom ever ...
i had never seen this movie , but everyone told me it was good . i finally was able to get it and i enjoyed it . glad to have it in my tom hanks collection .
i love this movie . one of my favorite movies . it makes me laugh so much . watch it all the time .
i really love the first movie with drew in it but not so much th second movie it really does n't follow the first one .
what a beautiful film . gorgeous cinematography . well told story with just enough funny bits to keep it fun . probably one i 'd watch again and again . do n't hesitate , this is a winner .
very good graphics . a more realistic storyline version of the multiple attempts of the comic book epic . very good movie !
while the story was so-so , the cg was too much and took away from the movie . did n't like it much .
well , what more can be said ? it 's steven seagal , doing what he does the very best ... taking names and kicking butt ! ! !
this is a christmas tradition ! its awesome from the story , visuals , music and feeling you get from it . if you have n't seen this , then you are missing out : )
it was a refreshing movie . simple story line . cute acting . i just enjoyed a simple movie with a happy ending .
the disc came with no scratches and plays perfectly . it also came like the picture is & love the movie .
if you have never seen this movie , you have to see it . very good story . good acting by helen and matthew . picture quality and sound is great !
great show , great cast , great stories and very well written . as good as law and order ! i would highly recommend !
two actors doing a very good job in an interesting story line . the dialogue was intelligent and kept my interest throughout . a man and woman in a very erotic situation portrayed in a subtle but sexy way .
had to replace this one - gave it to a friend and decided to get again to have my steven seagal collection complete again .
i personally love sci-fi with action and adventure . this has lots of action but lacks the adventure . overall , this is a good watch .
i had not heard of this movie before - the movie was very good and suspenseful ! i would recommend it to all .
what a spin on the actual story . i love it , such a great ending . i knew that the wolf was n't all bad . situations could make a wolf out of the best of us .
this movie is also a keeper ! this is a true story of one very brave woman ! buy it before all of the copies are gone !
this movie was great . i love the acting the singing . i watch it over and over . love it . buy it wo n't regret .
this is true british humor at its best . after watching this buy the newest movie for sure to keep the humor going .
worth having amazon prime just for the ability to watch this series again . not for the kids but realistic for adults .
i have written this review 3 times in the last 2 years ... can this please be the last time ? `` it was a gift . ''
this gets a five star ... my grandaughter loves this shop ... requested it for christmas ... if she loves it ... i love giving it to her ...
apart from being a jennifer garner fan , all the other actors are sooo good too in this movie ! ! ! excellent writing and acting and soundtrack too .
a beautiful movie with a decent story , but something was missing that kept it from being great . i liked father and son working together .
i keep recording it when it comes on television . by having my own copy , i can see it whenever i want !
kids love this movie . the movie came before christmas and my daughter was so excited to find it in her stocking .
love it love it . this movie is a true classic . one of my go to movies of all times . highly recommend purchasing it .
this was just as funny as i expected it to be ! i loved it - i laughed so much while watching . glad i bought it !
this is one of our favorite movies and is especially beautiful in blu ray . i would be satisfied with either the theatrical version or the director 's cut .
never watch this movie . you will waste years off your life and wish very badly to suck them back . i mean , luke perry . do we need to say anything else here ?
my friend 's kid bought this on my kindle fire before i realized it so i watched it . very entertaining especially if you love the despicable me movies .
did n't like this one bit . only saving grace was that tom was in it . story was contrived and a little stupid . do n't even bother with it .
would recommend this to any young girls and is just another great walt disney movie - any body would like it
its an old classic and a favourite too . great movie like many one i have ordered from amazon , have not been disappointed .
season 2 coming to dvd . may i say this is a pleasant surprise , considering how many good shows never get past the 1st season on dvd .
not great but not bad . was n't my favorite but kept me entertained on a boring night at home . rent it only . dont buy
the dry humor makes this movie enjoyable . good for a quiet night at home . the plot finally comes around once you become used to listening to their efforts to speak as in the old english day .
i like this move it has family fun i cant wait tell it comes in dvd i love this move
my daughters and i ca n't get through the holidays without seeing this all time favorite and classic ! i recommend it for all ages .
i have a dvd of this film and it is better than this bluray ! picture quality of this film is very bad ! dont buy this !
what can i say . the music is perfect , the supporting cast spot on and the added bonus of the trailer all combine to make this a must have for don knotts fans .
it was funny . but not as good as the first one . still found it to be entertaining . the parts that are funny , are really funny
this was so depressing and so violent i could n't stand to watch the whole thing . very sorry i rented it .
i had to introduce my family to this great , epic story ! i wanted the blu-ray for the best presentation available !
pretty good , a bit silly but i am sure kids really like it . now i have to add works to meet the minimum .
this movie is always a favorite , not a kid movie . i loved it so much that after i received the movie i realized i had already purchased it some other time .
received this set in a timely manner . am enjoying watching these stories . some i figured out and some i did n't . would recommend this series .
i purchased this dvd set for my daughter so she could catch up on the last season . soon she will no longer be `` lost '' about lost !
it made me think about the human body and the changes that we take for granted . one day at a time
well made world war 11 action series . they had many diverse and interesting plot lines .
both my daughter and my son love to watch this mickey movie ! we have watched it about three times a week since christmas !
we remembered this series being so much better than it was . guess it did n't stand the test of time . kids were a little bored with it .
it 's a lot of politics in this episode . should be worthy one 's time of watching it if you are into politics .
excellent movie . i love sandra bullock and nicole kidman in this film . powerful , yet opposite in their abilities . truly enjoyed it .
i do n't watch tv normally ... but this series has captured me . looking forward to next season ... wish there were n't so many months between them !
i watched this just to see if robert deniro could pull off a character set in a different time . he did . i did n't like the ending though . i guess i like happier endings .
if you have n't seen it , it 's very good . funny , sentimental . the little girl in it is the reason to watch it .
i saw this as a play and as a movie . it is a funny , and yet sad story . dolly is such a hoot .
more creative with each episode these people are the greatest at what they do i can not wait to watch each show
this is one of my favorite series . lots of action , this is very well done . there are four in the series .
this movie was entertaining and it made me think . there were several storylines happening at once - and all were interesting . definitely worth watching .
great love story ! and i love the era when this movie was made . i love movies that make feel the emotion . great movie .
i think that say 's it all a big waste of money i wish i never bought it i sold it to buy back 's
i am a big fan of godzilla and was happy to find these dvds . great price and fast shipping .
just an entertaining western movie . always was a henry fonda fan . this movie would not make it today since there is not a lot of sex , violence and vulgar language .
ca n't go wrong with & # 34 ; the office & # 34 ; . this season was a little weak , but a must have for fans who are getting the entire series .
a neat twist in the story line but not up to the level of the first two in the series . worth seeing , yes . worth paying for ... well , you decide that .
i 'm a tom selleck fan so far all of the movies i have seen him in i liked , this one did n't disappoint .
if you do n't watch it expecting it to be related to the other halloween movies , it 's ok. it has nothing to do with any of the other halloween movies .
when i saw this at 10 years old , i absolutely loved it . it was one of my favorite books as a child , and the movie is even better . i would recommend it to anyone .
i 've seen it before - well worth a second watch . mel gibson in one of his better performances . good buy !
this purchase had been a long time coming . i 'm glad i decided to buy on amazon . it was affordable and the seller was very prompt . thanks ! ! ! ! ! !
i especially liked the commentaries , which talked about the history of the two versions of the film .
i thought this movie was exactly what it was made for . a 13 year old girl . did n't watch it again .
i was very happy with this item and i loved everything about the seller and would definitely buy from them again .
overall a good simple thriller with a few twist and turns kept me entertained . not overly complicated but very entertaining .
i guess i was expecting another story like the first one . but this did hold my attention and that 's saying a lot .
i 'm not sure if i liked this or not . took me too long to read i like to understand things better than i did .
this was a gift for a friend and he was delighted with the movie as he had never seen it .
my sister and i are always waiting for the older musicals to come out in blu ray . this is a delight .
entertained the whole family ! wish there were more movies that mom , dad , and kids could all enjoy . good clean fun !
this was a good , low budget movie worth renting . if you like the genre then i think you wont be disappointed .
i love any movie with kristen stewart in it . this was an amazing movie over all . i really enjoyed it .
we had this one on a tape for years and we thought it was funny enough to replace it with a dvd .
good workouts , again that can be done in a shorter amount of time , but you will see results if you are consistent with them .
this was a very good movie , i bought it because i heard good reviews on it and i was not disappointed . i would recommend purchasing it to anyone who asked .
this movie will keep you on the edge of your seat , a lot of magic and suspense , hugh and christian great performance .
love watching this show . love being able to see it anytime now and love it . i love this show too much
loving to watch the classic season of a great show to show our family and the laughs all over again
my husband liked this movie when it came out so getting it for him was a treat . we took our time watching it ( over 3 nights ) even though it was hard to stop .
a great series for any sherlock fan . wish they did more than 4 shows . great watching with great writing . waiting now for season 4 .
the third season in a great show that shows just because your a genius does n't mean that your not an idiot .
what bond movies used to be and had lost . of course daniel craig has helped bring that back ! but great flick !
i absolutely love morse ! i ca n't wait for more episodes . love the plots and when i think i know who did it ... wrong ! great show !
couldnt believe the price ! i bought it and added it to my shelf of scary movies
i actually like it a lot more action is awsome ninja is something i really enjoy . the sword and everything .
at first appearance the movies shown appear mediocre , but the first four discs which i have watched so far are quite acceptable
one of the great biblical movies , on dvd it should be presented in it 's original widescreen format .
i already owned the dvd , and just bought this as part of my effort to upgrade my video library to blu-ray quality .
i watched this movie when my son was grade school aged . i surprised him with it for christmas and it brought back a lot of memories .
this movie was awesome , awesome , awesome , full of action and drama at every turn , this is one for the dvd collection to watch over and over again .
i thoroughly enjoyed this film . the images were incredible , beautiful in fact . the story was smart and engaging . a a great edition to the christmas genre .
this is another classic steve martin film . michael caine is great as well . transfer quality on the blu-ray is great . not a lot of extras , but that 's never been important to me personally .
my daughter loved tarzan , so i bought this dvd . poor sequel , bad plot , not at all i was expecting . do n't waste your money .
i thought that this was a great family movie . i thought it was funny in parts and the kids loved it.i will buy this on blu-ray after seeing this . the boys loved this
good movie . lots of action . wish they would have made it clearer that the two main characters had actually become more friend like than it did but it was still very entertaining .
i saw this movie on life time movie channel and was pleasantly surprised at how good the movie really was . the acting was great and the movie did keep my interest until the very end .
i hate that people say he 's a bad actor , well apparently audiences do n't think so or he still would n't be getting lead roles ! give the people what they want ! keanu rocks !
another great & # 34 ; old & # 34 ; movie . i remember seeing it in the theatre and could n't believe the beginning scenes . i 'm a huge robert redford fan .
there are some people who play their roles in a set fashion -- and schwarzenegger is one of those . too much violence and blood for the pg set & # 8230 ; and me .
overall it was a good movie ; however , there was n't as many scary parts as i had expected there to be .
i had forgotten what a great movie this is . i am glad i purchased it . the watch bear is my favorite character .
great movie good download would recommend it you really need to watch the first one if you have not already in order to understand the 2nd
i 'd heard it was n't good , so my expectation level was low . but i thought it better than the first one .
i have to say that this exceeded my expectations . the footage and the sound is incredible . high quality video too .
this movie is the back bone of paul walker history in the story , need to have this movie to complete the whole story , if you like fast five , you would like this one .
it was ok. entertaining , a bit slow , and very sad , but the actors were great !
i was n't to thrilled with this movie . it had a lot of unnecessary swearing and ended up being very dumb and corny .
i loved this movie . it was a great suspenseful horror movie . it kept my interest and i was very surprised by the ending . worth watching .
it 's a okay movie . not worth buying , but i guess it is a nice movie to watch at least once .
of all adaptations of a christmas carol , this is the best one . george c. scott is the perfect scrooge .
i always enjoyed this show when it was on . it 's great to have it on dvd now . it came promptly after being ordered .
do not do not do not do not waste your money on this awful movie . they obviously had no budget .
i like this move my husband loves it . it is sweet and heartwarming . nice movie to watch for the holidays
well worth the price . this was excellent . the movie is as greats . movie arrived promptly and was in brand new condition . very sweet story . this was adorable .
good movie my mom loved it , and it was for mothers day so mission accomplished : ) i saw it long ago and still just as good : )

i have been buying this tv series for awhile , i am finally getting close to having the complete series and will be glad .
like the movie worth the watch really can '' t say much more it 's a good movie person sent it very quick ; y

ive always loved this movie because its such a great story and im so glad i have it in blu ray now !
this was a christmas gift for my husband . he really enjoyed it but it is a very old movie . john wayne is very young in this movie .
i ordered this for my grandaughter . i have had the complete series for quite sometime and she fell in love with the series .
love to watch this film over and over . excellent chemistry between the lead actors . great story to watch . wish more films like this were made .
with disney packaging their movies with a digital copy and a dvd , this is a value that can not be beat .
not as good as the other ones . kind of slow paced . but my son wanted the series . the collection of all the terminator movies .
whats not to like about clint eastwood ! all his movies are good entertainment for adults but not small children .
after watching , you ask yourself , did this really happen ? frightening . christopher walken is always worth watching .
my husband and i look at this movie all the time , it is a great movie thank you so much
i liked it well enough . not the best ever but definitely one of the better movies to come out in recent years .
it came in great condition and on time . it is a wonderful classic that the whole family can sit down and watch over and over again .
it looked like a good horse movie.it is a good family movie , with a good theme and plot and a happy ending . oh yea ! yes i would recommend it !
this is one of my favorite war movies . it shows the great struggle in wwii , how the war changed from this point on . from this point on germany goes down hill .
i gave it 5 stars because i love sci-fi of all sorts . this show has all the elements of it , action adventure imagination . if you really like sci-fi you will love this one .
i have become really fond of this series , and the events that take place in it . i was hoping for more , but it was short lived .
this is a great romance movie . my wife and i have watched this movie more than once . i would recommend this movie .
i loved this movie ! it was hilarious and kept my grandchildren 's interest until it was over which is hard to do !
i love this show ! ! it is amazing , it is another take of robin and i like it ! ! even though it is three seasons it is still a good show to watch
this should be rated pg-13 , it is gross and nonsense . honestly , i would n't suggest anyone at any age watch it .
another great movie for my musicals collection . love the music in this one . lighthearted movie and great for all ages .
very good movie . the visual was awesome for when this was made . a well done movie . i would tell others about it .
excellent movie . i could n't wait to watch it . it brought back sweet memories of my younger days . my daughter is a fan as well .
great makeup effects . good story line with some twists . i thoroughly enjoyed . johnny depp is really good .
it is my fault but i wanted a movie not a documentary . if you like documentaries then you will probably like it . i do n't care for them personally . i had hoped for so much more .
another great movie by denzel . i throughly enjoy watching his movies and character . he is the best i have seen
another classic i just had to get ! love it and it came quick !
a great movie - was recommended this by a friend so i just found it and bought it . good story - i enjoyed it .
never get tired of watching this movie or the whole series . the movie is well written and produced and acting could n't be better .
the movie was just ok , nothing so great about it , would not want to see it again , and would tell my friends save the money
i am out of touch with what is on tv but i found 24 on amazon prime and ca n't seem to turn it off it is sooo good .
this was a pretty good movie , more than i was expecting . i just do n't like the ending that much but over all it was decent for a dark movie type .
watching this through with the kids ( under 10 ) . they are enthralled and it holds my attention as well . different and fun .
great movie ( one of my all time favorites ) , blu-ray is a bit soft but still ok considering the movie is a bit dated .
i bought this dvd because the film sounded so interesting & it got great reviews . they were right . it was fantastic .
my daughter and i needed a movie and this one was pretty good . i did n't think i would like it and it was actually a decent action type movie . i was pleasantly surprised .
still enjoying the series . great cast , characters and writing , and story line . i wish there were more episodes in a season !
as someone who likes all kinds of movies , i thought that this selection would be a worthwhile watch . it was not finished .
this is an average movie not really exciting or anything , but pretty decent story line it was worth the money i paid .
just think if something like that actually happened ? i liked watching it and the action was very good.i will be looking for more of these types .
the cast of frasier was great and seemed to always click with each other . i wish frasier and cheers could have gone on forever .
it 's all good to watch star trek ... .. this stuff never gets old . reruns you can always watch a get things you missed the first time you watch
i loved it , i 've saw one and two . definately a must have for a horror fan .
i had high hopes for this movie , but i was slightly disappointed . i think all the good parts were shown in the previews . it seemed to be exceptionally long .
this movie was nice to put in and kick back . love the story . the dvd case was average , not much to complain about .
james cagney was at his best in this one ( i do n't think i ever saw a movie of his that i did n't like ! i ca n't wait to view it again .
liam neeson is a great actor . i love all his movies and this one is a must see . lots of action , and suspense ... great
3d effects are mainly still shots , i was disappointed . i am a sucker for war movies . i have some of the items shown in the movie .
this movie is very touching . friend told me that it was good and he was right . i had to buy it . great movie ! !
this movie is fun and funny . my kids love it and i thought it was great too . jack black was funny and did a really good job .
the soundtrack of this movie is great . the story is fun and the scenery is wonderful . the movie was a big hit in its day , and it still holds up .
i bought this movie because i like musicals and this movie is a classic musical . i will keep it forever
a excellent thriller movie . makes one not want to leave their seat . you would be surprised of the outcome . one must see the movie .
although i had seen this in the movies , i still wanted to own a copy for myself and my friends , it is one of mel brooks best ! !
i saw this movie when it first came out , so very , very funny ! billy crystal and meg ryan are superb in it .
i loved the series am very pleased that it was finally released to dvd . hopefully more old - really great series will become available on dvd in the future
save your time and money , do something else than buying or even rent this movie . pure waste of time . why ca n't we give zero star , because this one really deserve it .
do n't understand why this movie did n't win best picture of the year . is there nothing jennifer can do ? what a great actress . i just loved this movie and i know you will too .
you had to follow the story really close as it jumps a lot . it was an okay movie , to long with to many jumps
well written , good acting , great costumes and sets . entertaining to watch . what more is necessary to say i ask you .
truly one the the best dramatic movies ever made and wonderfully restored by warner 's . keep up the great work on your oldies .
why does amazon take videos off so one can not watch or rent them . i was so looking forward to renting this for my kids .
as always , csi is awesome . love it and all that good stuff .
a great show that is well worth buying . i have them all so far and ca n't wait for the rest to be released . definitely one of the all time greats .
how can you go wrong with this cast ? ! need i say more ... action , comedy , etc loved it ! ! this movie had it all .
this movie is just an ok movie . didnt like how it ended though . kinda made me mad at what happened , brought me to wondering what the point of the movie was in the first place
this movie starts out funny and ends on a serious note . a different take on what an angel might be like .
i 've seen the theater version but not the extended yet . ordered as a gift for christmas and i am excited to watch on the new big screen .
we love the middle . we started watching it towards the end of the 3 season . we wanted to view the previous seasons for a little more information . love it .
this was recommended to me and i had no idea what i was getting into . not quite sure if i liked it enough to get season 2
i give 5 stars because i like the show . the costumes are perfect . the dialog is great , and the morals depicted are good for all audiences . please , pbs , more of the same !
a great remake from the original ! eventually will purchase it ! i hope everyone gets a chance to see it also !
what can i say ? it has the duke , jimmy stewart and lee marvin as a really evil villian ! what more do you want ?
if i could give this video a minus 5 , i would . bad script and bad acting combined with an obvious low production budget make this one of the worst videos i have ever watched .
i bought this for my three year old son for christmas . he absolutely loves them . we watch them over and over . very good purchase .
what more can you expect with hd quality . . . bright colors , clarity ! i got it all and am 100 % happy with it . no complaints here !
my daughter got this movie for christmas and she loves it ! we saw it in theaters and waited for the price to go down before purchasing . a great price and came quickly .
i like action movies and will smith and sci fi settings . i thought this movie would be geared a little differently and it seemed like will smith made this as a vehicle for his son 's acting career .
they just keep getting better ... although the story falls off the cliff on this one ... leaves little hope for a future sequel
my aunt wanted this movie for her birthday so i bought it for her , i showed it to her and she told that tis is what she wanted .
we bought these for my parents . they seemed happy to get them and watch very little else on tv . good stories , well acted by a great cast .
these actors must have had a great time making this movie . they all work so well together . love listening to the old songs my dad enjoyed so much . surely brings back a lot of memories .
kind of a mix of war of the worlds , alien mind and stand by me . not deep but highly entertaining .
this group is wonderful . i love the songs they sing and their voices are beautiful to listen to . they put a lot of energy in every song .
the best doctor who ever . you will enjoy all the clear detail of the blu-ray . brings all the extras to you
this film is from the 80s - not the michael moore we know today . it 's worth a watch , but nothing to write home about .
love it ! dry humor , good actors , good period piece . take the time to watch ; i think you 'll agree with me .
too long . the direction of the plot was confusing at times . the scenery , filming , cinematography , and acting were great . this was an overall mediocre movie .
this movie is incredible . i do n't have words to describe it . i was moved from the first time i saw it .
great movies . had a family movie night and these were a total hit . would highly recommend ! my kids wanted to watch them again and again !
my brother wanted this , and i 've heard neither bad nor good from him . he likes humphrey bogart in most movies .
this movie is rather slow and does n't tell how both wesley brothers were married . in this movie , they are still single at the end of the movie . a rather strange take on the wesley brother .
i grew up reading my brothers comic books and thoroughly enjoyed them . so setting the stories come to life on the screen is very . i love the story lines and actors chosen
it was a good movie . lots of action and the scenes were filmed very well . great price , shipped fast . i recomend this movie to anyone .
hooked after watching two shows . so we had to go back and watch it from the start ! ca n't wait till new season !
i love this movie used to watch it on vhs when i was a kid , but sadly the vcr broke so have been getting dvds and it is great thanks
love john wayne . i did n't have this in my collection of john wayne dvd 's . would recommend to anyone who loves john wayne or who loves westerns in general .
i love family and family kind of movies i did not a lot of brothers and sisters i only 1 brother . but i especially like the way they care and love one another .
i really enjoy these movies . there is something old fashioned yet very modern about them . old meets new , and a really great line up of actors .
my little boy loves this show and watched the second season in just a few days . he is already wanting the third season . kids love this show and i would highly recommend it .
a classic 80 's movie in my mind . i throughly enjoyed it . if you do n't like 80 's movies like animal house you probably wont like it .
my grandchildren loves this movie . we are getting ready to watch it now and will again and again . it is great .
i absolutely love the music in this movie and the acting is superb . it is such a good story ! ! ! it 's fantastic ! !
good story , but too much sadness . you get a little bored after you figure out what is going to happen next . but good acting .
love this movie and the kids do too very nice for the family to teach and get close to god a much see !
easily the best film of the entire trilogy , if not the best of all time .
if you like this type of spoof , you will certainly enjoy this one ! pop some popcorn and get ready to laugh !
my friend loves the movie and i got it for him . i did not see it , i only purchased it .
loved it . can not wait for the second and third seasons to be released . why is it taking so long for them to be released ?
this movie pack was a great deal , some movies i have tried to get before , and that made this value pack even better and the price was right , give it a try
this was a good value ... 4 good action films at a great price ... ordered another 4 film collection ... another good value ... great price too .
some people may think this movie is stupid but me i find it funny . watch and see u will like it 2
this is n't the first time i 've seen this movie . it is one of the best movies ever made by mel gibson and the photography is absolutely unbelievable . loved it ! ! ! ! !
seen it on tv when it was first aired and had to have my own copy . could hardly wait until it came out on dvd , now we own it .
love this movie it continues very nicely with the second one . like every part of it was very funny , laugh very hard
i have always liked mark wahlberg movies . good movie , good story , good acting , what more could someone ask for ?
it is n't fair for me to only give this 3 stars since i could n't watch it past the first 20 minutes . i really wanted to watch and like this movie but it was n't for me .
very good acting , starting with george clooney , who is n't a movie star in this film . top-notch script and directing , too .
after watching the first two , i had high expectations but was pretty disappointed . nice special effects , but the movie did not impress me at all ...
i loved this series from beginning to end . the only bad thing about it is that there were only four episodes .
just buy it , add it to your collection , and enjoy the extra content on your own schedule .
this is a really good movie and i would highly recommend it to anyone who loves this genre . great to see arnold and sly together . they were great and the plot was great too .
i luv this movie . i think it 's hilarious . i really like these new romantic comedies that are n't all about falling in love and have some fun behind them .
the seller of this was great . however , the movie is n't how we remembered it . the stories are long and drawn out .
it arrived in perfect condition and shipped fast . you can tell the movie is a lower budget film but it has a good message ! it was good for it 's price .
interesting plot twists and acting , enough action to keep it moving along , and the final twist i honestly did n't see coming . worth a watch .
the bone collector is a great movie , full of action and suspense , but very predictable . denzel of course was awesome in it .
i 've never seen the world like this in a movie before . everything you look at or touch blows up it seems .
if you watched & # 34 ; band of brother & # 34 ; you need to watch this also . the pacific version . this would be worth put in the cinema .
this is the first of the series with bruce willis . great movie , lots of action , violence and language . not for children .
definitely the best terminator of the franchise ! i love the crisp quality of the blu-ray and the fact that it offers different versions of the film ,
this story line was very weak and the movie was mostly boring . i wish it had been better the subject a good one but not developed very well
great movie and a great cast , i had seen it when if first aired . i would recommend watching this movie .
who would have thought john cusack and meg ryan were the voices . i wanted to update my collection from vhs to blue-ray and the price was just right .
not sure if this is typical japanese anime , but it was okay . i 'm not a good judge of this genre , but it held my interest .
love this movie and i 'm not usually a fan of horror at all . great acting all the way . i particularly enjoyed the added features on this special edition .
i love this movie . so entertaining and funny . i ca n't believe how young katherine heigl is in this movie . will certainly watch again and again .
fun and exciting movie with grand camera work and interesting characters . al ages will love this one . smooth directing makes this a joy !
ok , movie could have been better if they got a little more into the story it seems like something was missing , but i liked it .
with two young iron man fans in the house with their own dvd players , it is nice to have the extra discs . the special features are terrific and the blu-ray looks awesome .
one of those rare movies that 's so well done that even though i know the story and the outcome , i 'm on the edge of my seat every time i see it !
its got here a little later then i would like but its all safe and sound i am happy that i have all the movies now
i bought this for my 4 year old grandson ... .. he loves john wayne ... .. so that is why i rated this movie as superior ! !
this movie is really funny . the actors did a great job . a lot of scenes in this movie are really funny . good date movie .
i enjoy this movie . if you are looking for a movie that it is soft and easy to understand . this is a good choice .
it was n't as good as i remembered it . it was interesting however , and worth the small amount of cash i paid for it .
ken burns has done it again . his work is fantastic . highly recommend this dvd . interesting and informative . you will not be disappointed .
this movie is pretty good for it 's time . i really liked it . and i hope you will to i recommend it for everyone . if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
i never knew what was going to happen and the scary scenes which were many were very believable . watch again !
this dvd was purchased to replace my vhs version . it is a good christmas classic that i enjoy watching every december .
i gave 5 stars its the best western i 've seen in a long time . i would recomend this to adults
love johnny depp ! i liked the story line and humor in this flick . ca n't beat johnny in a tim burton movie
love it i 'm a big disney fan and i was so happy to get this movie and enjoy watching it with my family
it was great i just got it and watched it and got to say its 1 of 2 best magic movies i have seen
liam neeson is one good actor . ca n't figure out who the bad guy is until the end . very entertaining but you have to pay attention .
no the quality is n't great and hd tv 's are n't helpful to it , but it is still great fun to rewatch those great stories over and over . highly recommended for fans of this old series .
this has a good story just three parts i wish it was more . it is a cool story and great special effects considering the time .
this is by far one of the most boring movies i have ever seen ! i dont understand what is going on with hollywood , but , wow . just plain boring !
i am a huge fan of the show and realize how silly it is from time to time . but i just love it so so much ! great show
great addition to any collection great dvd special effects and how the movie was made . makes one proud of our country
love the noir feel to this show and the old cars ! this volume is still very well made and the picture and sound of the dvds are great !
maybe it 's just because i did n't read the book , but i thought this movie dragged on and was very boring . but , the special effects seemed cool .
i watched this over a two day period , and was glad i did because there are 6 story lines and you need to pay attention . great visuals . wonderful characters .
we love science fiction so this was perfect for us . we watched it non-stop and can hardly wait for next season !
interesting sherlock holmes perspective . a new and different way to see sherlock holmes and company . dvds , cases and covers are ok .
was surprised , didnt think it would be good , turns out to be very funny , at times nicely goofy . enjoyed , cgi space battle was fantastic .
this was a very funny romantic comedy . it 's older but still very funny . had to also order one for my son .
great movie collection ! it was awesome that it comes with both the theatrical releases for each film plus the directors cuts . classic sci fi suspense movies and the quality is awesome as well !
after watching the first movie and enjoying it very much i looked forward to seeing this one . not disappointed , very enjoyable .
this is an awesome movie . i have watched it a lot and was rolling in laughter . there are some dumb parts but thats what makes it funny
jodie foster is always just awesome ! very different plot , well acted , no one believed her story , good ending ! ! love her movies !
to me , this movie was complicated to follow . the plot was all over the place . did not keep my attention at all . turned it off before it was over . regret buying it .
you 'll love these movies ! ! richard is great in all these movies & you 'll have your favorite & then you 'll enjoy the others too because you have n't seen them in so long ! ! !
these are good dvd 's . no problems with them . arrived when they were suppose to .
this is one of the best movies ever . got to love judi dench ! the story line is wonderful and just to think it was based on a real event .
i like this movie it is very entertaining and keeps your attention . i had to buy this movie when i saw it .
both this movie and the sequel are truly entertaining . i love all the actors and the story is great . highly recommend
i bought this movie for my husband because he loves it , but i did n't realize that it was the rated version . oh well my fault !
every high school student in america should be required to see this . it is history that is told by real people about real events in a fashion that makes war become real .
this movie was good . i enjoyed watching it . well worth the watch . have added to my collection . a must see .
my daughter turned me on to this movie and i was n't disappointed ! it was a little dark , just the way i like a good movie ... simply loved it ! ! ! ! !
reminds me of ... . west side story it was fabulous to me ... this movie is a hidden gem of color music dancing and characters .
who could not like this series . it is so funny . the baby is a hoot and the play on words really funny
a gift for my niece , which she asked for . i did not get to see her use it so my comments are limited .
this series will keep you on the edge of your seat ... the lives of the characters are diverse and interesting . awesome .
love this show . its so funny and cute . just love looking back in time and seeing these good old classics .
i looked for this movie many years after my brother introduced me to it . it is beautifully written and holds the story of love and faith . it 's a real tear jerker .
i am not always into these type of movies , but will stay this one surprised me . liked enough to say i did n't waste my money . sat back and watch a very well done movie .
good movie , but not one you want to watch if you are planning to fly in the near future or there is a thunder storm .
great special effects ( considering there was no cgi when it was made ) , neat costumes and a charming performance by jane fonda .
i really enjoyed this movie it was funny with lots of action and adventure i just love jeff bridges he is a good actor and i do enjoy most of his movies
great christmas movie . very heart warming . this movie is one the entire family will enjoy watching . would recommed this movie for the whole family
another great movie in the series . this one is my twin daughters favorite so far !
talk about a heart-warming , charming tale . i loved this movie . it was well written , super cute , and funny . i highly recommend it .
this movie was as fantastic and great and it just as i remember it when the kids were little . great !
my 4 and 8 year olds love this movie . it was really cheap so it 's going to make a great gift along with the rest of their christmas gifts .
dirty dancing is one of my long time favorites . i love the music and the dancing is awesome ! and patrick swayze is nice looking as a bonus . jennifer grey does a great job also .
i thought the movie was poorly directed and the acting seemed forced . the characters were very cliche . did not care for this movie . i wanted to like it because i love meryl streep .
it was a really good movie . needed more special affects . your typical b movie . no known actors or actress . bye
i loved the movie , it was awesome . i received my dvd in a very timely manner and in great condition . i am very pleased and will look forward to purchasing more dvd 's in the future .
finally , the nanny is on dvd ! i am so excited , it 's so good that this hilarious show is on dvd .
if you like sherlock holmes at all or are a true fan , this is a must . well done and historical .
these are older movies that i have in vhs and totally enjoyed so i purchased to add to my collection of dvd movies .
still wish he would have played the hulk in the avengers movies ! he is a perfect hulk ! plenty of action and love the emotion behind his eyes !
fun movie to watch . good story and good sports action . acting and story good but not great . worth watching this movie .
an old fashioned film with plenty of humour and no violence . the dialogue is very witty .
i think this is an excellent movie . lots of good things to learn about life and love .
got this one for old times sake . doris at her best , rock at his best . very very funny movie . you will laugh or you 're dead .
season 4 is a great continuation of the downton abbey series . if you enjoyed the first 3 seasons then you will enjoy this one too .
i have always loved to watch frasier on tv but i feel that the few first seasons are the best instead of the later seasons .
i never paid much attention to russell brand until i saw this movie . then i decided that i had to have the dvd .
this is a great set of classic movies to watching during the holiday season . a good value for such a variety .
i enjoyed this movie , and it was one of ll cool j 's first to act in . i like his acting ... .
we 've always liked this movie and bought the dvd to replace the vhs tape . it 's a laugh out loud movie .
what 's not to love about these two leads ? ! fun travel movie with great scenes and great interaction between stars . have watched a few times over the years . always entertained .
bette davis fan ! i own most of her movies ! will purchase more for my library ! i share these movies with my friends
another of the classic westerns , always a good plot sometimes ahead of its time . these are characters that we grew up with as children and good to be able to see them again .
i expected more with the big cast but i was disappointed . it was a little funny , a little cute but lacking in almost every category .
really great movie with really great songs . who knew kristen bell could sing . love to watch it fairly often and definitely one to own .
a terrible movie , makes no sense , not worth the price , all reviews that i read have been low rated , i got it because it was cheap . cheap does not always mean good .
the movie for me was a bit of a put down . not near as exciting as i expected it to be . ! disc played , but the other did n't .
i bought this for for actors who were in it . ok script , a bit refreshing , a little different from the usual kids comedy .
this is a very comical movie . it 's a lot of fun to watch with kids especially . one of adam sandler 's best .
if you do n't want to buy the series it is really worth renting , there are some very graphic parts but in all not to bad compared to alot of other shows .
this was a very good movie experience . it was well written and funny . not too unbelievable , similar movies in this genre .
i am an audie fan and this was ok for its time on tv . he was a better actor but tv was not too good yet and did not bring out the best in the actors .
both of these movies are great . i wish they did sequels for adult movies as well as children 's movies . my grandson and i watched them over and over . literally !
did n't like it , we had to order another one to see the movie , we thought this was the movie , so we lost money on it .
this is my son 's favorite show . i was able to purchase it during the holiday season at a terrific price . planned to buy it anyway .
ca n't get enough of elmo ' s world definitely a good buy . would recommend to others shop are looking for saga great elmo dvd
i remember this being funnier when i was a kid . sometimes nostalgia is best left as such the amount of one liners in this is still pretty amazing .
i bought this movie for my sister so i did n't watch it . but it arrived quickly and my sister loves it .
i got this in like two days ! this shipped super fast , and this is n't easy to find so i 'm glad it was of nice quality .
i could watch this movie over and over again . i love the music and the movie . would recommend this for anyone .
just was n't for me . i found it somewhat boring at times . the ending was rather sad . it was just okay .
this was so funny ! ! could have been based on my son . i love comedy and have a lot of fun with these .
even though the book was written by a french author , the movie of the same name was a wonderful to watch as a family .
season 5 of roseanne was by far my favorite season when it came to reality on a tv series . so many real things happened this season .
i was n't expecting the movie to be the same as the book , and it was n't , but i really liked it and thought the performances were splendid .
what a fun movie ! predictable , but giant robots fighting monsters , with a different twist . very enjoyable movie . would recommend to any sci fi fan .
not a great movie but good action and you get to see the stars of the 70s , 80s and 90s .
extremely fell in love with the characters and loved the movie . it was unique in its own way . i love the family dynamics and the story line fits right in .
it was well made and engaging . gorgeous to look at . wondered what happened to the characters after the story ended . want to see more of a few of the actors .
if you want this movie , buy the blu-ray version . it 's both cheaper and has a better quality movie .
this is number one in my dvd collection . i watch it every day and never get tired of any of the programs . i hope this series never ends .
i am only five episodes in , but it only took one episode for me to be sucked into the story . the star is phenomenal as all of the characters she plays .
this series is only 3 episodes long but the stories are interesting and very well done . we like it that the doctor and the detective finally get together . american series would n't dare do that .
awesome collection ! i am so happy i decided to purchase it . i truly loved north and south . outstanding and more !
on my way to getting the complete collection . ( 4 more to go ) i have been watching the show since i was little on pbs and have always been a fan !
dont remember much actually , but it was a nice change of pace from other comedies . easy to watch but also easy to forget
good movie , a lot of action , a lot of intrigue . plus a very involved plot , interesting . four more words required .
a charming , classic doris day movie . not to be missed ! full of fun , laughs , and rooting for the underdog . well done , amazon , putting this in the prime category !
we are happy with this purchase and look forward to season 3 being available !
chuck norris does a very good acting job in this movie . most of his movies are not very good . this is one of the half dozen well made movies .
foreign movies are entertaining . this one even more so . quirky . do n't know if it was a comedy or a suspense action thriller . but it was really pleasing . not at all boring .
this is one of the most interesting series on television . the characters are believable but not all of them are likable .
it 's friends - where have you been ... ? if you do n't know this show , then you probably need to get this set .
great show . great historical view . it it good to know that post wwii things were a challenge for most people and they still are .
very well done . predictable , but very enjoyable nevertheless . actors all did a very good job . would love to see some kind of sequel .
i remember watching this when i was very young and enjoyed it . this is worthy the time to purchase and get a few laughs , plus you would see were naked gun series started ... .
cute story , will be sure to share it with the grandkids next time we 're together , i 'm sure they will like it also .
i 've wanted to see this for a long time . great great movie . little slower than modern thriller , but well worth the watch !
got the movie , have n't seen it yet , but trust me will do it soon . of course it will be good .
i thought this video was going to go a different direction and once i realized the direction i was worried it would get a little hokey but it actually made a lot of sense .
this is a great feel good movie , jodie foster does a wonderful job of acting . she grows up alone with a family member who obviously made their own language . great ending .
over all a good movie . there is lots of violence that is not as appealing to me as i get older . probably just me . the story line is good and the characters are well developed .
get a job and you & quot ; actors & quot ; need to get a new job too .
this movie was great and all acting was great . the twist was great also . i loved this movie and it is a realistic movie .
the show is very good i recommend it to friends to see it they ll loved it like i do
young guns is an excellent western movie filled with great talented actors who came together and put on a fantastic movie .
this one is top for me . i have watch 'd it over and over .
it was nice to watch an old favorite of mine . i have n't seen it since i was a kid . it arrived in excellent condition and i have no complaints .
watched this long time ago . always get it out on halloween to watch it . each time i watch it its just like the first time , scary .
fun film but difficult to figure out exactly what the point was . lots of violence but no real moral resolution .
this was a great premise for a movie , but the story line fell short . not sure what would have made it better , but i was not very disappointed .
what a wonderful film . very amusing and unique performances from a cast of characters . the plot is very unusual . excellent dress and sets .
it was good . i saw the movie before the play and i liked the movie better . it 's still good enough .
ok , honestly i do not watch this show , however my wife does and loved the season finally so much she just had to own it . she seemed to like it
there are many nice movies that are included in this collection that i remember from years earlier and enjoyed viewing again . some of my favorite actors in these collections .
excellent show ! keeps your attention throughout with an interesting storyline . the lead actress is more than capable of playing all her required roles . i am looking forward to season 2 .
night court is a really funny sitcom and i am glad i found seasons one and two at such a great price .
buy this movie if you have blu ray and you are willing to watch the whole thing . it is terrific .
so glad i purchased the complete series . was a great value price too . the acting is good , scenery great and stories keep you interested .
it 's a fun movie , all elements around of this film give you a great comedy movie , old but good enjoy it
i thought this was a great movie , some really funny parts , some parts that were a little over done , but for the most part a great comedy .
got this gift for my little sister as a present because she loved it so much when we were little . i love that i can find these movies on amazon to help bring back memories
if you like comedies you should get this movie . it 's great ! mel brooks is a genius . a great piece to my movie collection .
this is an above action thriller . it could have cut about a half hour from the beginning , but once it gets going it 's a lot of fun . underrated for sure . i recommend .
very good film with a lot of drama and mystery and some good and bad endings ... full of suspence
the same characters , many years older , doing the same amusing things with each other . if you liked american pie , you 'll like this too .
amy smart is hot in this one and she shows some skin . the humor is excellent , the road trip itself is funny , and the out come for the car is great ! !
not to boring for a foreign gay video but not much to get into if you are looking for a good gay video
my granddaughter loves home alone . i was able to get this set of 4 for less than the price of one dvd . ca n't beat that .
i am hooked ! the scenery , people , and story lines make for great entertainment . if you like ireland you 'll love this series .
i did not watch this my girlfriend did . it was a good movie and clear . the video was quick and no break ups while watching it .
if you are a wolverine fan it was worth seeing but i do n't know if i 'd have purchased as the first movie was so much better .
great movie , great music ! it was a hilarious comedy that any adult or teens can enjoy , however i do think it is inappropriate for small children .
this is a great movie , even tho peter jackson did make some of the scenes a bit too long . still the movie is a keeper .
daniel craig does a great roll in this sci-fi , and harrison ford as well , fantastic special effects . i hope movie makers keep making these kind of movies .
fun , funny , enjoyable , cute and entertaining ! it 's a youngsters first haunted house movie ! it has a touch of scares in it for a little one but more entertaining than anything ! good pick
this is a fantastic movie . i love billy bob in this movie . he is a great actor . i have watched this several times now .
it was every bit as good as the book , very entertaining and not a boring minute during the entire movie .
it was a good example of that era 's science fiction . i grew up viewing these movies and loved them as a youth .
this movie was just as great as the first . you can actually watch this one first and then the watch the first second and still understand . great movie ! ! ! !
my wife and i both love this movie , it definately teaches you that people can change no matter what background they came from
i bought this for my son in law , who had never seen it . no one should go through life without seeing this , one of the best movies ever made !
not a bad movie . it left something to be desired though with the storyline . it seemed just a tad cheesy .
i loved this movie ! excellent acting especially by eastwood . i love a movie with a moving storyline and good morals to the story .
it came extra early came in excellent condition ! i have no complaints this sitcom rules plenty of suspense i would recommend this dvd to anybody !
i love science fiction but this was so poorly done that you were wishing it would be over . can not recommend .
my dear husband is a great fan of all things from historical days . he also enjoys documentaries , many , many of which i have also purchased from amazon.com .
i love all the resident evil movies but this one more and i have watched it over and over the first day i got it
was for my nephew and he loves it watches it almost daily you are asking for to much info . excellent movie
this was definitely worth the money and a hard item to find these days but i am very happy with the purchase
the movie did not disappoint like so many other sequels will do . it was very entertaining and enjoyed it as much as the others .
the only part about this movie that it cut out a certain part of the book .
this spin off of the expendables is loaded with lots of action and comedy . i look forward to the arrival of the expendables 3 and in the out takes video , the new script is already in discussion .
i agree with the one star reviews , by and large . see it on tv if you must - it 's a forgettable film . a silly thriller .
great series on dvd at a great price and arrived on time in great shape . would do business with this seller again .
was good story and a lot of action . explain alot about air wolf . i own all of them now and will watch over and over .
it was the most inspiring movie i have watched . the chosen characters were great for this movie and the fact that everyone song their own parts were brilliant including the storyline
not factual , but a great story even so . lots of suspense and action , my son and i enjoyed this movie immensely .
the characters are well developed and engaging , as is the story line . people who like shows like fringe will like this one as well .
love sandra bullock . these are great movies ... and they were both in one package , too .
fun movie , lots of goofy humor , and ridiculous stuff . lots of fun to watch and they are both great together . great movie
also a gift purchase . these episodes really do hold up . good sound and picture . you will love this collection . great for holiday fun .
it was all in all just a good movie to watch ... kept us entertained , did n't drag on the same theme the whole time
i thought this one was very depressing . did not leave me feeling good about any part of it . i know it is considered a classic but i would not want to watch it again .
great movie - wonderful story . love it in 3d - sharp and clear . this was fun for the whole family !
not good enough for anyone of these actors ! do n't care for this movie ! i would not have done this movie if i was anyone of this actors !
great set . lovable characters . witty , full of laughs for young and old alike . try this and you ( and your kids ? ) will enjoy it .
we saw this movie in the theatres and then bought it for our 7 yr old son for christmas and we all love watching this movie .
just started to watch the good wife and i believe season 3 was the best so far , i started with season 1 , but its not really necessary
pretty awesome indeed . this is a great video to zone out to and everyone i 've watched it with loves it . good times ; - )
this was always a great movie , but bluray brings it to life . get it and keep it forever . i highly recommend this item .
complete junk and waste of time . it is boring . it is uninteresting . starts out cool but after 5 minutes totally loses it .
the bbc has the greatest sci-fi movies and series of all ; this series was a take off of the dr who series . i believe it is off the air now .
predictable but fun . nothing special , glad i did not waste my money at a movie theater but was worth seeing it at home .
my grandsons like this movie a lot . they want to be scared but not too much . i enjoyed watching it with them .
long time fan of this movie and great time to watch this since the 50 year anniversary of this terrible day in american history happen .
an ensemble of talented actors bring to life a nicholas sparks story . does it get any better than this ? i do n't think so .
basically a zombie type of movie . a super way to show the gritty part of older new york city . the characters were great . the monster creatures superb .
it was ok at times , at times the comedy was pretty raw . it took me about half the movie to realize the scenes were set up and people did not realize they were being filmed .
this is the kind of story you remember and go back to over and over ... again and again ... many thanks , bill
great job by ensemble selling the future to us . the storyline was touching . if you can suspend your imagination for entertainment , give this a try , it will be enjoyable nonetheless !
i 'm really enjoying watching the series . i like the main character , and find the drama interesting and thought provoking . hard to stop watching them once i get started .
could n't wait for this to get here and i was n't disappointed . love it and i really ca n't wait to order some more of my favorite old shows .
big fan of the lone ranger ! i remember this series as a kid , i had to have this , for my collection ! great quality dvd , good price !
this was a great price for a great movie . if you have n't seen this one , it is a good movie to pick up for a plane ride .
the person i purchased this for loves it and they said it gets better after the first couple of stories . this person also enjoys cartoon dvds .
not his best but classic time era of a simple american story of what was a real way of life and still is today !
loved the acting , story and the reality of the times . the & # 34 ; rocky & # 34 ; of baseball . all actors were great . emotionally thrilling .
we love this movie . it does have a lot of slap stick comedy , but it is very funny and family friendly .

i am new to this one and i have really enjoyed this show . recommend if you like drama , mystery , & intrigue . well done .

just good old fashion entertainment for everyone to enjoy together when we have our movie nights ... so pop the popcorn and enjoy .
i recently discovered this series on my amazon prime . i have enjoyed every episode . i am up to series 5 and will hate to see it end . i think i will be watching it again .
a movie from my past . i just loved debbie reynolds in this part and the music . this is my kind of movie .
i bought this for my grandson . he wanted the collection so i bought it.it is a great gift set to give to anyone .
an interesting and diverse mix of classic movies from an iconic director all in one package at a great price . good stuff .
worth a watch if you ca n't find another movie . it 's not good or bad . just dull . the movie was slow and drawn out with nothing really happening . boring !
ca n't get enough of iron man . this was a good start to what will be some super movies . i ca n't wit for more of them .
this is a very funny show which should not be watched with small children . the characters are witty and insightful while being comedic . i hope there are a few more seasons .
i was a fan of this cartoon back in the 80 's and i 'm glad to see it finally make it to dvd .
i love this movie . i liked it much better than the original . i think johnny depp is brilliant ! the photography is great and the color is superb !
good acting , but bruce willis is getting old . would n't recommend it to kids . the black and white film noir look is great .
i have really enjoyed the tv program and i am glad to own such a great work in my collection . get it
i loved this in blu-ray . the detail is amazing . the color is sharp . the sound is fantastic , even better with a sound system . this is the only way to view this flick .
i rented this through amazon prime and ended up not paying full attention to it . it was a little boring , and though it had some funny parts , it was a bit disappointing .
one of my favorite christmas movies , tom hanks did an excellent job on this one . certainly will entertain the whole family

i love this series ! i wanted to own all of the dvds to this series . so twilight was the one i needed .
we started watching this show in its third season and wanted to see the series from the beginning . my daughter and i actually turned watching season 1 into an all day marathon .
if you are a survivor fan this is a must see ! too bad there are only a hand full they put on dvd ... .
again this is one of my favorite shows , it is always good fun with no one really getting hurt . always a great show .
a nice family video for all to enjoy . it had everyone from grandpa to the grandkids laughing and enjoying themselves .

something different for a woman . some suspense and surprises . older kids will enjoy watching this movie with mom and dad .
overall who does not love dallas . this good soap opera brings back a lot of memories . love the performances and the plots .

funny and okay for a boring afternoon . i might even watch it again in another 20 years . give it a try !
yep , they tried to throw everything and everyone in here , but the mix just does not work on any level . there are too many killing scenes while there is very little story to balance it .
my grandson is a thomas the train fanatic . of all his thomas movies he likes this one the most so far .
perfect movie for date night . funny and a little romantic . we would recommend this movie to anyone who wants a good laugh
this movie is wonderful . the spirit in johnny is sweet . this movie touched my heart and shows that some people care more about helping others than feeling sorry for themselves all the time

what can you say about the original other than it is creative and ground breaking in special effects and the acting is the best considering many of the stories are adapted from the masters .
my family enjoy watching these movies . i feel they will be watched for many years to come . product arrived good to go . no viewing problems .
jillian gives you her own personal spin on a yoga workout . good for a day you want a workout and want to take it at your own pace

one f the best i have seen , a true movie and a true story of love and appreciation , a must to see
did n't understand reason for movie . should watch it again to try understand it better . anything with mr. holden is usually good .
this was a very funny movie . i laugh at this movie from the time it started until the time it finished .
this film is far superior to the original version , and colin farrell is magnificent ; the action is fantastic , the choreography very well done , and the acting very enjoyable , and the cgi awe inspiring .
i enjoyed this show . i wish there was a third season to be able to tie up some loose ends from the end of the second ( and final ) season .
fun , cute film ! creative great family film , that will keep the adults well entertained !
i laughed a few times but for the most part it 's a stupid movie . i 'm only writing this review to save people their time and money by not watching this terrible flick .
first and favorite horror / ghost movie i saw as a child . loved it . scared me as a child . : )
an adult type movie , it is funny as could be and i enjoyed it , the unrated is not for small kids
very pleased with it . jamie curtis has always been one of my favorite actresses . she is awesome in horror films .
if you 're into action movies , this is not the movie for you . it 's all dialog and slow at times , but overall it was okay .
tommy lee jones and ashley judd were wonderful in this thriller which keeps your interest throughout . this is a thriller with twists that keep you guessing .
this is a wonderful mini series that has a great story line as well as a good cast . it will keep you interested as it has adventure , romance and a little bit of everything interesting .
received as expected . a great film , i can see why it one oscar for best picture . add it to your collection , worth watching more than once .
i have been hooked since season 1 and season 3 did not disappoint . i could n't get to the next episode fast enough after the previous one ended ! !
great ending to a great series . wish it did n't have to end , but this was the only way it could end . thumbs up all the way
there have been several movies made of this classic story . i have n't seen any that i do n't like , but this one is my favorite .
this was a very good movie . i think that the movie drive was inspired by this one . i recommend it if you like car chases .
dated and not very funny . or maybe i am too old to appreciate this movie . of course bill murray is always good .
i really enjoyed this movie . great story line and great music . i immediately downloaded the soundtrack after watching . thoroughly enjoyable .
i am a huge & # 34 ; little house & # 34 ; fan . i was glad that the entire series was released at a reasonable price .
the only reason i bought this movie was to make it easier for me to read the written word and be able to accurately picture the characters and scenes in my minds eye .
i have watched this movie over and over . it 's one that i will pick out to see again and again . the actors play their parts with excitement and makes the movie intriguing at every turn !
i liked every series i 've purchased , and that includes this series . i intend to get series 5 & 6 as well
this movie was as funny as i remember . i love will smith & tommy lee jones . the dvd arrived quickly and was in great condition . thank you !
liam neeson gives another great performance in this movie . the story did not have one dull moment . it 's one of those movies you do n't want to hit the pause button for any reason ! ! !
this is my only 1 star review , so far . i would not recommend this movie . it will put you to sleep . you do not see any of the bible story but rather just hear it .
i purchased this with high hopes but what a waste . the movie was a terrible production that looked like stop action photography .
boring and cheesy . could n't finish it . characters that were boring , hair that looked awkward . it was horrible for so many reasons .
i hate it because i could n't figure out when i ordered it if it was for american or european viewing . i hate it because i have n't figured out a way to view it .
fair movie and it has the twist and turns that makes movies good thats about all .
good movie . just a lot of destruction . a lot . wish there would of been more personal interaction . but a great action flick .
it 's hard to re make a classic . it was good , but really do like the john wayne original one more .
i rented this because basically i had seen everything else . it was a pleasant surprise . nice story and decent acting .
quite possibly the worst film i 've seen in some time . i had to turn it off . i had very high hopes for this as the concept is fantastic . rather poor execution and storytelling .
bought everyone i would start with the first season , then after you have seen them all you can pull out your favs . great cast , shame it was n't on longer .
i watched this movie today and it was great i love james bond movies now i 'm working on the next james bond roger moore
nothing out of the ordinary if you know anything about world war 2 and hitler . acting could have been much better but it fell flat for me .
this movie left you on the edge of your seats . the actors were fantastic and the movie was full of drama . i would recommend this movie to anybody .
it was really quite a good show . it 's one of those shows where the setting is almost a character in addition to all of the human characters .
and loved the story line . of course , most people have probably seen this by now , but we really enjoyed it . it was a good date night for us over dinner at home !
i 've been looking for this many years & it was better than the first time i saw it 30 years ago .
has comedy , a good story line , and a good tear jerker ( not that i cried but was about to : ) ) have to see its very good
it was a bit predictable but overall it was funny . i 'm not sure if i would recommend it over some other coming of age films .
this was a wonderful video . my granddaughter loved the music and the farm animals and loved singing along with the songs . this was fun and entertaining .
very enjoyable movie and even though i had seen it before in the theater . i would recommend this movie to my friends .
i had to get all the seasons of everybody loves raymond , they are so funny , i watch them often with my kids , with some pop corn . great times . thank you

robert downey jr. real play the part of holmes he did an outstanding job on the roles plus he is in my top ten i would pay to see ... .
its ok. with the cast that it has , it 's pretty hard to go wrong . it is a good way to spend some extra time .
it put me to sleep ... not the worst movie i 've ever seen . just does n't hold up to the original judge dredd .
i love this movie , it has great actors in it , and it shows how happy you can be at anytime when you have songs in your heart . great love story too

it 's rare that a sequel matches the original , and this one does n't . however , it was still a good tale , funny , and worth watching .

product was received in timely manner , and proved to be very enjoyable viewing .
i had an absolute perfect experience all around . great product , brings back a lot of memories ! ! thank you very much !
it 's a fun romantic comedy with an unusual story line . some good laughs . makes you believe there is the sweet boy next door kind out there for a girl to fall in love with .
kind of corny , but what a happy film ! have watched it at least 3 times and although the story is somewhat lame , the performances are incredibly talented !
this is worth purchasing even if you have seen some or all of the movies previously . the price is right , and it 's fun to rewatch old friends from the past .
not quite as good and funny as the live show , but still one of the best superhero cartoons i 've seen , if you like them quirky .
this is one of my favorite of steven seagal films , the sound is improved and the picture quality is improved .
this movie was quite hilarious . it is a good movie to watch when you want a good comedy . i would definitely recommend it

i have been a fan since the first season , the writers are great and the cast are so wonderful i love them .
clint is great in this , but not in the usual way . he becomes endearing and the ending is a great twist on things .
for me it was just ok , it did n't seem like a bourne movie without matt damon . the plot was ok in keeping with the other movies but it just did n't flow for me .
i just now started getting into this show . great show ! great price . i know it will be a keeper for years to come .
some people do n't like it but it 's one of my favorite movies . dialogue humor not slapstick comedy type . great buy

i love this series ! so different and lots of fun twists ! this is one of the few tv series that my husband and i both agree on !
we have all of the seasons of murder , she wrote and just love angela lansbury in this series . she is a superb actress .
it 's okay , and definitely predictable , but had some good moments . for sure you can compare it to & # 34 ; the matrix & # 34 ; movies .
did you notice that most people that gave this movie ( and titanic ) 5 stars , are women ? makes ya think , do n't it ?
a great old show to share with the kids . it 's always nice to find a show that both the adults and the children in the household can enjoy together ... good clean funny show !
iron man 2 was very entertaining and kept you interested . it was action packed with good acting on all parts . i enjoyed it it as much as my grand kids did .
this movie caught me off guard a little . it was a humor but was much more dark than expected . i really liked it , spacey is the man .
i remember growing up watching this and wanted to get it for my nephew ! i love it ! the packaging was great got it new !

this is a cool series for our young generation . i love star wars so i am biased , but this series compliment the new movies .

i loved this movie so much , i seen it when i was younger as i was growing up and i cant get enough
this is an oldie but goodie and would recommend this to anyone who loves old movies its a bit corny now but still funny
this is a bunch of terrible movies , no fx , no producers no directors , 8 is the number and 8 terrible trash movies are here ... do not buy do not rent forget it ... bad bad movies
i found this very entertaining . tom hanks does not disappoint , nor do the other actors . excellent rainy day and popcorn movie .
good action movie for an older set , not over the top but good viewing . i like this type of movie .

this movie shows what drugs , adult book stores and dvd places can do to our young people . great movie . have watched it twice and at least 5 times before .
i fell in love with this series after watching a couple of episodes on tv and i had to get it on dvd ! !
this movie was pretty funny for what its intended purpose was . the main character is way over the top stupid but it fits the movie . there is crap load of blood though .
great escape movie when you you just want to see a lot of action .
i enjoy watching this movie over and over again . it has such a great family , christmas message . i will recomend this movie to everyone .
we all enjoyed it . it was not just funny for the kids . the adults enjoyed it also . it was fun !
a very entertaining film nicely remastered and uncut . an enjoyable commentary by the director and a very nice interview with the two leads .
i enjoyed this movie for a one time viewing . it was hard to watch , but entertaining . have not watched it again and probably will not .
this is a really good workout . however , i am very out of shape and need to work up to doing it . i 'm looking forward to that point when i can keep up ! !
absolutely terrible movie . at least it was relatively short . i watched the whole thing , thinking it had to get better . it did n't .
standard bond fare with few new plot twists . starts some new faces as standard characters but that is not enough to overcome a weak plot !
thought it was great ! loved everyone in the cast . will watch it again . [ probably a lot over time . ]
if you 're a star trek fan , you 'll like this movie . a few twists and turns and the dialog is actually interesting . great entertainment
i enjoyed this rendition of my favorite monster , godzilla . it was very enjoyable because so many other monsters were part of the destruction . i would definitely buy it again .
great story ! incredible cast of actors and characters . absolutely love this series . waiting for season four to come to amazon .
what a great & # 34 ; international intrigue & # 34 ; thriller ! as de niro is terrific ( as usual ) with a great supporting cast , this fast-paced thriller is highly recommended .
this is one of the few films i 'd call perfect . it gets everything right . buy it . right now . you will not regret it .
i really enjoyed watching this movie so much i watched it several times . i am always amazed at how far a person 's faith will take them . loved the mother in this film !
tony curtis surprisingly at his best . loved the period in which this film was filmed in . a cult classic to be sure
you can not go wrong with a good james bond movie . 007 is a classic and i think daniel craig does a good bond .
this is a good movie , i would recommend it to everyone to watch . i am having movie nights with neighbors .
this movie was fun to watch and was very entertaining . i loved the 3d features too . the story line is not perfect but overall is worth the money .
another great movie by a great cast of actors were very good . better than the book ! yet another to watch many times .
it is a very good action movie . i like stephen baldwin . i have watched this movie multiple times . i recommend this movie .
i really like this movie . keanu reeves and sandra bullock are very good in this film . it is exciting , suspenseful , and action-packed .
matt damon is matt damon . this flick is not close to the damon films , but not bad . worth watching if just to compare .
then look no further , here it is . acting was great , sometimes funny then a bit mysterious . see this now if you can ? that is if you can even see it !
nothing better to laugh with jennifer aniston . i think she did a great job in this comedy . supporting actors as well .
two unlikely people in this weird story line . i like quirky stories and enjoyed this movie . hope you do also .
the movie had no sound at all . very disappointing to watch . would n't buy this one at all . too bad as it looked like a good fred astaire movie .
watched this movie before reading the love dare book . both go hand in hand in keeping a good marriage for life .
the description was accurate , it was a thriller , action packed , and it kept you guessing . terrific movie , all the way through . would watch again .
this movie was okay , a good start and the ending was very good , the middle was very believable and it leaves room for a part ii if there was one to come out .
great movie but the original was much better . if you like action then this movie is for you . the only thing lacking were the special effects and futuristic world depicted in the original
i bought this and gave it as a present and she loved it ! she said it was just as she remembered !
the last in this series ! is as good as the other 3 and am happy i have it .
although i saw this many years ago when i was younger it is still a great movie and a real classic one all can enjoy for a long time to come
do you want to see why agent k is so quiet ? do you want to see what agent j would do for his partner ? then buy this movie and find out for yourself .
i saw this movie in the theater twice ... i saw it many many more times now that i have it on dvd . the special effects are incredible , and it has an overall more than excellent plot .
as enjoyable as the first time i saw it in the movie theater ; it was a good buy . thank you .
i found the second season rather boring and repetitive . there are no new ideas . my wife and i stopped watching after the third disk .
an okay movie ... good story ... but slow paced . the action is there , the actors are all good , but i have seen better movies of this kind . all in all , an okay film .
harry potter movies are excellent . now i have all the movies . i highly recommend to anyone who loves harry potter .
this is a good well acted show with lots of action . i usually watch 3 or 4 episodes per day .
this movie still holds up after decades . great storytelling and so well-made . fabulous acting , including bits by holly hunter and others . worth watching again and again .
shame on all of these talented actors ! all of you should have turned down the script ! what a waste of time !
dvd came as expected . a+ ! shipped well daughter enjoyed it as she has been waiting until disney would re release it and so i was glad to find it . thank you .
i have loved this movie since it first came out . its fun and very enjoyable . not heavy , light and fun . an old stand by movie to watch .
no problems with my discs . ca n't wait for season 3 ! ! !
this movie rocks ! ! ! ! ! ! . it was made with good director , actors and story line . i love scooby doo !
have season 1 and loved it so much i had to get season 2. great dvds with excellent actors . each episode is uncut just like when each was first aired .
this movie was stupid funny . it was what i expected . it was sooooo silly , but fun . i enjoyed the movie .
this is not an award winning movie . the plot is week , the acting is not award winning , but it is a fun girls night movies .
i bought this so would have a complete set as much as possible to go along with the video games that i currently have
i did not read the book but i found the movie very interesting and lots of fun to watch . peace
we all loved the movie . almost like the book . ca n't wait tell the other two books are made into movies .
i bought it because i used to work with one of the actors . it 's cheap and terrible , but in a good way .
love this show ! ca n't wait for another season . love the way carrie can remember everything ! the way the other characters interact is so entertaining .
great movies . they will give you a laugh if you have n't seen them . if you have , they are great for a lazy movie day .
this is a very interesting series we 've just started watching with the family . ca n't wait to catch up on the series !
great back story to the alien saga . breath taking visuals and fantastic acting . looking forward to seeing where this story leads .
this film keeps you laughing from beginning to end . for a fun film not for the whole family there are some adult moments and comments . i 'd rate it as pg
this guy will eat you up . one of the best . unbelievable , must read you must judge for yourself , but i highly recommend it . one two three four five six seven eight . nine ! !
being as tracy herself just had a baby she was inspired to make this workout . her moves are very unique and this workout will leave you feeling like you are really making some changes in your body .
after the years since the series was first produced it still pulls you in . i got hooked on the people and their lives . great entertainment .
shall ? set you free and sometimes that it what we all need to here the hard down to earth hart felt truth
the naruto series is a very middle of the line story of a boy wanting to gain respect and feel needed , the kids & i enjoyed the series very much .
i love this series and this season is great . some new faces but it does n't take away from the comedy
lovely film ... makes you happy and sad . strange fairy tale in modern times . nice to see a film that children and adults can enjoy seeing together
i really did not like it neither did my wife it was not what we thought . did not like the plot .
this movie was ok. it is not as good as the original but it was pretty good . it is not as bad as every one said it was . hope this helps someone .
loved this movie , if you need a good laugh , watch this movie . wonderful cast . wish there was a part two .
this is a really great movie ! full action packed , and even though its an older movie , its still one of the best . i would recommend this to anyone who likes action movies .
good photography and scenery , but weak on plot and action . not one of sandra bullock 's best .
i really enjoy this new series of the star trek movies . the actors are perfect for the parts they play and the story and action are excellent !
love this series ! if you are an x files fan then this is a show for you . dark and creepy .
common plot but the singing was well worth it ! reminded me of cher 's tv specials and a lot like all that jazz . very , very entertaining .
george burns singing the beatles ... how can you not get a kick out of that ?
i am enthralled with this program . it 's so & # 34 ; everyday & # 34 ; and i thoroughly enjoy it . are more seasons planned ? please say yes !
again this is a great movies from the 80 's good entertainment and it is fun to watch . love tom selleck
this movie was too violent to let our whole family watch , we have children as young as 6 ; better for adults but not the best superman movie we have watched .
perhaps i did n't give it a fair chance by getting beyond the filming of this movie , but cinematography is an important element in movie making as it sets the mood .
set of john wayne dvds was in like new condition , arrived promptly , well packed , what can i say ? what 's to complain . i would highly recommend this vendor based on my experience .
i had heard of this movie for years , but had never seen it . i thought it was going to be boring , but it was n't . just interesting enough to keep you watching .
this was a gift to a friend who enjoys british comedies . i thought when purchased that it was some series from the bbc , but turned out to be four separate films of british humor .
these are two very good movies and i highly recommend them . they would be great for a family movie night !
boring and the story line was terrible . they could have done a better job with the story line than they did
love watching this episodes . loved the special features too . loved the action of the show and the suspense in the show
had to have this one we borrowed it from my son 's collection and just had to have for ourselves . excellent movie .
here 's another christmas dvd must have . i love this movie and watch it over and over ( even when it 's not christmas ) .
it was ok to pass the time with but i will not get any more of this series . got a little boring .
ca n't wait for this season ! and 6 & 7 ! ! mary only got better with time and i ca n't wait to see these seasons again ! ! ! !
this was great ! perfect price ... . and perfect movie ! ! ! ca n't get much better than that ! my family loved it , we watched it all the night we got it !
i love this movie i have been waiting for it to hit dvd for a while im glad to have it and we will do more business soon
this is my old time favorite . creepy , dark stuff . this still scares me after all these years . love this stuff .
i was excited to hear the series was coming out in dvd then i too was disappointed that the series was n't . what gives only 4 episodes what happen to the other 18 ? ?
unfortunately i have not watched it yet , but it was a must have since we enjoyed the first expendables . will have to update once we watch it .
i liked this movie . it was different than the first original but it showed a more in touch and not so dumb peter parker .
i love the lord of the rings movies , and very much enjoy the special editions . it looks amazing in blu-ray
i am glad i bought this . i have all of nicholas sparks works . this just added to my big collection .
one of the better star trek series . i watched some of the others , but could never get into them much .
typical sequel , not as good as the first , by far , but fans of the original will enjoy the action . harder to follow storyline than original , but great characters and touching moments .
i watched these movies , one and two - once and that was enough for me . sorry , not a fan of these movies , but my husband is and he was thrilled with it .
this is an excellent movie and one of the best suspense movies i have seen . i very much recommend this to anyone liking this sort of genre !
i love pooh so much , i was so excited to have them bring him back like i remember from my childhood !
i have owned this on dvd one of the best vampire animes ever made and i think the bluray is great on my 60 & # 34 ; .
i thought it was a great price for all 4 movies . and my boys loved getting it for christmas . as always , service was excellent with amazon .
a pair of my favorite actors , doing there best type of role , they really made a good movie with this one .
this movie is adorable ! the acting is good , the quality of the dvd is good . i love a good musical . this hit the spot .
always have time for frank no matter what the subject . ca n't wait for 'the naked runner ' to be released on dvd . must be one of the best spy thrillers ever made .
i enjoyed this movie , but there is an entirely unexpected turn of events in the story . it 's a shame because they had the elements of a good mystery , but took the easy way out .
it was wonderful to view this film again . it brought back memories as a child watching this on tv with my mother and sister . i 'm glad i made the purchase .
this is one of my favorite dvds that i have ever watched . this video had some of the best matches though the years .
love the dvd great movie brought for my daughter who is starting to like classic movies especially musical she enjoy them
had its funny moments , but overall , it was kinda gross - and not that funny as a result - i 'm not offended , just was not as entertained as i thought it would be
this is a great movie , two people trying to allow themselves to fall in love with each other . i think the world needs more love stories like this with two great actors . great chemistry .
for those who enjoyed reading the beloved novel , the cinematic version does it justice . very enjoyable , suspenseful , and fast-paced flick .
somewhere in time will take the viewer back to a time of innocence which we may never know .
grimm is one of the coolest tv shows , its supernatural with the twist , i love this show . if your a fan of supernatural this show is for you .
kyra and the rest of the cast gave very good performances . it was interesting to watch the characters evolve . the closer quickly became my favorite television show .
being a horror fan i really loved this twin pack , both movies where different and worthy of being in my collection .
very good remake of the remake , the second one made from the classic original 50s sci fi , lots of scary moments and wild effects , one awsome monster movies with a super cool ending ...
the first couple of movies were ok but the last four were really awful they were not even scary just bad !
this was a great movie ! i love all the riddick movies , and i really liked this one ! and i loved that it kept with the story line too
really funny movie i had heard it was not any good . but they were wrong do not recommend for kids .
my wife is a big christmas movie nut . it was nice to be able to purchase a single episode from a television show she enjoyed with our children when they were little .
watching these old shows always brings a smile to my face . i am glad i got a couple of seasons .
i want to take a trip like this ... italy is high on the list of countries in which to do it ! ! !
i first watched this on a cold december day when i had nothing else to do . i went on netflix and found this . sooo fun ! it is my favorite holiday movie ever !
i have not seen this is a gift for m y parents as they are house bound & they love all animal movies so am sure they will love this one !
previews were better than this movie . i was kind of lost with the back story and this was way to far of a reach for her to play this part .
very interesting premise . jason played it just right , again . i had to add this to my jason statham collection . worth buying .
i 've heard no complaints or negative comments from the recipient so i have to assume that this should be rated high .
i do n't care how old you are this movie is for skill ages ... children , adult , of people . this movie makes you feel great . enjoy viewing it ! !
this movie is very cute one , our kids like them . dvd is good condition too . thank you and have a good day friends ! !
this was a great series . wish there had been more . television was much better back then .
i never seen this before i bought it and i watched it and it was a very great dvd and im very happy that i bought it.i recommend it
after watching a couple of the series i finally remembered this when it was on tv . a good series and somewhat realistic .
good product . i like it . good dvd . good actors . good . good . good . good . good . good . good . good ! !
however this is one of those super hero movies that little boys love and will watch over and over . purchased as a gift for my 11 year old son .
this dvd was cute and interesting . i thought it was just as good as the 1st one was and would recommend it to anyone who has seen the first one .
good movie , seen it several years ago and wanted to own it so i bought it and was glad i did .
its great . my husband will rewatch it over and over . for fathers day bought him the whole thing ... all seasons !
i really love this show ... its one of my favorites and it is one of the first animes ive ever watched . the storyline is so unique .
this is a super and beautifully filmed saga of all things indian . do watch it even if you have no particular interest in india you will have after viewing this video .
i never got to see this at the theater so i bought it and was not disappointed ! a very entertaining , funny , heart-warming movie !
this was bought for my brother . not sure if he 's gotten to it yet , but i 've heard that it 's a good series .
no problems buying used products , everything about this purchase was just great . i highly recommend buying like this to all my friends .
i laugh through this whole movie ! what a great combination of actors to act in a movie that is enjoyable .
i have watched this movie time and time again . will continue to watch it . it is just that good . buy it .
this it fun for star trek fans and those that are not . in our family we have both and we enjoyed watching it together .
so my wife did n't like it as much as i did , it was a great movie and i will watch it over and over again . i 'm looking forward to getting the second one .
this was a great dvd as it was based on a true story . i enjoyed it as well as other family members enjoyed it .
i love sandra and george but i was n't a fan of this movie . i 'm happy i rented it first before buying it ! !
i guess i am a kid at heart but i always enjoy watching these shows even though i have seen them before .
this was for my son and he likes it very much . he watches them over and over , basic family fun .
great movie at a great price . if you like classic westerns this movie is for you . has some of the great western movie stars of all time
a love movie that i like very much , it is also a sad movie but the message in it is amazing
they do n't make them like this anymore . funny and with some of top actors for the project . had to add to my personal collection . would suggest you do like wise .
this is one of those movies that you have to watch to the end and discover for yourself what you believe and do n't believe , just watch !
i did not like anything about this show and i will not watch it again . i found it offensive and trite .
i have watched and enjoyed this product . it is exactly what i was looking for . will look for more related dvd 's .
this two actors seem to be made for each other . lots of good acting and humor . so buy is soon .
i loved this movie when it first came out , and i still watch it time to time . no animated movie will be better than this , in my opinion .
very good version of the story , goes great with the new film by jobs . i recommend buying the two films
it 's a stephen king adaptation . how can you go wrong ? these are a little on the silly side , but that 's the best part .
i am still amazed every time i watch this movie . the effects are fantastic and the acting amazing . top that off with a fun plot and this movie is still a must buy .
this is a great older horror movie . very suspensful ! i would reccomend this to anyone who likes psycho , birds , or any other older scary movie .
thought it would be a good series but i was wrong , i really did not like it i gave it away
this was a great adaptation of the book with great acting and all in its original setting . the ending is perfect .
i love this type movie , it is fun , romantic and a great way to see some of italy . it is like traveling and never leaving your home .
fun , crazy movie . all the adults in our family thought it super funny , very entertaining . this is definitely not for children , i 'd say no one under 18 .
i am a huge scooby-doo fan , so loved this box set . i was a little confused why the third season was different that the first two in title sequence . there are great special features .
my collection of musicals will never be complete until this very entertaining favorite is released in dvd widescreen . ( hint , hint ! )
this is such a nice movie that i wish everyone would watch it at least once . i 'm sure we would judge people less just knowing we all have a past .
i bought this dvd because i have enjoyed his previous dvds , however , i was disappointed . this is by no means as funny as his other dvds . this fell flat with everyone in my home .
an easy way to work out and get in shape areas for people who are over 50 years old and want to work out
i was very happy with how quickly i received this item and it was new so there was nothing to worry about , like it being scratched and such . thank you very much .
the product was everything that the seller said it would be . it arrived pretty quickly too . i am very satisfied ...
great cast , fun spoof . it kept our interest all during the movie . some was silly , but it was fun anyway .
an older western with harrison ford that is also a comedy ! plenty of laughs and fun while viewing this movie !
too long and out dated . the ending was the best and probably the most famous part . worth waiting for it .
watched for a few minutes and just felt depressed and bored . no excitement here ... just blah . would not recommend this to anyone .
since i started watching fringe , i loved it and decided that i had to own all the episodes . this was # 4 of 4 .
i found this movie to be better then the first one . i hope there will be more .
i bought this movie ( did n't read the preview ) was expecting to get some lord nelson action but not in this one .
this is a movie that grows on you each time you watch it . the little ones enjoy it because there is just enough silliness to make it funny .
i have been a bones fan since the series first aired . every season gets better and better . looking forward to many more !
the first time i saw mad max was back in the mid 90s . but today , on blu-ray , incredible . what a trilogy to watch
if you want to update your martial art collection buy this dvd . its action packed with high flying acts and kicks .
what a fabulous movie . it makes me feel like a little mouse . it was all that back in the day .
happy to get the series . would recommend you to others . proud to give this set as a gift . great shape
this is an excellent movie ! dancing is great ! story is great ! actors are great ! loved it ! one of my favorite movies .
its okay . i like cartoons , all of them . this one took the stargate story further , a bit over the top as far as cartoons go . but that is what you get with morality plays
he still can sing and the group had many hits . if you were a fan back in the 60 's you wo n't be disappointed .
not what i expected . suppose to have comedy in it , but i thought it was dull and boring . pretty disappointed in the movie .
this has been and always will be a favorite hitchcock film . i still think it is a very good movie .
then i watched it again and it was just okay . i lost interest mid way but i love jeremy renner and that kept me through for the rest of the movie .
love how all the detectives get along and have each others back . it has a good crime stories , also combines some humor .
great movie . a bit dated now but if you can get past that very funny and original at the time .
i just love this hbo series ... i would recommend to anyone who has n't watched it ... it 's a must to see this series ...
we enjoyed watching it for our dinner and a movie . it was full of entertainment . we stayed awake ! you 'll like it too .
the story itself has been done many times and really needed more work . however they did make some interesting twists . the acting was quite good .
i wish they made more movies like these nowadays ... it is simple enough to watch , but unique enough to be memorable !
i was pleasantly surprise i enjoyed the movie so much . good cast of actors to carry on the star trek story .
this has a great case . a really good movie so i decided to buy it & add it to my library .
i love this movie it really gets you right there . i have been trying to buy the dvd hd for sometime . acting is exceptional and story is excellent .
this is a great version of the movie . if you 're a fan of the movie then you should definitely get this one .
very good dvd , good matches , great moments could have been longer would have made it a little better but a great purchase none the less
i have watched this movie many times is he or is he not real and what is the point of the movie watch closely and you might discover there is more to life
the movie stayed very close to the book and made the characters come alive for me . i would recommend this dvd .
i enjoy this movie ... but it 's my sister 's favorite christmas movie ... so i bought it for her ... for christmas , so i have to wait to see it .
the kids loved it as much as we did when we were children ! wonderful story and a great message . classic disney .
beautiful ! the cast of characters were excellent . full of faith and inspiration . a must see for families . i highly recomended
this is a great family movie . the movie streamed well , and the video quality was great . i would watch it again !
i went to the movies and saw this film and enjoyed it . it was a fun movie to watch and i would recommend it to anyone .
this is in excellent condition and arrived in a timely manner ! thank you so much . : )
it 's hard to remember just how ground breaking this show was . it 's aged very well , still one of the best !
i remember this from saturday morning television growing up . it all very campy now , but back then it was great stuff ... morality plays set in the future
great movie . its my personal favorite and was my sons until the new version with andrew garfield . i 'd definitely recommend it .
was n't great . not really a fan . could n't tell if it was a spoof or if it was for real .
the special effects and the concept of dreams within dreams make this a visual delight . it 's a movie you could watch again and again .
i was glad to find this dvd -- it is quite the same as the books , and very enjoyable . i will watch it many times with pleasure .
... the writers of lost throw in more turns and twists that keep you hooked ! love this show and will be sorry when i 've watched all episodes from all seasons .
pretty good movie . as good as the book in my opinion . at least it wasnt as scary as i was afraid it might be .
it took me some time to figure the plot out on this movie . it has it 's moments . some of my kids liked it some did not .
ever seen blair witch ? or , how about the office ? like that , but more gross
i wish they 'd get red john and continue on with other storylines . simon baker is very interesting to watch . he 's like one of the guys with a gift .
this is a movie trying to be scarey and it just quite does n't make it , but watchable for an old movie .
i 've been a fan since they first aired and i 'm thrilled to have found them here for a very good price .
this is one of the best movies from the early 80 's regarding disney studios . funny and dramatic . it 's a little corny but worth purchasing . everyone 's performance is great .
this isnt one of her best , but its still filled with great lines . get im no angel first , then watch this one .
i have yet to view this movie , but based on the quality of the stars , i am sure i will enjoy it .
i enjoyed this movie a lot . its funny and its just a great fun movie to watch . this movie definately have me wanting to watch more of jack black movies .
this dvd collection has provided hours of entertainment for my family . my family have watched these and enjoy remembering the good old days . the dvd was an excellent choice and the actors top notch .
i gave this as a gift and have not watched it since purchased . i saw it once before and i am sure will again a bargain with the included digital copy
i grew up with andy griffith show ! ! i enjoyed each show for the morals they share ! ! a must see , for each season ! !
saw the movie in the theater , loved it and the music is awesome ... ... knew i wanted to own it for myself .
the acting was less than stellar to say the least . very stiff all the way around . the plot was average . i would n't waste your money on this one .
didnt think i was going to like this but as soon as her mom turned into a bear i couldnt stop laughing
my husband likes old war movies , so i purchased this for him . neither one of us had ever heard of it . he really liked this movie .
i just love this series . for some reason i did n't discover the show until this year so i went back to season 1 .
all this movie is a feel good movie for all ! ! ! i liked big brother looking after little brother in the movie !
what can i say : this is one of the best films , ever . it 's a must in everyone 's dvd collection ! rock on , wayne !
gary cooper ; one of my favorite all time actors who i watch every chance i get . such a good historical movie ; get it .
i gave it five stars because it was an interesting movie of survival . overall a good movie to watch on a rainy night .
what a terrible movie . academy award ? what ? ! this was so boring i could n't finish it and i sold it right away .
i first watched the `` toy story '' about four months ago . i enjoyed it so much i went out and bought all them of the `` toy story movies '' .
like most ghost movies but some scenes are a bit different . this made the movie stand out more from the rest of the movies .
great , great comedy loved every minute of the season . we are looking forward to seeing the rest of the shows .
this is a british film an intriguing plot i saw it many years ago and finally found and bought it . it is is as good if not better then before .
not only acting and directing this movie was great , but the story was very captivating as well . it haunted me for a week .
this one michael myers returns , we purchased because we love the movies and wanted to have the whole collection recommend highly
if love the series you will love this . got what i paid for in great time from a great place .
good movie more of these kinds of movies should be made , true life stories i enjoy . so informative of the situations of many children around the world
it does n't live up to the stunts that were performed in 1 & 2 . yet all that battle came to a satisfying end in an unlikely manner which made the movie ... '' still good ''
great show , every interesting episodes , great for the entire family . exciting episodes , wo n't be disappointed . order now . excellent cast ; ;
i would have never watched this on my own . just don ; t care for westerns but this turned out to be excellent and i 've watched several times now . it was awesome .
this is a great dvd . i love the girls and it just adds to how cool they are .
this is one of those movies you can watch over and over . wonderful acting , good story . have already watched it several times .

i do n't have much to say about these movies if ur a fan of the halloween movies u 'll enjoy them .
i love this movie i remember watching it when i was a teen i could n't wait for the next episodes to watch it is really entertaining true story .
a good finished to the series laugh my head off wish it did n't have to end but enjoy all of them
my 9 and 4 year olds both love scooby doo . it is hard to find something they both like ! some scenes are a bit scary for the 4 year old
clint eastwood is always fun to watch and always has some great lines , but this was just a weak and pathetic movie .
best one put out by disney since beauty and the beast . i find it superior animation and great for family viewing .
this is one of the most awesome movies i 've seen in a long , long time !
wesley snipes is like a super hero in this film , different kind of hero with a whole of action , and martial arts fighting ! !
awesome older movie that never gets old no matter how many times you watch it . hard to find in stores but you can order and receive in just a few days from amazon .
i could not wait to watch the next show . this series is good clean entertainment . i really wished it had not ended .
dvd in excellent condition , as advertised . movie is kind of weak , but it is michael moore 's first effort ! worth owning .
i enjoyed this movie and would recommend it . if you liked the trailer , you will like the movie . better than i expected .
i love alfred hitchcock and no one can top him ! i am so pleased to add this to my large collection of the great alfred hitchcock ! : )
good combination of action , suspense and relationships portrayed in this series . we really like the actors and the way they play off of each other
have been looking for a while for this movie but could n't remember the name , can watch on a regular basis
got this for my son for his birthday , he loves it . it works as expected . thanks we appreciate that its good .
purchased viewing rights to this movie as it 's a favorite with my grandsons from ages 8 to ? ? ? ? humor throughout .
tom hanks can do anything , and he made a great movie here . actors do a good job of singing the soundtrack .
my daughter loved this movie ! she and my wife watched it while her boyfriend was away out of state and she was missing him .
i have seasons 1 thru 4. i have to buy 5. the picture is beautiful on my sony blu-ray player . its a great investment .
this is a great old movie far ahead of its time . would recommend it to any sci-fi fan .
i 'd never seen this movie from start to finish . now that i 've seen it in context it 's funny , classic robert downey , jr. where in the world is val kilmer these days ?
i enjoyed the movie but mostly bought it for someone else , so i watched it too . anthony quinn is really good in the movie .
i needed a different view to understand a friends perspective . i needed to see through his eyes . this film helped .
this is a great dvd with much action . i would suggest if you like action get this dvd you will like it .
this was a gift for my wife . she has long been a fan of the hobbit stories and books so this was a great treat for her . she and i both loved the movie .
i thought it was a very good movie and i have never seen it before buying it and i am happy i did .
this was a gift for mother . she loved it . nothing com complain about . nice package and no scratches on dvd . thanks for the on time delivery . it was a special day for my mother .

bought this on black friday for a great deal ... prior to ever seeing the movie before . but it is very cute ! fun story and great animation .
this has to be the best movie i 've seen in a long time ! why ca n't they come out with more movies this good ?
i 've seen this a couple times and laugh alot . john m is just great . ca n't wait to see red 2
this is one of my favorites . it 's packed with action but does n't take itself too seriously ! seriously great movie if you 're into action and ridiculous humor : d
i just wan na say that all films in this set looks great on blu-ray , but i really wish all of these were the director 's cuts .
this was the funniest movie i have watched in quite some time ... . this was such an amazing movie this is a movie you can watch over and over again .
this is a pretty good story movie , most of the stories in it are pretty scary and not boring , i always enjoy watching it .
great movie on of the best of all times , great acting and a great story all combine for a great movie .
like all of elizabeth taylor 's movies , this is a great movie . it 's hard to think someone so beautiful can act so ugly . i loved it !
if you just want to fill in some time , this movie will do it , but i did n't really care for the show .
i have been a fan of this show since forever . my daughter and i love watching these reruns ! ca n't wait to order the rest of the available seasons !
such a sweet story . i have never cried so much over a movie in my life . i am not sure how children would get through this one .
i have season one to season four of fresh prince . now i just bought season 5 and continued watching will smith comedy of fresh prince .
i never had the chance to see this movie when it came out , but now i 'm sure glad i did get it . it was worth the buy .
i like good old movies . had always heard about it but this if the first time i have ever seen it .
for these two actors , i thought this was very boring , but then maybe i just was n't in the mood that day . will give it another chance at a later date .
nice move will watch it more this year as never tire of watching christmas movies all year round just love christmas
i think my husband and i watched about 10 minutes of this before turning it off . terrible movie would not recommend for anyone .
one of my favorite tom cruise movies . my son is 15 and at some point i want him to see this movie .
i love this show . i wish it lasted longer . its funny , sad , awkward , emotional , happy and suspensful all at once !
i could n't get some of the audio settings to work on the bluray on my player which was disappointing . the music was ok , but i 'm afraid to say it 's nothing special .
very funny video . good character interplay . hillarious songs . moral values shines through all the silliness . good for any time of the year . highly recommended for children of any age .
well so much for everything i loved as a kid being as good today . this `` documentary '' is very funny now and the stories it tells are beyond belief . worth a look for the laughs .
great movie if you 're a horse person - fair acting and it does tell the story of a great horse .
a cheap production with worse sets and worse still the dialogue . i watched at the most 10 minutes before i gave up . ugh ! !
personally , i thought it was very dry . it is a cartoon and funny in parts , but it is not a johnny depp film . i did not even finish it all the way through .
this movie was not exactly what i had expected . while it was ok i would not pay to see it again .
my dad loves this movie . i have n't watched it yet , but my dad keeps giving me good reviews from it .
it does n't get any better . the best spiderman movie yet . great script . great cast . excellent direction . good music . good job by all involved .
i have not watched this movie yet , but i have watched the movie before , thus my reason for purchase . with luck i will not have issue when i fire it up on the blu-ray player .
this was a very entertaining movie for both my grandchildren , my children and myself . it works for numerous generations . it can easily be enjoyed when watching it more than once .
this is one of my favorite movies and to have both in one box is so great ! i am so glad it was available that way .
if you like the oldies then this is a good collection for you ! she does some great performances in these 4 movies and you will enjoy them .
this one held our interest from start to finish . very nice story line , with lots of human interest and action .
it was ok as a movie goes but not what i would want to watch again . the ending kind of left you wondering about how they ended it .
i love this series it is one of my favorite shows of all time ! i am glad to see that this is now on dvd ! great picture quality !
i have loved this movie since i was a kid so will you and your kids .
this movie is on dvd . amazon just needs to get with the program .
i think that it was really good and i recommend to buy it ! i stayed up all night and watched cause i wanted to see what happened next .
this is one of the best movies i have ever seen . everyone should see this movie . this movie will change the minds of many people
very pleased with the quality of this dvd . used products are generally not in very good condition . will continue to buy from this seller in the future .
loved the characters , loved the stories , hated to see this end . i would encourage everyone to watch this series soon .
this was funny . i found it very entertaining and the perfect , no thinking , escape from reality . i recommend it for laughs .
i was n't even born yet when this was filmed ... but my heart is in the older movies . they are so wonderful .
do n't waste your time & $ . this movie was a boring drama . there 's no exciting scenes or good dancing . the plot is way stupid .
me and my grandson liked this move very well . we went to the movies to see it and then watched it on amazon prime .
this is just too weird for words ... . i did n't care for it . more wasted money . i hate movie theaters , but wish i had rented this one from the library .
most of the episodes were fine - but a few were lacking in real content . the characters were well cast .
this movie was great . the action , the suspense , that acting all came together in a great way to make a great movie .
this movie was alright . it just was n't very funny or interesting . i might have laughed once throughout the movie .
a good family entertainment adventure . not quite as good as the original movie , but still an enjoyable evenings entertainment . worth the purchase price .
this blu-ray version of the movie is exactly like the dvd version . just at a lower price . buy for fans . rent for others .
wonderful , funny and touching all at the same time . great job by kevin kline and sally field .
it will stay in my collection as a prequel to the lord f the rings series but wo n't revisit it often .
the story line was not what we expected and was highly entertaining . we found ourselves laughing out loud more than once .
modern classic with a blu-ray loaded down with tons of bonus content . not to mention incredible sound and picture . and at this price ? amazing bargain .
all the actors in this movie are wonderful , but i love mama and the little girls take the show ! ! ! love this one ! ! !
my husband and i watch this show everyday . this dvd series stays in our dvd player . you will fall in love with the characters .
hilarious ! this movie is th usual from will farrell ... it is a family favorite to watch on movie night ... great flick ! !
so much love between a man and his dogs . the story is well described . the dogs should have won an award for their performance . great movie .
the dvds came very quickly . i absolutely love this show and always will . it has all of the episodes for the second half of season two .
was n't sure how good this would be but i thought this movie was pretty good . i liked how it ended too .
i absolutely loved the story . the only thing i think it needs is to have spanish subtitles . great set anyway .
good movie.. the acting was decent and the story was good .. i recommend seeing this
was a wonderful series in the 80 's . i enjoyed the series today as much as i enjoyed it then . everything arrived on time and was packaged well . the dvd 's ran well .

great show , great writing and great stories . love the characters and really enjoying all episodes . so wonderful and refreshing . thanks .
i had no idea what to expect from this movie and i have to say that i was pleasantly surprised . i had tried reading some of the books but i found them quite dry .
sandra bullock is so great in this movie and we love football . we bought this as one of our first blu-rays because it is going to be a classic .
the movie had a lot of twists and turns , however , the overall storyline was pretty predictable . i did not expect the cursing and explicit language and think it would have been a better movie without it .
i am a true romantic and enjoy comedies as well . this is a great movie with two great actors in it . julia roberts and richard gere do an excellent job in this movie
we love this series . great acting and great script . ca n't wait for the next season to start . only reason i have showtime .
this movie was funny and lighthearted . it gave a great message on what family means and what is important . this is a must see film .

this is an enjoyable classic . while not for everyone , if you enjoy the comedy of eddie murphy , this is worth your time .
i love the female lead from her days on seinfeld . one would n't think she could top that role but she has ! you will laugh , laugh , and laugh some more .
helps complete my james bond series , some i enjoy more than others . this bond i do n't particular like but i love the series .

this movie is enjoyable to watch . it is n't very scary , but you can still sit down and enjoy watching it every now and then .
it did n't make me laugh ; it made me sick to my stomach . i ca n't understand how this movie rates all those stars .
its always fun to see another godzilla movie , and this one delivered like the others so it was fun to add to our collection .
i love period dramas and this one is a keeper for sure . it is well acted in every way and i have added it to my dvd collection .
this country has seen a lot of bad things happen to it over the last 4 years . now you know why . obama .
i had heard this was not a very good movie , but i thought it was well done . gerard butler was not the best phantom they could have chosen , but the rest of the cast were fine .
great alien movie with lots of action while trying to get rid of the bad alien as there are two of them and the good guys picked the good alien to help .

excellent movie and great acting . it keep you interested all throughout the movie . harrison ford and michelle are really good in this movie
believe it or not this version is tons better than the one with humphrey bogart , audrey hepburn , and william holden . bogart and holden were too old for their parts .
it has all the elements you should expect from this kind of movie . one of the early fight scenes in the snow clearly inspired kill bill vol . 1. very creative .
it is all about guns and shooting - at people . i thought it was going to be about a basketball player .
awesome , inspiring , funny movie . goldie hawn is great here ! ! ! it 's an old one but one of her best films ! i love it .
first introduction to the iron horse , it is a must have for any sports fan
if you like a romantic comedy , then this one is a sweet story . often predictable , but still worth your time .
if you love agatha christie , you will love this series made from her books . this actress does a great job .

not like the original at all to me was a lot of nothing but music was good and 3d ok
lots of good songs and special effects . steve martin is worth the price of admission or , in this case , purchase .
modern theme action show . watching season 2 now . like the actors and story line . reminds me of some clint eastwood type movies .
this is a great series ! fun and very like the book ! they should have continued it . . . great gift for someone you like .
good acting , good plot and a well made movie . way out there but entertaining in the same was as the indiana jones series .

i love the actors in this and i love the story line . if you want a heartfelt movie , try watching this one .
i have n't watched this movie since the 70 's when i was a kid . the songs and the scenes brought back a lot of memories . it was wonderful viewing this .
awsome movie great actors . and of course this is the greatest story ever told . they do n't make good bible story 's like this anymore .
just a silly movie but then i like movies that make me smile and does n't take life so seriously . it 's fun .
i watched this show on usa and loved every minute of it . anthony michael hall is so good in it .
this movie is so like mark harmon . he is a good guy and all bad things seems to happen to good guys .
done very well ! wish i could find more movies like this . we 've watched it about 18 times and we 're adults ! check this out , because it is so worth it .
funny movie . some scenes are kind of raunchy but it still was a funny movie . though i would n't let young children watch it .
hugh fan of the series . i am so in to it that i watch the entire series in one day .
i think each movie has gotten better . not that that was hard . my teenage daughter loves them . we have to complete the series .
this show is as good now ( or even better ) than i remembered . the characters and the story lines are all wonderful . truly , this is a tv classic .
it was not what i was looking for , i would have to say i would not recommend this film to anyone .
it 's not the best but its an ok movie , some dumb parts but its good for a zombie movie collection .
bad content i did not want to watch this film . it is not a good film to watch at all . i thought it was going a comedy . its not !
visiting area soon . wanted to know more about it . this documentary did the job and presented a lot of information .
it is a great collection of the show and i enjoy watching the waltons . i would recommend it to everyone . it ship fast .
i love halloween , and this movie is a real treat . i watch it with my kids all month long , and it never fails to capture our hearts .
my hubby loves this show and i bought all the series sets for him for christmas . he likes having them on dvds .
i think this remake was very well done and well cast . it was a little disappointing that they changes the location ( no mars ) but otherwise i thought it was well worth the time .
this movie was to slow for me i got very bored even the music was boring i wo n't get another silent movie .
this movie has an edge and it 's cool . i could watch it twenty times and grow more obsessed with each viewing . watch it in a dark room .
this is a movie that is bound to become a classic . having not lived in germany during wwii , i imagine that the times were very much as portrayed .
this movie falls into my top 20 worst movies of all time . i ca n't believe i sat through the entire movie . please , please please consider almost any other movie before you watch this one .
i really enjoyed this series , it is so different from other shows . holds my interest through out the show and makes me look forward to the next one .
i just saw this for the first time . another typical chevy chase vacation movie . it is entertaining and will give you a few laughs .
this one of my daughters favorite movies . she loves to dance and sing along . this has a cute story line
wow ! this is a wonderful series full of drama and intrigue . you 're constantly left thinking and become almost as obsessed as the main character with finding out the truth . ca n't wait for more !
basically the anime version of the terminator with alot of violence , blood , and somewhat nudity . nice late 80s early 90 's cheese .
i loved this cartoon . it is both different from the ordinary cartoon and it is soooo funny . really enjoyed it !
have not gotten around to watching the whole thing yet but started it . i remember watching it when it first came out , wanted my son to get a chance to see it .
ok ... this is the last one for today . great . one word says it all . you should not be required to use and waste words to rate anything .
a wonderful movie and the best on jesus ! next to the gospel of john of course . the tape was in good condition and i loved the movie !
i love this series and will always give it five stars . it has everything , action , aliens and great story plots .
sharon still looks great , but the film is not worth the purchase . enjoy the classic original , but pass on this one !
it was a very good movie and the whole family enjoyed watching the movie , while we watched the movie we were all laughing
it was a great movies that deserve ten rates and there nothing dislike about it i like it very alot .
everytime i watch one of these episodes , i learn something new . i only wish there was something as good on tv now .
high action movie . i liked the movie but it is very bloody with a lot of close up scenes . my wife did not like these scenes .
i loved both these movies and enjoyed that they were both offered together for a great price . great movie pack .
we thought it was hilarious although our son thought it was a little scary . loved both main characters in the movie . tragic loss ... .
i have all these books and even though the movies can live up to my imagination , i still liked them very much .
really didnt see much of it . i cut it off was bored to death . it may have been better at the end i do n't really know .
i love this series ! ! ! the characters , the costumes , the life style ... a time where so many people had just nothing compared to these folks ! ! !
this was a very well acted production . i thought the makeup to age the actors could have been better , but this was a good investment .
the movie is weird . and it 's a bit drawn out . but the story is unusual , and the characters are very well done . it was instantly one of my favorites .
excellent tv series from the early 70 's . columbo is still a joy to watch 4 decades later .
if there going to come out with more one piece collection like this than it better be english dubbed because only having english subtitles is just lame and not very enjoyable in my opinion .
i was n't sure if i was going to get this one but i 'm very glad that i did . thank you !
i got this movie as a christmas gift for my dad . i definitely recommend it to any adventure movie lover . it is both clever and exciting !
not sure of this one need to show it more times only seen it once will be watching more time soon as christmas is on it way
i thought this would be an interesting movie , and it was . i did n't expect shakespeare , and i was correct . al in all , it was an enjoyable movie .
dvd 's were clear and crisp . the program 's were interesting . i 'm really enjoying the series .
i bought this for my husband 's birthday gift and he loves it . now he wants the other seasons . it came on time and in good condition .
i would like to see another season cause it was n't long enough for me so excited about this show yay
dark , spooky , a little humor and great performances make this film a keeper . boris karloff wants to rise from the dead and has his butler try to help him . enough said . 8 )
it was a good movie , a lot better than i thought it would be . my husband and i both enjoyed it .
its an incredible movie that never allowed me to see ahead of the movie even when i knew the ending because of the title
i have purchased this movie 3 times now over many years . great vampire flick . even my children love this movie ,
love clint eastwood , would get any of his movies , great family movie the family could watch . would recommend for family viewing
i highly recommend this movie for children and adults alike . a first class production and we were on edge of our seats the entire film . if you like adventure films you will love this !
this movie was kind of hard to get into . the subject matter was a little strange and it took me awhile to truly understand what was going on .
excellent movie , great plot , and story , must have for any dead space fan and action movies fan . will help you enjoy the dead space story if you 're into it
this one completed our collection so i 'm very happy ... that my daughter 's happy .. plus , it 's a good quality disc .
an age old story line with the usual circumstances , but the acting is very good , which makes it an interesting . i 'd recommend it for anyone , but especially for couples .
if you ever need a movie to make you realize how much you have and appreciate it this is the one . i hope will smith gets an award for his performance .
great movie ! i am glad to have it as part of my collection .
i loved watching this movie again . it was a lot of fun . got ta love the old star trek actors . i recommend this one for watching .
i think it will become more interesting with each season , it needs work . a little basic but hopefully will mature in future seasons .
despicable me is a great movie . my kids love it , and so do i. comedy , action , and drama . everything a good story should have .
good sequel , good second group of actors . plenty of military action with a little science fiction throw in for good measure
i find this show fascinating , and at times depressing . i just got around to watching season 5 , and there have been changes in the lives of the characters . looking forward to finishing it !
all i can say is this is a must see - a hilarious film you can truly watch over and over again . : )
this movie is well done . if you like edward norton , you definetly wo n't be disappointed .
this dvd was hard to find in stores but i 'm glad amazon had it and this dvd is worth buying
i 've only watched two of the movies so far , but both have been excellent quality . if you 're into westerns this is as good as it gets .
i really enjoyed this movie . so much more than i thought it would be . i have added to my own collection . one of my favorite movies . a must see . crazy good movie .
this movie has a plot and good acting . russell crowe play robin hood to the `` t '' . i would recommend this movie and think you will enjoy it .

a great asian action thriller . acting was very good . nice story line . enjoyed the costumes and scenery . i was not disappointed .
i recieved this movie , but it was scratched in a part of the movie so it does skip over a scene . otherwise , it arrived promptly and the company was very friendly !
my sister loves any movie with colin firth in it . i am going to give it to her for mothers day . i was so glad to be able to find it and such a great price .
liked this movie much more than i thought i would . the story is original , the ending unexpected , and holds up to repeated viewing .
the dvd that you sent was bad , that did not make my day very good , so i did not like the dvd . roberts
i really liked this new show and enjoyed watching it again on dvd . it turns out i did n't even realize i missed some episodes . i plan on purchasing season two as well .

we liked it because it was scary and so realistic and the acting was spectacular . the kids loved the series .
i like clint eastwood westerns and this one does have some surprises for the main character to discover along the way .

my son was so interested in seeing this movie after seeing the book at a doctor 's office . he has been thrilled with the quality and the story !
movie is for the grand daughter , she 's just over 2 and it 's her favorite character and it teaches the young one to get along with others

it 's a good movie and i do n't want to write anything to give away any of the details of the movie ! watch it !
the movie was visually awesome and a great story plot that somehow seemed to flow with the beatles music ! you wo n't regret it !
i have used it once . it is very easy to use , and it seemed to make my tv pictures much clearer .
first movie better think jennifer acting getting to her head she is good in this one the plot / location was lacking more woody next movie -- lots more woody less jennifer
i love these two seasons of the office . these old seasons are classic ! i am one happy customer . nice work
one of my favorite movies ! i used to watch this all the time as a child at my grandma 's house . phenomenal acting and great story
an outstanding western set during or at the end of the civil was . very well done . it was a rough time in american history .
this movie has such a great message . funny , sad , moving . highly recommend seeing this movie . i loved it so much i bought it !
this movie is good in concept and idea , however tend to be boring but nevertheless captivating .
we just love watching these too men travel and find odd and different things in the most unexpected places . i will order some more .
i truly love this movie . the times were so simple and people were so good . too bad our world has gotten itself into such a mess with nobody having respect for anything .

true story and a great fun movie to watch with the family ... last time i checked his record still stands ... .great viewing
great movie ! this is the 3rd time i 've watched it and both my wife and myself enjoyed it from start to finish .
my ( grown ) brother is enjoying sharing his childhood experience with his son . this product is a real hit with all the family . thank you .
this the last of the everybody loves raymond series so yea you need to get it to complete the series
nice collection of touching and entertaining movies . a great addition for the movies i love to watch again and again .
i would highly recommend this series of jesse stone stories to any and all . a great performance once again by tom selleck in his role as the small town police chief .
my grandchildren and i love this movie , we have watched it several times on family movie nights . we love disney movies .
a great show that watch more then once a year and still keeps me laughing my head off ! very nice !
i love this movie , the actors and actress 's are some of my favorite . i am glad i purchased this movie .
i 'm not much of a sport guy but this was an interesting and true story . it 's also nice to see that there are people out in the world that still care about others .
how can anyone not like these three ladies in their prime ? the story is top notch - something we could watch once in a while for the rest of our lives .
thought this was just plain fun . it was light , true and pretty realistic . nice to watch a movie that was light , not depressing , with no violence , sex or darkness .
the coen brothers make some of the best movies , and this is one of their best . a definite buy .
i watch this movie very often , like once a month . great family movie , great story , and morals in the movie . watch with your family .
i had the pleasure of reading the book first ... the movie was good , but i still think the book was better .
usually , when i watch this kind of movie it 's because i 'm lazy and do n't want to have to think . it helped me pass the time , but it was highly predictable .
this movie was bought as a gift for someone else who i had told about the movie . as far as the quality of the movie it was in great shape .
i love these episodes . spongebob is a great cartoon character that i can watch over and over all day long .
this is a really bad remake of the original . while the first one is a classic with a great story line and good acting , this one is cheesy .
not one of the better animated computer generated movies . however i received the blu-ray disc very quickly .
this was a cute movie and it had issues as a childhood brothers would have . one grew up and the other still not .
i am a huge matthew mcconaughey fan but lets fact a fact , this movie was disappointing . he is so much better than this !
this is a great movie ! i am glad to have it as part of my collection .
i loved it but i can not save it . and it was not very clear . i do n't know if it is my computer or not ?
i enjoyed the movie but it was a little slow . it was a bunch of good actors in a movie . seemed a little thrown together .
sweet but boring little story . good actors but they did n't have much to work with on this script . too bad because it could have been a nice family film
the 60s brought great movies , suitable for all ages . and they did n't come out every other day , either . tony curtis - hero , good guy , and ladies man .
omg ! he now loves lighting mcqueen . even had to get him a race car bed . fun movie , even as an adult i enjoyed watching .
there is nothing like a classic black & white movie with stars and a story ! ! do n't miss it -- a real feel-good movie !
really enjoyed this movie , to me it was better than the first movie . if you saw the first one you need to see this one also .
you can never go wrong with audie murphy . what a fantastic actor . we are busy trying to complete our audie murphy collection and are glad we found this film . excellent .
i actually bought this season for my grandson . he loved one particular episode and would n't be happy until he could watch it with his friends . spongebob is great for kids .
the disc came with no scratches . also it looks like the picture . kinda surprised that a movie with no plot would be entertaining .
i have seen this story several times and enjoyed this one as well as the others . good job on aging the actors .
i saw this with my dad and i wanted to share with my son . i recommend amazon for most all my movie purchases . i get them usually within a week , that is awesome !
love the garfield holiday specials ! ! they are fun and unique to each holiday ! ! love the songs ! ! garfield and the gang are sure to bring a smile to your holiday : - )
a wonderful blend of actors and animation . the story of heroes is always enjoyable , especially those of heroes overlooked in their time .
i liked this . i laughed out loud many times . it 's more of a silly slower moving , witty humor . if you like that this movie is fun
this movie was kind of disappointing for me i really expected alot , and maybe that was my problem . despite all this matthew perry and bruce willis provide enough laughs to make it worth renting .
really enjoyed this dvd . it is action packed and full of great acting . this is a classic movie . i would recommend the purchase of this movie .
my wife loves this series and has gotten me into it also . we are buying the rest of the series as it becomes available .
definitely recommend this upbeat spy drama , love that has enough humor to make it fun too watch , not too dark
i really enjoyed the story line and the laughs that went along with this movie . great for the kids as well ! good , clean fun !
nice movie , will watch it again , enjoyed watching it , funny witty lines and interesting plot , all i all a great sunday afternoon movie
i could sit here and watch this show all day long ! i was happy to be able to find the whole collection of episodes in one place
classic henry fonda movie set back in the depression and what families went through , must see for entire family .
if you like action movies , this one is for you . effects are out of this world . cast performance and story are very good .
my wife and i love this show ! ! the later seasons have a lot more death and poor language which we could do without . well written , always funny , and incredibly entertaining .
this is a movie that my family loved . kids will enjoy watching this again and again . very entertaining and funny . loved it .
this movie did measure up to the original movie . i liked the original much better . but it was worth watching once .
excellent movie and acting . you get in the movie and this a movie you dont want to end . worth buying and watching over and over
there is no sign of madea here . a very good movie . well done . great storyline , well written . i loved everything about this movie .
i love this movie . highly recommend this movie to everyone . one of the greatest movies ever .
i seem to forget about this movie during the holidays but this year i did n't . fun movie that people of all ages can enjoy .
the hero is portrayed by one of our favorite actors . we watched all of the available season and wish there were more
one of the worst movies that i have ever seen . the film quality was very poor , and it did not make since .
it 's not the original but i still liked it and i will watch it again . would rather have digital download then ultraviolet though
an interesting movie about life on board a submarine during wwii . all in all it 's a fairly typical submarine movie with a typical plot . acting was well done and scenes were realistic .
i own almost all of his movies and i was a little upset that this was not a movie but it was good ... i 'll keep it , it was interesting .
bought it for the kids i enjoyed it too great 3d would add it to your 3d collection good pop in and out
not the best acting ... somewhat predictable . i wanted to see this dvd after another review but , hey , it just was n't what i thought it would be .
thought these were so cute and funny . bought when amazon running two for one . they do n't seem to have those anymore .
it was cute and fun to watch . the quality was very good and the animation was good . everyone will like it .
i purchased this mainly for the movie the night they saved christmas , but we also enjoyed the other holiday movies in the collection .
any time a movie becomes a franchise it will wear out its welcome , but the first hangover was definitely a great comedy .
i got the box set and i love it . i like the artwork and dvd is the best . but i love all of the csi shows .
jamie fox was so good playing ray . the entire story and the music were very good for the entire family .
i enjoyed the movie very much . if you liked the harry potter series at all , you 'll like this movie . filled with action and lots of magical fighting , how can you go wrong ?
i really enjoyed this series . the actors were so real doing their parts . story line was great . looking forward to next season .
three great actors loved everything about this movie one we will enjoy time and time again bob australia
this series is so engaging , well written and well acted that it should have gone on for years longer . how about a reunion show ?
cute movie watched it on tv now i ordered it love the cast . mom and dad watch first to see if it is good for your kids
season three is great , action packed . i just ca n't watch one episode . i end up watching 3 or 4 at a time . i ca n't wait to see what happens next .
a classic film that stands the test of time . these actors knew how to tell a story and hold one 's attention .
i love all movies with sam elliott . i also love the solid content of the older western movies . it was an easy movie to watch .
this show surprised me , not having any interest in politics , i find the storyline keeps my interest . i think the casting for this program was excellent .
this was an ok movie , not a keeper in my way of thinking , but a nice , pleasant movie . if you like a pleasant movie to watch , this is it .
one of the better made for tv movies ... sad , but happy at the same time . i think i liked the story-line better than the actual movie itself .
my family loves this film , fun and well paced . steve martin is great , as usual , and the story line has kept my kids interested from a very young age .
i 'm not quite as captivated as i was with seasons 1 and 2 , but it 's beautifully portrayed as a costume drama . i like it .
this is one i had n't seen in years and wanted to buy for my children to watch . it is n't as terrible as today 's movies .
first episode of first season was ok but i know they got funnier as the show went along . it was neat to be able to watch it free on the kindle fire .
great movie and reminder that we complain way to much and not thankful for what we do have . need to thankful for what you do have first .
i do n't know about you but killing a bunch of people makes this movie more realistic do n't know why people said it was bad i think it was one of the best transformers movies yet ...
this would have been a good family movie if it was n't for the one curse word in it . not sure why they could n't have left it out .
while this movie is filled with awesome visual effects that will leave most happy , it seemed to lose something that made the original movies so memorable . still , true star wars fans will be pleased .
i love watching movies that are based on true stories . i know they have to add some extra drama that did n't really happen , but it adds excitement . this was a great movie for race fans !
the best real life drama i have seen in years it is one of my favorite movies it took some time to find it on dvd have worn out the vhs tape i had of this movie .
one of kurt russell 's favorite movies , mine to , really gritty and dark , for today 's standards they could do more , but back in the day it was ground breaking .
this is a classic of a movie and will be one to remember in the future of a family with the catholic church and what is right and wrong .
it works great and i 'm glad they got back on track with the story . you will not be let down .
while the ship model was trash the rest of the movie was good . what do you expect for a man directing this with hardly any budget
absolutely great family movie . what a gem . they do n't make these kinds of movies enough anymore . watched it twice with the kids
many many subtle plots . a great movie for teenagers to watch and learn about honesty and integrity . good beats evil .
he plays both a scary heavy , then went to a great comedian . he 's great on snl . i recieved it fast and in great shape .
totally awesome show ! i highly recommend it to any and everyone who enjoys science fiction with a story line included .
good action movie . lots of good actors . not the best movie i have ever watched but definitely entertaining . worth watching once .
i have always been used to tyler perry making plays and stuff . he really played his part wonderfully . this movie was full of action and had a great story behind it .
this is a great movie , we enjoyed as much as original movie . highly recommended for any age group to watch
this season is where it starts to get good because brenda left . she was terrible ...
this sequel is even better than the first one . very intense and the directors style is most unique . watch it over and over .
magic mike ( channing tatum ) was a hit , all the way ! hope to see much more of this sexy man ! so , yeah , great movie , good buy !
i only watched a few minutes of this video . when someone was killed that soon in the movie , i just did n't want to watch the rest .
the dvd arrived promptly and in good condition ; it 's a great movie for us old guys with some of our favorite folks playing their best parts .
this is a really great family movie , it has got a great message in it . five stars all the way ! ! ! !
it 's funny , but i ca n't watch it , because my dog watches tv too , and jumps at the tv trying to attack the animals on the show .
these appear to have been remastered , i own the dvd 's of this and this is such and improvement in video quality ! ! !
saw this movie at the theater , and it was really good , so i had to buy it when it came out on dvd .
i love the movie , so for me is great to have in my library . got it at a great price in exact condition as described .
overall it was a decent enough movie . it really needed to be about 10 minutes longer and wrap a few things up . the original was better .
so awesome ! ! ! worth every penny and i keep watching it over and over again ! ! i hope there will be many more movies like this ! ! !
i enjoyed the dog who saved christmas it is a good family movie anytime of the year i recommend it to everyone
one of our grandsons favorite movies . love to watch him view it and see how excited he gets . recommend to others . .
this movie was not what i was expecting and i do not recommend it to anyone unless you like this kind of humor .
this movie was a gift for my daughter . she now has the complete set for the mummy series . we all enjoy watching these movies .
this is an awesome series . my husband loved it . a bit much for foul language but humorous all the same . lol : )
this is a fun take on an old story . you will enjoy the tale and the excitement throughout . this is a great twist on an old tale .
the blu ray version is just stunning and worth watching . makes watching things at home in high def great and enjoyable .
this is a fun movie and it 's great for being mindless . the first one is way better but this was a fun follow up .
i loved this movie since the first time i watched it and it was a great price for my money . : o )
he thinks this is a classic movie and watches regularly . for him it is pure entertainment and the actors are great .
i watched only the first episode and that was enough . the main story lines were vampires are cool and i ca n't wait to have sex with one .
read the book , wanted to see the book . this book written so many years ago is true to todays world .
this has to be one of keanu reeves 's best movies since the matrix . this movie is a really good drama . this is a must see film .
this movie is a great movie a christmas classic to me me and my family have always enjoyed watching it and glad to have it on dvd i still have on vhs
this is well written and the acting is superb ! i highly recommend this series . it 's interesting to live through the war with these characters . all the story lines pull you in from the very beginning .
she loves this movie and i 've lost track how many times she 's watched it and sings to it every single time .
this must be the funniest dvd on the planet , but is this complete ? i read somewhere that it should be over 90 minutes , is this correct ?
you can believe that this man really lived and had some of the adventures this movie portrays . the photography is great .
we have loved this movie since it came out , so we were very happy to find a dvd in very good shape at a reasonable price . we will be shopping here more often .
the story is good , the action was great , you must buy this movie , it will not let you down love to have his power .
not as good as expected but still entertaining . tommy lee jones excellent . sensitive subjects but handled very nicely . enjoy it .
diane keaton is great as always and the movie has some great twists in it , funny , sweet & a tad sad .
i am the biggest batman fan ever , seeing him show emotions is a rare sight and that episode did just that .
what more can i say . this is simply a great christmas movie for the whole family .
nice to see the big stars putting together a show for the kids , well done for the kids and adults will find some humor along the way .
be sure to have the time to sit down , a little long but well worth the time spent to watch .
i 've been wanting this series on dvd , and finally got them at a price i could afford . the shipping and quality were excellent ! !
the movie was very good and the actors and plot was good . they could put in a better ending . i would highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes action .
do n't waste your time on this one , terrible story line lousy acting kind of looks like it was done by a group of teenagers putting together a movie ... ...
it was a great movie . i loved it . i saw it years ago and decided i wanted it in my home movie collection . i would recommend it to all .
i loved this series its the only one i did like . we just started watching it tonight . its funny and relaxing . a great show
loved this show when it was on the air in the 80s and love to watch this series over and over . very funny and a different version of bruce that you will enjoy
this movie was different than i thought and in a good way had me wondering what was going on until the very end . it was very good and recommend it for a family to watch .
i thought it was a really good movie . there were good actors , lots of action , and the story actually made sense even if it was a little bit unrealistic .
i have all of the star wars dvd 's now and i 'm very happy , thank you so much . do n't ask me again
these old classic disney movies are the greatest . my family really enjoyed this movie and my husband & i got to relive our time of watching it when we were kids . great movie !
i never did buy this when it first came out so i bought it to add to my collection . i like the actors in it and i like the storyline . the shipping was also very fast .
i could watch this movie over and over ! i cried for almost the entire last hour of this movie . . . will be watching this again and again !
i love this show . i wish it will run longer though . good cast and good twist . i love watching it through amazon prime , free of commercials .
this is the best version of king kong i have seen . the upgrade in advanced photography is excellent .
this was not tim burton 's or johnny depp 's best . i found it way too campy and hard to watch . sorry .
this was a must have for our dvd collection . great movies that brought back lots of memories from me younger years .
you have to watch this through once and do n't let anyone tell you about it first .
i like anything bruce willis is in , lots of action , do not like the r rated parts , takes away from the movie art of it . makes any movie lower class .
good family movie ! as a fan of the old japanese scifi movies ( godzilla , etc . ) this was a fun movie to watch .
my family likes this movie . i gave it 4 out of 5 only because there are some movies that are funnier to our family . it 's a cute movie that has its funny moments .
for those of you who have read the book save your money . you will be greatly disappointed , most of the good parts were left out . i wish i could get my money back
i ca n't wait to watch this classic movie with our daughter . it is a nice addition to our movie library .
this is the movie that brought back the die hard series as relevant action series . one for the collection of dvds
with these three stars how can a movie miss . we loved it . the writing could have been better , but the great acting made up for it .
i am sure the movie is good , however i have yet to see the entire movie . purchase the movie today .
was an ok movie . i really would n't go to the movies to see it though .
i saw many of my favorite stars in a comical light this movie was funny and i will enjoy watching it again and again .
i bought this movie because i like patrick stewart . the movie was just awful . i would bet that stewart is not proud of this one .
i also reviewed season 1. enjoyed this season as much as the first . well written plots , interesting twists , more character development . ca n't wait to start season 3
very interesting movie with good stars . had a lot of twists and turns and did n't turn out the way that you thought it should .
touching story of a disjointed father and his daughter , played beautifully by both fonda 's . kate hepburn , too , was excellent , as always .
it came on time . it is a good watch and i dont have any complaints about it . it is in excellent condition . i am very pleased .
i ordered this for myself and a family member and we all loved the movie ( it was very well made ) but the message was outstanding !
i had a difficult time getting into it and i gave it as long as i could before i just could not take it any more and turned it off about 10 minutes in .
very fast shipping and item was in great condition and just as described by the seller .
this is a good movie ! ! i love liam neeson and he did n't let me down in this movie . a great watch ! !
this film was a let down , the story line was not there . i would not recommend this film to anyone .
borrowed back and enjoyed it myself . lots of noise and action so the kids liked it and watched it twice
it is a series like no other , it takes time to get used to but once you do it is a very good series , i have all 4 seasons now . : o )
this is one of the 90 's best ! this collection is awesome , and having all seven seasons to watch anytime is just great . i highly recommend this to any boy meets world fan !
the movie trailer was the best part of the movie . the movie was slow , boring and a waste of time to watch . the ending was the only good part .
what a great romance . i watched it when i was younger and i think i enjoy it even more now . it was such a moving story that your heart just goes out to the characters .
love watching this movie and now i have it for my own . drew barrymore and the rest of the cast are wonderful . the story is great . i love .
this was a good deal for the price ... i love all these movies and there were no scratches or skipping , yay !
my husband and i watched this movie and really enjoyed it . it was a wonderful story line and so well acted .
really enjoyed the movie lots of action and comedy can be enjoyed by all the family i would recommend this
there is so much going on in todays politics that we do not know . this book brings out some of the mystery about this man . i hope that more people read it and believe what is said .
it was okay but with all the hype put out about this movie it was a bit of a let down when i actually saw it . i would have hoped for a lot more .
suspenseful , but not well done . no build up to a thrilling end . i do not recommend this movie at all .
this was well written and well played with twists , turns and then an unforgettable center that was not what i had anticipated .
this is probably the best series ever . the acting is excellent , the scenery realistic , and the action breathtaking .
i love mel 's humor . this set captures many of his best . the special gold box price i paid made me purchase this set after considering it a while .
great characters and appropriate family story lines , love the humor and morals ... enjoy watching what i grew up watching with my daughter .
i used to love this show . the episodes are still funny to me and it has been a great blast from the past to watch .
my husband and i watched this movie together and enjoyed it tremendously . you will not be disappointed ... watch it with your family ... they will love it too .
really if you have to read this you never watched this movie . it 's a classic . and it 's dirty dancing . : d
this movie was movie was moving about a real thing that happened loved it would like to see more like it
this series brings back memories of my childhood when we used to watch wholesome programs . this one is so cute and once again i am able to enjoy it .
enjoyed watching it . everyone is so young . a keeper . well done . i hate this having to have so many words .
great bargain and shipping was fast . the grand kids love the movies and so do i. the colors in this movie are so lively and colorful .
this anime is fun but you need to watch the first season before you watch it . i hope you enjoy it . : )
the price of the dvd was good and the delivery time was excellent . the dvd is in really good condition and i 'm happy with my purchase . would certainly use this seller again .
you should get this movie . one of the greatest movies of the series .
i rate this the second greatest series after lost . so much happens it keeps you on the edge of your seat at all times . never a dull moment .
just what the doctor ordered . packaging , quality all as expected . if i get into buying dvd collections again and jump at the chance , but i am all digital now .
this is a good comedy . it is for an adult audience due to sexual situations . it is nothing like the original dark shadows .
interesting pairing of a young mark harmon with film legend , elizabeth taylor . while the story line was unusual , the acting was superb !
this is a movie which i missed when it first came out , and always wanted to see it . i love the story and the acting , even if it is clearly no longer a contemporary movie .
i love werewolves and vampires . this was a little different than the usual and i enjoyed it .
great movie ! it was awesome to see a part of history that i knew little about . very well directed and acted ! it will keep you on the edge of your seat ! i highly recommend it !
an absolute classic ! what more can i say ! you have to look to the past to find some of the best movies ever made .
the absolute best planet of the apes collection , it is that much better in blu ray . if you like the planet of the apes then this collection is a must have .
it 's a funny movie with great animation . the minions are awesome and kind of steal the show . adults seem to like it as much as kids .
this is something i have been looking for for over a year . husband extremely happy to get this long wished for movie .
i have been trying to find this in the stores for a while , but no luck . got this for my mom and she loved it .
never received movie from the seller . but , i have seen the movie before and it is a great movie . worth the price and worth the watch . hope to own it myself soon .
this looked like it would be an enjoyable movie . it was on last week on tcm but i missed most of it . what i did see , i enjoyed .
dissapointed ... i return it but no answer yet ... .the problem was that another movie played instead of the one i order ... .but the case was title correct ... and no phone to call and complaint
we really enjoyed it . very entertaining for all of our family , mostly adults now . it has action , interesting story line , some humor , and clean language .
this show has been the greatest on tv . watched it when it was on tv years ago . glad to see it on dvd . watching the whole episode all over again after so many years .
just love the story behind this movie . glad that i have it as part of my collection that i have with my other favorite movies .
bones is an all around great show ! the character dynamics have changed for this season , and it is just as lovely as always !
some episodes are better than others , but each one leaves you wanting more . well developed characters and multiple , but equally interesting , story lines . a very entertaining and thought provoking .
i really did n't know what to expect from this film , but i really enjoyed it , another winner from ken russell
with the high customer rating and a good trailer , i had high expectations for this movie but i was greatly disappointed . the movie is quite slow . at best it is an average movie ,
i loved the action , not too much , and the characters were entertaining . i would watch the movie again in the future .
i feel pretty much the same as i felt about the first season . good show for those who like mystery & murder mystery .
purchased all of these for my granddaughter 's birthday . she loved them . the dvd 's arrived in great shape with fast service .
i 'd watch this again soon . great action , thrills , and a good story to boot . i 'd keep an eye on the new guy .
after waiting for so long at last we have a masterpiece with good sound and a very good picture . a dvd you must own .
fantastic , that 's all i can say . 5 star tv . swedish version of the usa & # 34 ; the killing & # 34 ; . gritty crime drama , you wo n't see anywhere else .
i was sorry to hear of his passing . there are very few shows like this any more , interesting , make u think some , and have a little humor .
lots of actions not too bad for a bunch of old guys , do n't know what happened to steven segal , he 's not in it .
i love music and dance . it does n't matter what type as long as it is good dancing . one day i 'll be the star .
i bought this for my grandchildren at their request , and it held their attention , which is really hard to do these days . cute story .
what can i say , amazon always comes threw when it comes to the prices . the product was in its original packaging and in great condition when arrived . not to mention this is a great film .
one of their best episodes . it is an episode that even people who never saw the series find very funny . a thanksgiving day tradition !
this is a great movie . i love denzel washington and this movie has a lot of action scenes . i would recommend it to anyone .
awesome story line good acting with the 2 main characters , very funny have to see it with friends and such
excellent all around . good story with good morals and values . good color and picture quality . i loved it and would recommend it for all audiences .
not what i had expected but in a good way , really funny . i would buy this on dvd for sure .
unbelievable but a true story . my wife and i have watched it many time . it is a sad story but hard to believable that it could be true .
i would recommend this series to anyone who loves a good mystery ... ... have watched them several times ... ... ... good actors and good plots ... ...
i would recommend this movies to all my friend . this movie has suspense , drama and some comedy . an outstanding movie classic .
love any movie that diane keaton is , and it was fun seeing her so young . the movie was a little wacky at times , but still entertaining .
much better than i expected . stallone and arnold are still a great team . great for a movie night when you ca n't decide on something , this will do nicely .
the alfred hitchcock collection is great it has 5 of his best movies in it all the movies in this collection are all classics . and they are all in bluray .
one of the greatest movies of all time ... buy it ! it just might save your life !
would have been better if step by step how to dance in bonus features , still good movie , good story line , great songs .
this was a very creepy , well-done movie . the characters were very convincing and the concept was quite clever . thoroughly entertaining .
in my top three ( 3 ) shows ever on television . every show is new with a great storyline . i love this show !
it has keanu reeves in it ... so gave it a shot : ) it 's entertaining all the way : ) on time delivery and well packaged !

one of my favorite tv shows . happy they are coming out on dvd ! glad to add it to my dvd collection !
what can i say other than this is an anime classic . i loved this anime and am excited that a movie 's on the way . the ending made me cry .
my girlfriend suggested we watch this . i think she enjoyed it or at least understood it . as for me ? i 'm still lost ...
i purchased this since i love south park . normal south park not a big deal but still funny to watch .
did not watch it because we were not expecting a cartoon but a movie with real people . not in the mood for a cartoon .
pretty good . has some really funny moments but i did n't enjoy it as much as his previous films .
the quality of the dvd and the movie itself are both great . it 's one of the best in my hammer horror collection .
love all 3 stars in this movie , damon does a great job in the movie , had been searching for a while for this , at a reasonable price
this is probably my favorite season in the franchise . paris and nicole are amazingly hilarious and the jobs they are forced to do are even more so !
i have loved this since i was a kid and now my kids love it ! enjoyable , suspenseful , and full of action . it 's a must have !
great series plus it was sold at a fair price . it will give me the opportunity to watch those programs which i missed during its time on tv .

it 's not to often that i walk out of a movie , even renting one like this , i hate to do it , but it was so bad i shut it off .
this was one of jerry lewis ' slower shows i thought that i 'd like any of his shows but found this one to be slow enough that i stopped watching after about a half hour .
i loved this movie i have watched several time and am currently letting my brother and his wife watch it .

beautiful presentation with all the choices , including digital . arrived on time for christmas and was the perfect gift for my daughter !
good scifi movie , liked the story line and action scenes , would tell other folks to see it.it is something worth renting on a weekend night .
the second half of the last harry potter lived up to all of our expectations . we had not seen it in the theater and greatly anticipated watching it on the big screen at home .
the story is just great , keeps you drawn in and excited to see what comes next . ca n't wait for the second season .
i got the dvd really fast and it was like new . i will look forward to ordering more movies from you
i have this set of disks that do n't work why do i have to have bad disks do you stand behind this
the wwe is very fun , but making the time to follow it can be challenging . this looks like ( have n't watched it yet ) a good compilation of wwe video .
i saw , this movie 2 times one , in theatres the other on video , good movie and sad ... read , the book you 'll like , it even if your not a stephen king fan .
it was a good price for what i got and also it came in on time and it was not a bad movie .
memories of child hood just did n't do me justice . still a good series to watch
really long , but really worth it . if you have n't seen the extended versions of these movies , you missed a lot .
was a young child during this time so it was interesting and informative insight on how we dealt with the cold war times .
this movie is so good and so necessary ! we do n't all have to be the same to be very special !
this was bought as a gift for my kid who loved it . they do n't make shows like this anymore ! great packaging and quality . a very happy purchase .
this movie was n't bad for a remake . they do get a little out of hand with the language . all in all good
hitchcock , cary grant , fantastic color , beautiful scenery ( including grace kelly ) ; they really do n't make 'em like this anymore .
i recommend this dvd for anyone who likes good , clean movies . we enjoyed watching it and will keep it among those we watch every so often .
i saw this movie on tv a very long time ago and been wanting to see it again . still great !
even though i saw this movie several times , many years ago , it is a very entertaining one and good for all seasons . the acting is terrific !
i love anything that has to do with ghosts so love this series . it 's always fun to watch the show .
great value for the price , like both of these movies and this was perfect . i am very happy with the purchase
this was a very entertaining movie . clint eastwood was awesome . he kept you wondering what he was going to do next . it was both funny and suspenseful .
my grandson had not seen the show and thoroughly enjoyed the story and cast . it was great to see it again .
nothing new under the sun ! ! ! i really was expecting more from the series ... the franchise fell to plan for a great finally ...
let 's just say this film is full of surprises . i was impressed with the quality of the film and the overall cast as well . i would definitely recommend this movie !
this movie was ok it was not to bad for a low budget film i would watch it a few more times then maybe a few more times .
this was a great purchase . i received this product in a timely fashion and the dvd was in excellent condition . i would recommend this seller for future purchases .
this was an ok movie . it was a story i thought i seen before , but the acting at times was horrible , but has a good message behind it .
another good paul newman movie . i like all his films and this one is another good one to have to add to our collection .
i enjoy these types of movies with history , laughter , mystery and a little love story . this movie was a good one keeps you on your toes .
even though the movie is often far away from the original book , it is interesting period work and truly entertaining .
just shows why i do n't and wo n't ever live in california . who needs this ?
i really enjoy this movie , had to get it . it was a great price , it arrived on time , & was in excellent condition . i 'm so happy , very pleased .
what a movie.. tom hanks did an amazing job . wow ... . all the acting actually was excellent and everyone should be proud .
i love doris day , and this movie is wonderful . have seen it before , but could n't resist the dvd . full of suspense , and as always , doris day gives a great performance .
i watched this movie all these years later and could not believe how gorgeous this film is . i love it .

this was a gift for my husband who is a huge neil young fan and he was very happy to receive this as a christmas gift !
a very good movie and story . was a little slow at first no special effects just a very good story .
this is a very good movie . a simple story that comes alive because of a great cast . two thumbs up !
i 'm really glad i stumbled upon this dvd . it 's hard to find a dvd with more than one old school cartoon . they need to have more of these .
i highly recommend this video . it is well done . you have to see it and judge for yourself . sad ending .
you have to see to believe this collection by william castle , its awesome . he has his own style . i really was impressed with his stories , direction and characters . great fun .
great movie with an unexpected ending . although there are some parts of the plot which seems to be missing to complete the whole idea of it .
it was still quite entertaining . jeff bridges and ryan reynolds make a good team and work well together as far as their roles in this film . interesting that they even made this movie but it was entertaining .
this is the best movie ! ! ! i love it so much ! ! everyone should watch it ! the acting is great , the lines are great , the movie is great !
tyler perry did it again ! this is a wonderful movie , his movies have meaning and always get you at the end ! thanks mr. perry for another good one !
funny movie , a bit odd but very funny . something of a classic ... if you have that odd sense of humor this is movie for you .
as usual , all of the older walt disney films are special and this is no exception . i bought it for my 2 young grandchildren , but sit and watch it with them .
this is an awesome sequel to the first . the kids love it just as much and gives me a break from watching the first one over and over .
i have watched this movie over and over especially when i needed inspiration or thought i needed a better perspective on things .
acting is wonderful , and the sets and costumes are awesome . just a delight of a movie .
this was a christmas gift for my girlfriend and she loved it watches it all the time with her husband
this man is always funny and is a good comedy . very good comedy and he always keeps you laughing . watch it .
i bought this movie for one of my sisters and she loves it , she watches it with her grandchildren and says it is a good family movie
the movie was alright , but i think it was more on the level of a teenagers movie rather than an adult movie .
i loved this movie and the theme and the actors . wonderful entertainment . watched it very closely right to the end .
it 's comic book pictures with very little animation . wish i never purchased it ! i do not recommend this to anyone !
i just love watching touched by an angel series ! i wish they would release the other five seasons ! !
i gave this as a birthday gift for a die hard fan of the series . he is very satisfied with the image quality and the special features . highly recommended .
you have to get season 2 but not sure if you have to have season 3. the new spartacus tries to be like the original actor but barely .
what a great series this is ! i love it ! it arrived on time and in perfect condition ! i am addicted to this show !
this movie has no real plot , no action , and terrible acting . i kept waiting for something , anything to happen , but it never did . i want my time back .
really enjoyed this one ... an old one with great values that really stands the test of time . sad the actors are n't with us any longer .
once you see it you are hooked . this is so funny and original . plus the singing is great and catchy .
i 've loved the show from day 1. season 6 disappointed me a bit , but season 7 helped get it back on track !
just could not get into the movie . guess some folks will like it , me ? i did not think that much about it .
my husband & i loved this series ! it 's easy to get all wrapped up in the characters .
loved the movie . i always enjoy watching it . i can never get tired of watching the movie .
this movie is very funny but also very touching . would recommend this movie to everyone who loves a good movie .
what 's not to love about downton abbey ? the costumes are stunning and historically accurate . the actors are masterful . and the writing is compelling and heartbreaking .
some people understand this movie and some people do n't . either you like it do or do n't , i like this movie and that is just my opinion .
strange story line , but totally predictable ... when i 'm in the mood for a good chick flick i love predictable ! love the interactions between characters . very true to life .
i grew up watching this show and enjoy it very much . i like clint walker as an actor and think he could have been the character in real life from his performance .
this entire series is super great for the entire family to watch together . we get many laughs with this one .
just not my sense of humor ! felt it was n't very funny at all , and thought the story line sort of dragged .
the language was n't as bad as i expected it to be . not for young people to watch . my husband and his guy friends thought this was the funniest movie they had seen in years .
i do n't know how i missed this really great old film ! i 'm glad it is back out and i can have it in my collection !
i wish i had starting watching the day it came out . no commercials is a bonus . do n't wait . start watching .
seriously . do you have to say anything else ? that 's really what sold me on the series in the first place .
our 6 yr old grandson is a huge fan of spongebob - so we purchased a couple videos for when he comes to visit . he loves it - we kinda ' do too !

i have this on vhs but wanted to get it on dvd too . glad i did ! ! played nicely ! ! love the cast of characters ! ! all stars ! !
a good , though not very deep thriller . worth a watch , but do n't buy it .
great action . i love the pure good and evil of the story . a repeat watch will be necessary because i might have missed something .
at some point , you would have thought someone would have realized that none of this was going to come together ...
this movies is too funny , sandra bullock , betty white , ryan reynolds mad a good team is this movie , when sandra dance its too funny .
one of the great lawyer flicks out there it 's too bad they do n't have this on blue ray or dvd i would definitely own a copy .

24 is one of the best tv shows ever made . it sucks you in from the beginning and does n't let go . i ca n't wait for this summer to see season 9 .
this is starting be become my favorite trilogy . the chemistry that they bring , and the moments of truth , makes the two seem so real . truly a pleasure to watch

james franco is a great movie actor and his various roles in movie life is always very good to watch .

this is the best transformers series out of all , we watch it all the time and what a great value for 7 dvd 's in one set !
very entertaining , always something going on and every one was fighting about this situation , just because they wanted to start a new life does n't mean they are god , i did enjoy the movie
i love this tv show i use to watch it when i was little and i am happy it came out on dvd
bought a copy for myself and one for a gift . nice to have it around to enjoy when we want to watch a movie with good eye candy , but no plot !
after viewing season 1 , could n't wait to see this one . the dress and history are great to relive that period .
i liked it very much . i have been trying to find concert footage of this band for quit a while . it was not a disappointment .

can not rate the movie , i didnt watch it and i bought it as a gift for someone that i worked with
this was a great movie about a great man . well acted , it might have been a bit long but still worth watching .
it was an okay movie . however i gave it three stars due to the ending of the story . plus it was too long before they got to the real action . also too gory .
i expected the movie to be in color rather than black and white when i reviewed the movie before purchasing it stated that it was in color so that is why i purchased it .
the music man is a wonderful movie , good story , good music , good acting . it is a movie that can be seen more than once and greatly enjoyed very time .
a movie with a story , crisp and witty . i enjoyed the characters and would see it again . two thumbs up
watched five minutes and turned it off . i 'm not found of foul language throughout a movie . total waste of my money . .
just not for everyone subject matter not what i expected . was hoping for a funny movie . would be for adults only since it deal with sex
this was a very interesting , thought provoking movie ! good cast , good story . i wish hollywood would make more like it !
ok movie . nothing really special but has some good moments and not bad .
i love all of the harry potter books and have not seen all of the movies but this one was very good and close to the book

back to the future is a great series . very funny ! great ad to any dvd collection .
this is an outstanding flick ! to my mind , a chick flick 's version of office space ! enjoy !
this is a scary but great movie & # 62 ; it is awesome . then you think there really are people in the world that are like this , then it 's scary .
i appreciate the first three and do n't care much for the fourth but they all beat predator sequels and those awful alien vs predator movies !
this is a very entertaining movie . i enjoyed every minute of it . a must see movie . thank you so much .
this is a hysterical movie . it is even better on dvd . everyone should see this movie . it makes you realize just what can happen when you have too much time on your hands ! lol !
it 's a cute family film . it teaches that sometimes it 's good to be different , even if people are n't that nice about it . very entertaining .
my 4 year old grandson absolutely loves this movie . when it arrived , i opened it and he immediately wanted to watch it . great movie .
bought this for my son and he is trying to get all seasons . came in a timely fashion and at a good price .
great movie . i really enjoy having it in hd dvd . superb quality . to bad hd dvd is not made no more .
you never see this movie on tv anymore . it 's a classic chevy chase movie and a good one at that !
i loved this movie when i saw it the first time and i can watch it over and over . i found it to be very touching at times . give this movie a chance , watch it .
great overall movie christina can sing great and her moves are great . everything work together great . cher is at her best like always
i 've always like this first animated tarzan movie . the kids like it too . disney knows how to entertain kids of all ages .
i love the anime . i am 19 and study anime and film , but when i watch fairy tail i always feel like a little child again : )
this added to her set and now she is very happy , thanks . look forward to using this site in the future to order more stuff .
seasons 3 thru 7 of this were fantastic and amazon prime allows me to relive these episodes anytime i want .
i actually watch the first one love it and yeah so i was wondering how many movie were there so i check out on amazon to get it because it not at the store because the movie is old !
looking forward to watch this movie all over again . it is so funny how little they were before series time ... i love old fashioned lifestyle ! thanks .
my kids love every shrek movie . this is no exception . they were able to keep it funny and entertaining , just like the first one . we actually like this one better than the 3rd .
great movie , kept me laughing ! ca n't wait to see the new movie with mccarthy and bullock . very different from comedies nowadays . reminded me of old school comedy .
excellent family series . i bought them all ! love the bbc family stories . i love the acting in this movie . excellent cast .
gave as a christmas gift to my son . good value ca n't really speak to the quality of the videos though .
kids today just do n't know what real cartoons are or about . they have no idea just how fun it is to watch are real cartoon .
love the movie . love anything patrick swayze played in . demi moore was excellent in this movie . i cried all the way thru .
i found this movie disturbing so i did n't watch it the whole way . maybe it got better but would not try to watch it the whole way through again .
this was even more like the books than the originals . the characters and the background information were very well done .
a nice movie and i also liked the extras that were added . it really was cute and interesting . love the digital copy
for some reason i did n't finish watching the story . do n't know if it was me or the movie . others may enjoy it .
this brings back a lot of childhood memories ! i loved this series of cartoons , bought and it was the best thing ever . now i need to grab the rest of the seasons to complete my collection .
even if i could try to explain this film , it wo n't be enough . it ca n't be explained . it 's beautiful art .
i was n't really expecting much out of this movie but quickly found out it was funny and entertaining . great comedy action flick . saw it on instant amazon and quality came in perfectly .
interesting characters , a good storyline , and funny at times too ; this was more of a drama than a comedy , and had a good moral to the story .
horrible dvd ! what a waste of money ! no one that has watched it has ever watched the complete movie ! absolute garbage !
my daughter and son both love this dora movie . animals and dora , could it get any better ? they do n't think so ! : )
the price was a little high but i ca n't really except less since i bought a christmas movie 2 weeks before christmas but otherwise i have had no problems with it
this is one of the most underrated horror movies of all time . there is n't much to be said besides watch this movie if you have n't seen it yet .
i really enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to anyone . well worth the money spent . it 's an all round feel good movie
it was an interesting movie . very sad but different . surprise after surprise . good photography . too much time smoking as many directors think is necessary for some unknown reason .
my favorite halloween movie just the best of everything . fun historical facts , dark humor , creepy characters and just the right amount of blood and violence .
the movie was comical with some romance thrown in for good measure . i liked it . quirky , but cool . worth the rental price .
good price and bought it for the digital copy . i 've seen it a few times now when traveling and never disappoints .
it 's a typical barbie movie so mom and dad are not thrilled but if you are a 6 year old girl it 's the best movie ever . : )
my boyfriend loves richard pryor and he was not dissapointed when i gave him this . we watched it and had a good laugh . he really enjoyed it !
love this movie , one of the best of early bruce willis . could watch over and over again . highly recommend viewing .
good and complete ending , from beginning to end i have watched with anticipation the story unfold as to what will happen , and how this will all end .
great ! the only thing that i still have n't got use to the menu at the front instead of playing the movie without having to make choice first .
this movie was very enjoyable . was very entertaining to watch , and i ca n't say that about too many movies anymore . would recommend for a light , entertaining movie night .
okay i find tom and cameron annoying as a people , yes that is right , but this film rocked it big ! fun fun fun ... what a ride . a must see ! !
it was a good addition to the bourne trilogy . the movie followed the book pretty good . i would recommend this to add to your movie collection .
thank you for helping to complete my collection of & # 34 ; bones ' seasons . my granddaughters and i like to watch them together .
as a big fan if the books i was excited to see this played out on screen . disappointed that many important aspects were changed from the book , but overall it was entertaining .
all three were good movies , but of course my reason for buying it was color of night ! the price was very reasonable and the quality was new !
great idea to put both movies on 1 dvd . both are excellent movies .
the special effects are fantastic . the grandchildren love to watch the movie . we have watched it about 5 times already
i was n't sure how good this movie was going to be , but it turned out to be a great story . i really enjoy this movie .
awesome movie . great acting , action and story line . hard to believe it 's all a true story . funny how reality can be so crazy . i would highly recommend this movie .
yeah nothing but good things to say about this movie love it watch it over and over , was a great find on here for a great price
this movie was great , my children watched this when they were younger and now our grandchildren like it as well . great movie .
this move is my most favorite , it is a true story and i just wonderful . i watch it all the time , ca n't get enough
here are two great shows for the family that will become classics in your household at christmas . disney out did themselves with these two shows .
great movie or mini series and it should be a classic for sure . would recommend this western to anyone . robert duvall and tommy lee jones were great together .
this movie although written as fiction is probably the most realistic picture of the times that we live in . i will definitely be buying part 2. it was well worth the money .
this is an excellent series . very good actors , good costumes and the story takes you back to the period . it is very interesting and i can hardly wait for each new episode
what 's better than julia roberts and richard gere ? ? this is one of my favorite movies . this was a good buy too . ca n't beat that ! !
i like the original sharon stone and michael douglas acted good together . the new story is exciting or interesting like the original .
i bought this movie just because i did not have the opportunity to watch it at the cinema . i was really impressed how good it its . great story , great picture , great sound .
my sister asked me to buy this . she is 9 years old and loves disney films ... i remember watching this when i was a kid too .
the mission impossible movies are great action movies and tom cruise is one of the best action actors of all-time .
loved the movie and russell crowe . lots of action and great cinematography . well worth owning on blu ray which made the action sequences much better than ordinary dvd .
great movie , love tom hanks & julie roberts . very fitting story for the times , a must see flick . tom hanks does a great job of acting once again ... .
good to view but the young set do not appreciate it like we did in our younger days .
wasted some time watching this . i skipped most of it after 15 minutes of watching . dumb , please do n't waste your time .
bad movie all the way through , poor acting not scary did not enjoy at all would never rent are watch again .
another great classic movie . i remember when this first came out and i liked it then and i still like it .
although the animation is great as always , this story is not my favorite of all the tinker bell movies . but young children will enjoy it anyway .
they did a good job of acting like they always do and the storyline is very good . very suspenseful and keep you on the edge of you seat .
i love the idea of & # 34 ; what if & # 34 ; that 's what this movie is all about and bonus it 's a musical too .
was very disappointed in this movie did not do harrison ford justice and it did not explain enough about why things were being done like they are
this a great movies and being in 3d was even better . i love the action in this movies too . highly recommend this movies to everyone who love the superman series .
this film is great if you are looking for a thriller film to watch . otherwise , you may be disappointed .
the movie is a different take on what a & # 34 ; zombie & # 34 ; is and i loved it . it is full of suspense and mystery .
i really enjoy watching this movie , i laugh a lot and i ca n't wait for the second movie to come out .
even as i enjoyed it 30 years ago , my kids are enjoying it today . also , a lot of good morals taught in this version , unlike many cartoons today .
had forgotten how entertaining this animation is . one liners flying all around and the small scary stuff really mix well for great viewing .
loved the movies , needed to update my collection with dvds ( in place of vhs ) . nice set . fun series of movies .
my boys and i really enjoyed this movie . it did not disappointment me like some sequels do . i look forward to hunger games 3
this was really a deal . this was a short lived series and this is the 2 seasons for a great price . i enjoyed it a lot .
what more can you say ... it is the batman . you ca n't go too far wrong if you have a good story and good animation to back it up . that 's what you will find here .
i really like the premise and the stories and the genre of the series . i never watched it until now . it 's really a terrific show ... ... ... ..
you will want to watch it over and over . holds close to the bible so , you can feel you are learning while being entertained ! ! !
been waiting to get a copy of this for a long time now . it 's all good ! ! ca n't say enough . thanks ! !
would recommend this movie if you are a john travolta fan . it is a tear jerker and he dances in this one too .
great film with bob hope and james cagney . dvd quality is pretty good in this selection from the bob hope film collection . however , it is only presented in a full screen version .
they said it was redford in the film , but who was that man in this film . i 've seen redford in many films before . this was not him . horrible movie .
i loved reading the book , and these stories are just as great , if not better ... what fun ! i highly recommend this series .
i love deniro and i think he 's a fantastic actor . his movies are all very very good !
beautiful romantic movie . good karate action , good entertaining storyline . another movie i can look at over and over again and not get tired of it .
i like the film . it was entertaining to watch . it made me laugh . i recommend this film to all who like to laugh .
john wayne acting like he does any other movie . a great western . has a little love story in it as well .
the 3 stories was good not the scariest but entertaining . i recommend this movie to those who do n't like horror movies .
johnny depp was worth the rental . found his role amusing but not enough `` camp '' to save this movie . watch the original to enjoy the drama and humor .
i have been watching this collection for a while and finally found it at the right price . i am waiting for my mash viewing marathon to begin !
this was better than i expected , tied in to the others quite well . f f f f f f f f
i saw this movie when i was younger . not the best martial arts movie but still fun to watch . found it at a good price so i purchased it .
a childhood favorite and i got a little nostalgic that 's why i purchased this . it is a cute movie .
the program appeared unrealistic . the plot appeared to be very poorly written . a lot of the scenes were contrived and implausible .
this is the greatest movie ever . the standard dvd does n't come with commentary , so this version is worth the extra money .
saw this as a little girl . loved the film them , love it now . so glad to have it . the dvd is in perfect condition . thank you so much . got here in record time .
it is an happy and exciting , funny movie but has a terrible ending that is dark and confusing . not worth the watch , because i am sure there are much better movies of marilyn monroe .
had no idea - must not have read the description that close . but it is quite cute ! showing it in my class since i can not find a french version hope the students like it .
we already had this movie in blu-ray and thought it would be a good one in 3d . it is and worth the difference in price .
i was bored one night and decided to watch the movie , not great but a good way to pass an evening .
best season with so much action . great attention to details . storyline was well thought out and great to follow as well .
the writers really thought a lot of themselves , they were trying to make another `` 10 '' or something . i could n't even get through the first 20 minutes .
really like this show , is refreshing to see that in todays tv shows . watch this show i 'm sure you 'll love it !
i have always enjoyed watching cher movies -- this one was a really good show and i enjoyed watching it again after all this time
this movie is for all people if you have faith or not , it 's a good father hood movie and family movie as will .
great movie . good plot ; costuming very much in keeping with the era . takes you back in time . great for those interested in world war ii events .
i like this movie . you either like it or you do n't , patrick stewart and cast take us on a ride . it was fun !
this is a great movie , i own the first on , so of course i wanted the second one . the buyer is someone i would make a purchase from in the future .
this is one of my favorite anime series of all time . i 'm glad that it was reasonably priced and that i was able to order them all at the same time . : )
this story is so amazing ! everyone has a second chance . we need to believe in others ! love this movie and would recommend it for everyone !
got this for my niece , she is a huge fan of the show . i sat and watched it with her and now i must say i am a fan .
i 've watched both the death bell movies and i favor the first one over this one . this one disappointed me .
love this genre , scream is great . funny and scary at the same time , watch regularly .
this is a good western movie to watch . this is a family movie no sex and understanding of how life of three women from the east were treated and one woman 's life changed .
i bought this for my girlfriend because it brought back childhood memories . the movie is a great watch and comical . definitely worth it .
one of my all-time favorites . i love all of harrison ford 's movies . the price was great , fast shipping , love it , thank you .
my husband and i enjoyed the movie very much , the movie arrived on time just as they said it would .
i and the family really enjoyed the movie . very touching and good to find something not filled with foul words .
this has always been my favorite of the pink panther movies . there was no one like peter sellers , he was the best ! !
the best yet ; sad to see one of the main characters killed in a car accident any chance he will come out of this alive remains to be seen
loved it , a great mix of humor and heartwarming scenes . i wish i had watched this one before despicable me 2 , but they were both great .
this movie is different for sure but lots of action , , , i do n't know about you but i am into this kind of movies
i purchased this for my nephews birthday . he loves old cartoons just like me and my brother watched when we were little . this is a great example of old cartoons my nephew loves it .
i love watching audie murphy . the westerns that audie murphy made are the ones that i like the best from his collection .
so amazingly funny - great pair up and chemistry with bullock and mccarthy and i really , really , really , hope they do more stuff together - one of the best movies i 've seen in a long time
i wore the tapes of these movies out . i was so glad to see that the dvd collection was available . i would recommend this collection to anyone who enjoys the classic horror movies from the 50s .
first time i watched this movie i did n't realize where this movie was going until the very end . good movie .
why did i buy this ? neither me , my daughter or girlfriend liked this . after the only one scene my grandaughter liked `` where is mickey ? ''
see the original marilyn ! this is a great old show ! very silly . black & white ! i love these older shows . this is great to watch with the whole family ! another must have !
season 2 gets even more in depth & involved in king henry 's life . you start to understand how the king thinks .
saw it when i was a teenager and enjoyed it then ; now i have the dvd and can enjoy it and introduced it to my grandchildren who are teens .
very touching heartfelt movie about love of family when facing the most horrible situation that any of us could ever imagine . this movie is a gem and a must see for anyone
sometimes these episodes seem to last longer than an hour , but they definitely draw you in . several twists in this season that i did n't see coming , so you 've been warned !
i was really surprised just how good this movie was . action , and a little bit of comedy . it is worth watching .
`` when theres no more room in hell , the dead will walk the earth '' that gets 5 stars alone , this will make a great gift or even an addition to a collection .
i love robert redford . he has so much charm . this is a fun movie to be enjoyed over and over .
the first time i watched this movie i thought it was hilarious , so when i saw it i had to get it .
very good movie lots of good acting and great horror at its best . you will want to see this movie
i have always enjoyed this movie and i finally added it to my collection ! great cast and performance ! creepy and scary ! ! : )
this was a fun film and i really enjoyed it . thank you for making it available for purchase . enjoy watching it .
i got this dvd for my children for halloween . 5 yrs old and 7 yrs old and they both love it . we have watched it a lot during october . i am glad i purchased it .
not as good as the orginal , but plenty of action . the romantic story got in the way of the plot in this one but not so much that you could n't enjoy it .
lets get the rest of the series out there for us to enjoy before we get too old to enjoy . and what happened with the rest of happy days ?
watched it was n't that impressed . i have seen better but it was good for an afternoon with popcorn and company .
loved this movie a long time ago . it is a bit dated now , but still worth watching . glad i got it .
not really a good movie for young children . the makeup was great but , i think , too scary for youngsters . the story was where you want to cheer on the young main character ... yay !
each cartoon just gets better and better i love everyone of these movies and i hope they never stop making these classics .
this dvd is in great condition when i received it and the picture and sound quality is excellent for an old charlie chan movie .
excellent scifi movie for the whole family ! absolutely fun to watch with kids . the story on the human side is a little weak but everything else is good .
cheesy . bad graphics which is fine if your story is good enough . but ... it 's not . nor are the actors really great . have it an honest chance but just could n't get into it .
this was a movie for our 12 year old . it was a great film which we viewed together and she requested having her own copy for christmas . she loves it .
not very funny . long . would n't recommend it . fun cast of actors but the movie was n't very funny . not one i would rewatch
love brad pitt and love westerns . great movie showing how it really was . it 's a piece of history that shows the real side of the cowboy heroes
i love kathy . i love her tv show and i have seen her live . this dvd delivers and does she . that is all you need to know .
dvd itself was brand new . i 'd just forgotten the movie was n't as good as i thought . was more interesting 40 years ago !
a western with sam elliott , it ca n't possible be bad . actually , my husband and i both enjoyed this movie and it had some surprises in it .
she a special person who i look up to she make me laugh with they way she acts i like the way she take action madea is one cool woman
this is well worth buying for a mash fan ! ! we have all the seasons on dvd and love them .
definitely worth the money ! a quality dvd classic ! one of my favourite movies . gregory peck was always great ! i would recommend it .
what can i say about this movie ? absolutely a good movie . i would recommend this movie . a must see movie .
why bother making a sequal movie like this . disney should never made a update movie after wizard of oz .
awesome movie . i have the saga and i will treasure this edition as all of my other ones ! thank you so very much .
the movie arrived in awesome shape and very fast ! very pleased with the product and the timing ! the movie is funny and plays perfectly clear !
acting was better than a lot of movies i have seen recently . story was good . i felt involved in the story and its got lincoln killing vampires . what more can u want from a movie
my daughters first real movie - she loved it . i do n't really need to write another great review - there are a ton already .
the blu-ray version is awesome , combined with the one of the greatest dancing musicals of all time makes it more awesome .
this is a great newer movie . the old guys win again ! great actors . good plot . bruce gets the girl again !
i watched 3 shows but was bored . the lead actress was annoying and while the writing was good , this show did nothing for me . i may need to watch it again .
i have enjoyed what i have seen of it , but my husband has really enjoyed the lone ranger series . a great product for lone ranger fans .
the performances were wonderful it was like you were in the audience and they kept you entertained through the whole disc
football fighting good storyline got ta see this one , well worth it . a violent ballet of great acting well made fighting scenes
bought this for my son for christmas . he really loves the friends season . and it is a good gift to share with the whole family too
i love all these thrillers , these are classics and must see . the acting and the story line is top quality .
i ca n't wait for the next episode of the show each time that i watch one . very high quality and i love it !
watching this a 2nd time around does n't make it any less wonderful . this is and always will be a classic .
love this movie . it 's been so long since i seen it . so i enjoy it so much . would recommend it to anyone who love lifetime movies . would order from this seller again .
it my favorite movie watch it more than 100 times when i was little i really love it ! i got it on time !
just bought a blue ray dvd player . loved the movie `` cars '' and wanted to see it in its best quality . was well worth the purchase . color and intensity of graphics are so much better
this is a cute , funny , clean movie with a nice message . the acting is great . it gives a little insight into the college scene . relax , and enjoy this one !
we usually love just about anything with steve martin in it , and we were n't disappointed with this movie either . it 's both funny and sentimental . we love it !
this is essential to the rest of the series . you need to watch it to learn what happened to the characters later in their lives .
it was okay . i thought it was going to have more action but it was quite slow in places . acting was good and had a good story line .
i really enjoyed this film . it is n't the best film ever made , but was great for a friday night in .
it was a great movie . the acting was great and the story was exciting . i would recommend this action movie .
people , i 'm sure i speak for everyone when i say this is an all time classic . the people who made this on dvd should know that !
well , l we have all the previous seasons on dvd . we just love the show and this season is as good as the previous six .
this is a masterpiece . it 's as simple as that . it 's albert brooks ' very best film . no film fan should miss it .
this movie is just fun . lopez is great . i never was a fonda fan but she was good too . liked this movie a lot .
it 's a pretty good film -- mainly because of johnny depp . a few holes in the plot , a few predictable moments , but overall entertaining .
just made you feel good in the christmas spirit . the product was in great shape and the service was awesome .
i am giving this movie three stars . i thought it was a great movie and had a good story line !
rarely a remake of a previous movie is worth watching . this was creative and entertaining . a good rainy day movie .
i saw on the internet , i enjoyed it . so i look for this dvd and i brought it . the story is good and enjoyed it .
the second series is also good and worth watching the development of the characters . the main leads are growing and it is not as expected .
i , myself did not like the movie . looked at it once , and put it away . i know more people will find it to their liking , but not i .
i finally got the out of print godzilla dvd took forever for it to drop down on the damn price range !
no matter what dean martin does his great . wish i could get all of his shows and movies and his music .
a relatively light hearted movie that was an enjoyable view without having to struggle with the plot . old but good .
this movie to me does n't have the action of the original king kong but if u like the original film then this is good to have for your collection
i wanted to add this movie to my dvd library and of course , i love the movie . i always enjoyed the tv series and this is just plain fun to watch .
as usual , when ever a critic says that something is bad , it usually turns out not to be that way .
i chose this because it looked interesting and it was , i liked the story , the way the animals talked and worked together . i would recommend it to anyone .
it was received timely , and in new condition as advertised , however , i did n't care for the movie - i found it to be very depressing .
great product exactly as described ! ! gave as a gift he loved the movie and excellent quality as well ! he said the movie was awesome
john wayne is my all time favorite actor . this series is some of his best work . i would be happy to recommend this to anyone .
ok storyline . not suspenseful . i kept waiting for the suspense but none happened . almost could be funny but was n't . if you have nothing else to watch .
this copy played beautifully and i like stargate and i wanted a better playing copy than the dvd i had . so , i gave that copy to my son . recommend this if you like science fiction .
i liked the story and the special effects like realistic dinosaurs . i like the idea of time travel on earth .
it was very good . kind of slow paced and lots of good jokes but do n't expect a lot of action . not that kind of movie
this is an amazing true story , beautifully told , good acting . i have it on vhs tape , and was so grateful to now have it on dvd so i can watch it .
i enjoyed every episode and hated when it was over . aaron paul is adorable . i would like to see more series like that one .
omg this movie will keep your attention through the entire movie i mean all the way up until the credits roll .
great story line , easy to follow . sandra bullock is one of the best actresses , and i watch all of her movies .
we love watching this show on tv and had to get the first two seasons for our house to watch whenever we want too ! : )
we 've ordered several tv series , and this is one of the best , we have really enjoyed it and only hate it ended without there being more series . was worth it . thank you
this is a movie that makes you almost laugh all the time . there is no profanity or bad pictures . go buy it today .
hey there all . just want to let you all know that this is a great deal . go for it . later .
looked for this at an affordable price for a few years - great classic movie . i ca n't stay interested enough to read the books , so this works very well for me .
very well done . seen it before . dicaprio does a great job as a soldier in africa . four more words ok .
my daughter absolutely loved this movie ! she would probably watch it every day if i 'd let her . definitely worth the purchase !
it was another kinda cheesy movies but i did enjoy it very much it at least had a plot to it
i watched this movie before going to see the movie with the same actress in it . i decided not to see it even though i really like sandra bullock . just too much .
i love this movie ! the look of the movie is what should be expected for an older movie , just a little more vibrant . no extras , just the movie .
awesome dvd ! arrived in excellent condition and was very fast and so worth it ! i am very pleased and would give you ten stars if i could ! thank you ! : )
my daughter & i started watching grey 's from the beginning - still loving it ! now ... looking forward to season 10 dvd set : ) !
i love this movie . it takes me back to more innocent years as a teenager . sometimes it nice to let the present go .
she loves the series . i could take it or leave it , but if it makes the wife happy . as the saying goes & # 34 ; happy wife , happy life & # 34 ; .
i absolutely loved this show , and i am so glad i can watch dvd 's since the show was cancelled . i have the first 3 seasons , and love all of them ! !
give it a chance and watch it please i dont give good reviews but give it a chance ok please
one of my new favorite shows i like to watch with my husband so buying it on dvd was definitely a must .
though i did n't love this final season i do love the show . four stars , three if their would have been following seasons .
pbs stopped right after the baby was born . went back to season one . i was really happy to be able to see the rest rather than wait to see if pbs would finally get to it .
this is one of my favorite tom hanks movies . it is very funny . a very good movie .
this was one of my favorite series and i am now able to rewatch it as many times as i wish to .
i love the office ! if you have n't watched the series , i highly recommend that you do ! one of the funniest tv shows that i have ever watched !
fun for all ages . this movie brings christmas up to modern day technology . it is heart warming and has a great ending . great family flick .
this is the third time i have told you that i was unable to watch this video . region free dvd player did not work .
my kids love the super hero movies and this did not disappoint . it was a christmas day hit . i got it for a great price too .
still a very good movie , but it 's better on the actual stage . but save your money and see this version instead . it 's still pretty good .
i bought this movie for my sister and have n't watched it myself yet . i do n't know if i would recommend this movie or not .
wonderfull dvd . raymond burr is wonderfull as perry mason . a must have for that perry mason person in you . enjoy .
you have to write too much . i did not personally watch this dvd but my daughter did and she loves it .
i thought this had the potential to be a great movie but i found it to be just ok .
this was a wonderful movie and very well done i must said i love this kinda movie with all my heart . you better watch it soon
this is as good as the rest . as with all the x men movies this is a good one . lots of action with humor mixed in . the whole family enjoyed it . great to watch .
again , i 'd watch anything elvis did . a decent actor and absolutely a gorgeous young man . gone but not forgotten . sad .
a very fun movie . this is the kind of movie you can not think to much about , you just have to set back and enjoy it .
if you are a billy crystal fan , you will love this movie . i think it is one of his best .
excellent movie , and i now see why it has lasted over so many years . i enjoyed the movie and it had a good story line and plot to it .
i truly enjoyed this movie and it was money well spent . this movie shows what is going to happen in the end times which i believe we are here !
this series is action packed . it tries to bring to life what it was really like , but like i stated before 4 guys could never beat 100 guys .
i really liked the origin , so when trying to bring back memories of the past it kind of seemed lacking . i wish it would have been more of a remake of the original .
i 've always enjoyed 24 and sutherland . this one is especially good . i would recommend it to anyone that likes action .
neil diamond at his best , captured for my personal enjoyment . i may have to buy more for my family and friends .
i 'm not a big hugh jackman fan but this is a great story . well written , well acted , nicely balanced , and has a positive ending - sort of ...
i did n't even finish watching this . it could not hold my interest at all . would not recommend it to anyone .
only put 4 stars just because my son did n't seem as into it as i though he would . very good learning dvd for kids . great price ! fast delivery
we had seen this movie in the theatre , and when we shared it with friends whom had n't seen it before , we all enjoyed it as a group .
another good movie from steven seagal . i 've watched this one several times , too , and am still liking it very much .
this is just a really good watch . not the best , but fun around christmas time . definitely a keeper you 'll enjoy for a long time .
suspend your sense of reality . good action and i liked the actors . i would recommend it to anyone who enjoys fantasy and a happy ending .
top 10 sports movies all-time . there are several messages in the film ... wrapped around a baseball theme . it 's a must watch .
this was a good family movie that we rented from amazon . it was n't extraordinary , but i was happy to not worry about curse words .
i am so pleased with the purchase of the 4th season of father knows best . this is what i consider quality television viewing . ca n't wait to own the entire series .
a fun and unique movie . seems to want to be like the princess bride . not as good as that , with more adult themes . still a good movie though
another 1 off the list . trying to get all the disney movies as soon as they are released on blu ray
i have always liked veggie tales from when they first came out . i love that they have all of the different stories for kids to learn things in an easy to understand way .
this movie is a cult classic . if you you like brutal fight oriented animation this is the movie that set the bar .
i rated it this high because the description of the product was right on the money . i appeared to be band new .
i love the old spongebob . i have this vhs tape . it is good one , has lots of the classic episodes . better than the spongebob today , the new one stinks .
fascinating story based on true events over several decades and how their lives connect . excellent acting by the 4 main stars .
i will be honest i like this because the nudity . this is not for kids . this movie is about a boy about 18 and his friends .
saw this movie on tv in the 70s and remembered today how much i enjoyed it back then . the dvd did not let me down . was delivered in a timely manner and in great shape .
this was the beginning of all that is wonderful in the ncis world . love to be able to watch it from the start .
fast action . was as good as the first taken movie . sometimes second movie is not as good as first . this one was
i wanted it to be longer of course , but this gave a person with a limited knowledge of the series a good idea of some of the action and suspense involved .
i enjoyed this as a child and was excited to get it for my daughter . she enjoys the movie as well and loves to dance and sing along .
this film is absolutely hilarious for reasons too numerous to list . i ca n't remember a time when i laughed so hard ! don knotts rocks ! ! !
i got this and love it . now getting them all for my halloween collection . nice having a family series for the holidays . this fits the bill .
excellent movie so much going on you have to watch it several times to see everything . i have the set and it is fun to watch them all in a day
the classic films included in this collection are wholesome and worthwhile for every member of the family . we have thoroughly enjoyed watching and re-watching each of them ...
this has been beautifully restored and the blu ray version is so clear . this is a must have for christmas .
a great classic ! it could not be better ! this is something you should have in your dvd collection ! excellent !
i ca n't say enough great things about this show ! this is acting and writing at its very best . this season is a knock out and reminded me why i love this show .
you ca n't go wrong with this flick , just sit back and enjoy . there are just a lot of talented people here doing everything right ,
its funny . i think all of these comedians was on the old comic view shows .
great movies , my grandkids love them and all are good story lines . i have enjoyed watching them as well . the movies are old ones but the message is good .
excellent movie ! very moving and powerful . i have n't read the book but after watching the movie i definitely want to .
i like this show . it was entertaining and a bit different than most lawyer shows i have watched . so far so good .
this is a touching movie that shows what teaching is all about ! there will be all types of emotions from sadness to laughter ! excellent movie !
one of my favorites . just what i needed . arrived right on time . a must have . a great buy at a great price . 2 thumbs up .
i always enjoyed any movie about outer space . this one was very interesting & had beautiful scene 's . even the very beginning with the apes .
this movie was a disappointment really . i thought it would be alot better but it was okay .
not what i expected . was very disappointed . thought this was a cute cartoon about the peanuts gang . would not recommend to anyone !
ugh . great stars but how wrong they turned ... with a poor director . acting is weird and stiff and i just did n't get the `` plot '' ... very confusing .
great actors , acting , and writing . not like your everyday , ordinary cop shows . nothing like usual cop shows shows that are on tv .
i enjoyed watching perry mason when i was little , and on reruns when i got older . always a good show .
yeah , i really like this film . definitely a must see if you are a fan of science fiction . bruce willis is also one of my favorite actors . buy it now ! ! !
scary in it 's own way because it 's happening right now ! great movie ! we are being watched , get used to it .
given that the movie is based on real life events , it was enjoyable . it was suspenseful when it needed to be , and a good mix of drama and comedy ( ok , dry comedy ) .
i loved all the characters in this movie and chose this rating because no matter what , i love christmas movies . some more than others . those i loved more than others i bought !
while not following the comics much at all , this take on the first group of x-men was very good . i 'm really looking forward to the next installment in the series .
it was worth waiting for . the blu-ray is the definitive edition of this beloved family classic that many of us first saw when we were children .
i love tyler and this sitcom is one of his best especially mr. brown . this is hilarious and also with a great storylines
did not get to see it , i had to buy it for the library for a replacement of 1 that was stolen !
under rated band except by those who followed them back in the day . this is said to be their best live concert dvd . i got this as a gift .
loved this movie as a kid and enjoyed it just as much watching with my god daughter ! def . a classic !
this movie was amazing ! the fear of space is brought to life as we follow sandra bullock on her journey to get back home .
we love watching these movies . alice is one of our favorite characters . we own them all . very good movies , if you like that sort .
i would definetly consider watching frozen . its a cute stories with lots of lovable characters and a great soundtrack . its a feel good family movie .
this thing is in search of more than a director ; it needs a story line . an ending would help too .
this is an excellent series . we thoroughly enjoy watching each episode . we ca n't wait for each new season to become available .
this was not my kind of movie . you would have to see for yourself . i can or ca n't recommend it right now . maybe l have to view it again .
i did n't really care for the movie would not watch again . [ bought because of the reviews . i like true stories . maybe it was n't my taste
we were unable to see this when it originally showed at the theatre , but we are glad we bought the dvd . we really enjoyed the whole movie , and were pleased with the service we received .
this is nothing like the board game i grew up with but it was still good sci fi action movie
that the movie was sexy and weird . the make up jobs are great . the acting and special effects could be better
my daughter read the book she said it was alot better . brought this for christmas she saw the movie was alittle dissapointed
i always enjoy a good thriller that gives us an option to those awful comedy shows on tv these days !
we love harry potter here . this is another great movie in the series . as almost always the case , the book is better , but the movie is still well worth watching .
this is a great science fiction movie that you will love to watch with your friends . will keep you in your seat .
this is just act ii of the play . it is ok because of the stars but is is not as good as the first
john cusack is so adorable and sweet and i love kate 's accent . very cute story and good romance movie . chick flick , of course , but you still got ta love it .
the actors are top notch and the story was great . lots of action and thrills . a great movie for movie night .
i grew up watching the old batman tv series and reading the comic books , so i love batman . this movie is actually pretty good .
one of the best zombie movies i have seen in a while . good story line , good acting and lots of suspense to keep your attention to the screen .
the book arrived in the time frame given and was a great read . i love comedies and this movie was hilarious . i read the book and think the movie was worth the buy .
i just love this movie . it 's sweet , a little sad and has all the drama needed to make it a good movie .
do n't remember getting it -- must have been a gift - sorry i did n't let you know something sooner - thanks
being a lover of old films & stars i collect them on dvd when the price is right to add to my collection .
i absolutely loved this movie . bought a copy of it too . the cgi is breath taking and the story powerful . ca n't wait for the follow-up .
one of his best shows it is funny and series and very interesting to see how it will end then you are ready to watch it again ...
this collections gets you into the holiday spirit . we watch them every year and it never seems to get old .
surprisingly , a pretty good flick . low budget , but filmed very well - and the story line is pretty creative ! definately worth a watch .
good science fiction , but not really an original enough story ... visual effects are worth seeing , more originality and depth please .
fun movie . terrible premise , but if you are into movies with decent action and great visuals it is worth checking out . in hd .
i am so happy to have this on dvd . our family would sit together and watch this movie when we wanted to laugh . great cast .
i actually purchased this to give a friend . so i can not tell you anything about it . but i do n't think they would have requested without hearing good things about it ! ! !
i was skeptical about renting this , i am not a huge dwayne johnson fan . but i was pleasantly surprised ! i actually ended up buying it on blu-ray
the doctor is back , and he 's saving the world again ! well worth watching over and over again ! great sci-fi adventure !
this is the one of the best madea movies i 've seen . tyler perry makes this character funny , outrageous , but still holds her character together .
a movie i will watch again and again . it is a love story that is very sad yet probably with a lot of truth .
i did not like this movie at all . sorry for the writer ( s ) . not worth your money . no no
my child watched these at school sometimes and was in love with them . so we got it for home so everyone could watch it . it 's a decent kids ' movie .
takes me back to when things were simpler and my kids were little ! great fun , beautiful costumes , cute story lines .
i would n't say that this is the best sequel to a movie but it was still really good . great action scenes and glad to see that most of the original cast is back for the second movie .
my children wanted this for christmas so i ordered out a few and made everyone happy .
a movie you will want to share with your kids over and over , this movie is a must have for any family .
i ordered for a friend -- she wanted it for her grandson . her grandson is very happy with it and has watched it more then once ! !
the dvd was clear . i enjoyed this movie because of the historical view point of view . also the movie was very entertaining .
of course the original was a great movie ! this one is ok. not great , not horrible . it was worth watching once . i can watch original several times .
the dvd arrived promptly and was just what i expected ! it is a classic christmas movie and a must for my collection !
the movie was great . there was scenes in the movie i never seen on any of the movie channels or on tv . i enjoy the major league movies .
we watched this movie because the 2nd one is being released soon and wanted to see this first . overall , the movie is pretty good .
liked the first season of this show so watched the second season on at a time . this third season is more of the same good characters and interesting plot lines .
i enjoyed the audio only version of this performance better . still funny but it 's not a dvd i would own .
i can recall watching this film on tv . it was entertains and well made .
was an ok tv movie i guess could have been much more a little predictable too ...
for me this is like a new classic film . i was skeptical about the cast but i left the theater impressed and wanting to watch it again and again .
shows you alot about walmart , some things you could never imagine , and what happens to keep the prices so low ...
it is one of the best action movie of this era . i would recommend . matt is a superb actor , who gave the movie class .
my best george clooney movie , warm , funny , a subject that many of us unfortunately can relate to . would recommend this film to friends and family .
brings me back to the 70 's watching this series . some of the acting was a little hokey but overall i enjoyed it thoroughly .
this was one of my favorite movies of last year and the kids could not wait for it to come out on blue ray .
i like having a copy of this to go back to and watch every now and then . it 's such a great movie .
my wife love 's this series and this one is no exception . quality , clean , and a great message . highly recommended for family viewing .
lots of violence as you would expect from a 007 movie . good thriller . not for the faint of heart or easily upset by all the violence .
this a wonderful dvd to add to any dvd collection . if you like heart warming movies , this is one i would highly recommend you buy .
the best scary movie i 've seen in a long time . great story line , great actors , great ending . will definitely watch again
excellent wrap up of the earlier star wars movies . while the ending will surprise no one , it is well done . could there be more ? ? ? ?
we really enjoyed watching this movie . it was a lot of fun . my husband did n't like the first one , but he had fun at this one .
rather ordinary , a bit long and drawn out ... found it did not hold my interest . would n't rave about it to others at all .
loved this movie ! they are both really funny in different ways but she is a riot ! the previews do n't do it justice . hilarious
i love this movie . i can watch this one over and over again . this will always be in my collection !
brad pitt . need i say more ? i do n't remember the whole movie by heart because i 've only seen it once .
loved the music , dancing , so many stars ! highly recommend for those who love classic film musicals featuring so much talent .
one of those rare movies with great acting and a great script ! i do n't buy many movies but will buy this one . note , this movies is n't for everyone and some will say it sucked !
i enjoy this company and the dvds they produce . i have several and i have yet to be disappointed . worth the price too !
shipping was quick ! i received this days before i thought i would . these are my favorite movies and i am thrilled to now own them and can watch whenever i want .
disappointing , but i did n't know the story before seeing this , not my thing as it is too sad for me , too dark
good story , very predictable but i like that . good acting . i prefer these old movies to the things they make these days . black and white does n't bother me
this is one of my favorite series . it is well written and all of the actors give an excellent performance .
i 'm amazed how this is still powerful today , as in the beginning . hope they would make this full screen also , like when it first came out .
i liked the fact that the horse tells the story . the cinematography was stunning . this movie would be suitable for young children .
great movie , good message . it 's got a great cast too . perfect for your kids . i really enjoyed it . you will too .
a documentary mixed in with the concert footage . i would have rated this concert dvd higher if the documentary footage was n't mixed in with the concert footage .
we just recently bought this movie and like all of the barney shows and movies we were n't disappointed . its all just good clean fun
love this movie . got tired of waiting for it to be available at the library . had to have my own copy .
good piece of history . wish there were more than 60 minutes to the video . very educational and poignant . everyone interested in music should watch it .
i loved this show when it ran on tv and was thrilled to find it at such a great price . was very pleased with delivery time and condition . would order from again .
love the characters and the story . those old movies are the best . sherlock and watson , those actors really know their stuff
not a good movie to watch , and it gets old quick and i think the rewatch value is low . the storyline is n't believable either .
this was an incredible performance by matthew mcconaughey ! he certainly earned the best actor oscar ! the subject is tough and the movie is tough to watch sometimes , but definitely worth seeing .
it was a good wholesome movie to watch . both me and my husband like it . would recommend seeing it if you get the chance .
the movie has a lot of violence but so does our history . the cast was good , the story was easy to follow but beware it is very graphic . classic movie for younger generation .
though a few are older , their message and meaning are still powerful and will help bring the christmas spirit into your home .
love this movie . audrey hepburn is just fantastic . they just do n't make great films like this anymore ! ! would highly recommend .
this is a wonderful dvd . the story is very interesting and compelling . and it is filmed in such beautiful areas . it a great film .
this is a very dramatic movie , and the acting is great . i shows the dark side of our human race and what it is like to lose your freedom .
i enjoyed this fresh way of looking at holmes in an action packed film . the turns and twists keeps your mind trying to figure out the who done it !
great cast , is something to watch for me on a rainy day . if you love westerns this one of the classic 's .
dancing and family issues , i thought it could have been much better did n't seem to give good movement through out the movie , jumped around a lot .
great movie . can watch it again and again and still cry at the end .
its good 3 disk to watch . i found the scenes to be alright . i found the acting is good but the way the scenes are needed help .
not what u think it will be it is a surprise movie i was really impressed when it turned out like it did
i loved this show and the main character . so happy to be able to watch it whenever i wish .
an interesting story , and well done , but i do n't like the morals portrayed . i suppose it could be considered a lesson in the way not to live .
i was very pleased with the speed at which i received my movie . it was in perfect condition when i received it . i would definitely order from them again . thank you .
this movie is fun for the family . it 's one of my favorites , it came to me quickly and in perfect condition . i have watched it several times with my children since .
i enjoyed this movie because i 'm a history buff . it more than met my expectations and i have watched it several times .
you know some of these low budget movies are alot better than the high budget movies this one was pretty good i 'd see it again . not a bad movie at all .
this movie was awesome . constant nonstop action . very good ! ! rented it , loved it and had to have it for my collection . could watch it over and over again .
i really wanted to like this movie , but i could n't . the premise was interesting , but that 's about where it ended . do n't waste your time or money on this dud .
i thought it was an excellent story . there were a few times that i could n't follow what was going on . hard to hear .
we both love this series . the episodes are all good and we love the characters . we do n't want it to end .
this set was a gift for my wife who has always loves the story . she seems satisfied with this box set .
i had such hopes for this movie . it wasnt horrible , but they took a lot of the charm that made the animated series so much fun to watch . it also seemed rushed .
great movie and a great cheap price too . buy this blu-ray cause i really cant see the difference from this one and the latest release , fast delivery
so much fun jason statham always plays a great action roll keeps you on the the edge of your seat
again i love this series and would recommend it to anyone & everyone . it 's worth it 's weight in gold . ca n't wait for season 4 to come out .
foyle 's war is well written . there are always more than one thing going on in the story . the characters develop with each episode .
this is a great series and i 'm glad to be able to add this to the rest of my seasons collection . great acting , story lines , and surprises . excellent ! ! !
awesome series that now can get all seven years and revisit and rewatch when nothing else on . great to see it on dvd .
awesome movie ! one of my all time favorites . i watch it a few times a year just because it makes me laugh .
it was a surprise for my son 's birthday and he loved it ! we watched this as soon as it came .
bought this for my wife , and she is a big tom fan , so she just had to have this movie . a great hit
great film the song title will have you in tears as for the film well great story and another one for your collection .a must brian
i should have rented it first and then decide to buy later but i really did not care the story behind the title . great condition and fast service . if you buy this rent it first .
each episode keeps you coming back for more . full of everything from suspense to disaster on daily basis . whats next ?
pretty poor movie . not sure what the point of the movie really was . i kept thinking that it would get better but it sure did n't .
if you want a show that has bad acting , decent plot , and not a lot of sex , this is it . worth watching one time maybe .
got to say this is great ! makes ya wonder if it could actually happen ! another one ya can see more than once !
i saw some of those matches on different dvds and but i was glad to get this one because you do n't see these any more on tv .
great movie ! lots of unexpected twists and turns ! will definitely keep you on the edge of your seat ! excellent plot !
would love to see more documentaries like this one . can you suggest any ? how about wives and families struggles during world war ii
for a movie that was done in 1950 it is wonderful . the story line seems a little trite . but the dancing is superb .
my wife and i watched it . i thought it was going to be more funny . overall , i do n't recommend watching it .
arrived quickly and in great condition . mountain played their hits and some newer stuff as well but it was all good . i would recommend this concert .
great movie ! fun , funny and sad but enjoyed so much had to watch again . really funny movie ! you 'll enjoy it
this is a first for me , i did n't like this movie and i think i only had it on for about 20 minutes . acting just was n't there .
i really look forward to watching this series . plenty of mystery , action , and adventure along with great personalities in the series characters .
it was really in good condition . the only thing i would have to say is that it was a little worn on the side . other than that it was in good condition .
my son loved some of these movies that we watched on sunday night when i was growing up . good collection
still one of the best ! i ca n't tell you how many people were surprised by the ending . watching it again , it 's still as good as the first time i saw it with my wife .
arrived very fast and in good condition . ca n't ask for more . during the xmas rush some things get lost but i was happy to see this in my mail box .
not one dull moment in this film , douglas is a master actor , the story is both funny and tragic and you will never be able to stop watching it until it 's over .
top notch martial arts with more than perfect special effects . great film to watch . bad guys lose good guys win in the end . perfect western world copy cat .
i love this series and enjoy watching it over and over . i would highly recommend it to anyone that is looking for a good wholesome show .
i absolutely love these movies . the best part is that you get new movies cheaper on here than anywhere else .
so happy this is on prime . loving this series for years and this is one of the really great seasons .
this movie is so funny and worth watching for a laugh . i got it because it is now one of my favorite movies .
truly wonderful writing and acting as well as sets - fun for all ages - my husband and i sit and watch with our 13 year old and we all ca n't wait to see veronica every week .
these movies are a great addition to my dvd collection . if you 're a fan of chuck norris , then i do n't have to tell you anymore about these . get 'em .
this is a very cute movie , mainly for kids . i did like it and recommend it if you have children .
the message of this movie is a+ . the acting however leaves a lot to be desired . i have not watched it very often .
we have watched all of the death race movies and none of them have let us down ! most sequels get pretty lame after the first two but not death race !
i loved this movie . non stop action . got it in blu-ray because i wanted better picture and sound and it does n't disappoint .
great movie with a very good plot and life lesson . worth renting , or owning for that matter . a movie you can even watch in front of the kids , which is harder to find these days .
what fun memories to see these shows again ! i was surprised at how many details i remember . future stars guest appear in many episodes . there 's even a young brad pitt . i recommend this item .
i love this movie and think it is a very nice family movie . i am not sorry i purchased it ... ... ... .very happy i added this movie to my collection .
the story is still fresh and romantic , the music very beautiful . it 's just incredible how one can see and experience musicals that are some 60 years old and still be touched by them .
psych is a great comedy series . these guys will keep you laughing for hours . you will not regret buying this series .
great disney movie ! i 'm an adult and loved it . wonderful story , very well done and full of laughs . kids will love it . recommend for whole family .
if you love mel gibson you will love this movie . the suspense will get to you . mel 's a great actor in this movie .

i purchased this movie for my son , he loves all of the fantastic four movies , any super hero movie for that matter .
enjoyed watching this again . it 's great family fun . it also brings back great memories . recommend to any one that like clean family shows .
when i was young i saw ed robinson movies i liked much better . i did n't like it all that much .
i loved this movie so much i bought several others from the same producer and found them great as well . i highly recommend this movie .
it the biggest waste of money only a couple movies the rest i do n't know what they were called at time time
not a great story or movie , but a lot of pleasing visuals and scenery i would not recommend if you are tired , you will fall asleep . .
thank you very much for a great movie at a great price . i am very happy with my purchase . i have rated this at a definite 5 star .
i 'm loving these dvds . i waited a long time to be able to afford them but it was well worth the wait and cost .
john wayne always means an excellent movie . do enjoy watching the john wayne movies thru amazon prime , as they are clear and easy to hear .
these movies are unrealistic but interesting . the story line was okay , actors for their time were good and kept in suspense . i recommend these movies .
this 'll scare you ( maybe ) -- anyway , the story will make you think ... richard gere is good and the acting is super ... loved it ! ... worth the $
i 've never read the books , and had no expectations going into this movie . all in all , it was pretty good . i thought it was intriguing and entertaining . i 'd watch it again .
this is a great movie , saw it at the theater and could not wait to get it on dvd . this is my go to movie when i had a bad day .
i 'm happy that they came out with volume 3 this show was a classic in the early 90 's for kids .
this movie is n't worth watching and the only reason i purchased it was because i was an extra in it .
great dvd and info about survival . i recommend people to get & # 34 ; a boy and his dog & # 34 ; . worth what i paid
this movie was one of the great black and white movies of its kind . it was quite different from the other time movies and i enjoyed it .
this was an excellent movie , i have thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend it to all old movie classic lovers : )
when i was a teenager i saw this movie on tv and i loved it . of course i love all war movies .
another collection on my self . its brand new and everything is working condition . arrived as stated . what more could you want .
i enjoy this period of english stories , especially mysteries . the story was a little weak , but i enjoyed it anyway .
i loved this movie . bing crosby was always such a good actor as where all the actors in this good movie . family fun for all ages .

we loved watching this with our girls ( ages 7 , 9 , & 11 ) & they really liked it . what a great show ! recommend that everyone see this set . this is my favorite one
there 's a much better movie about this same case with sean penn called fair game . this is like the lifetime version of the story .
this dvd set is just like season one great , i recommend it also . the story lines are so funny , buy it and enjoy a blast from the past
this is a very english mystery show . mostly set in college life . can be a bit slow but lots of twists and turns .
this is a real bargain . any one of the movies would be worth the price . i have gotten several different sets of this tcm series and they are worth checking out .
this is a great series as i brought vol 2 as wall and loved them both i remember them as a kid .
just a really good old standard movie . it is good for children to learn a little bit about history when they watch a movie or read a book and this does that .
i love this movie it is one of my all time favorite movies . the first time i watched i loved it
this is a classic film that my kids watch almost daily . this hd version give a nice crisp , rich colorful version that adds to the viewing pleasure . worth the price
what can you say about this series its retro and wonderful and everything i remembered a must have for collectors
the plot was a little weak , but the ending was outstanding . i liked the cast . dvd picture is good but sound could be better .
this was a birthday present for my mother and she loved it . she needed this to complete her walker collection .
very good cop drama , enjoyed the first season more . the second season seems to drag on and on about the shipping industry
i find the show very unique for anime . this makes it interesting to watch . i like it very much and can not wait to finish the series .
want to see the best series made about the 2nd world war ? want to know how a documentary series should be made ? and the narration ! essential viewing for all generations . brilliantly made .
for 2 hours , absolutely nothing happens , nothing . then the movie ends . this is absolutely one of the most boring movies i have ever seen , and i 've seen some boring movies .
easy to watch . not annoying . sweet stories of friendship and helping and fun . too many words needed needed needed needed .
enemy of the state is very suspenseful . my husband & i really enjoyed watching it . we also like the actors in the movie .
great movie , johnny depp is outstanding as always in this movie , these movies were definitely written for him , i now have all four again , they were among the ones stolen from my collection .
doris day is one of my favorites . i have almost everything she 's done . this is truly a comical movie . has some music with singing as well . very family appropriate .
i so enjoyed season 1 and was looking forward to season 2. i still like all the characters but there is too much sex being shown . i am old fashioned and i will not follow this any longer
quality ensemble acting meets engaging script in this gritty story of crime on the streets . plot twists at a quick pace keeps you glued to the seat .
as with all tyler perry movies this did not disappoint . you will laugh from beginning to end . just buy it because you will watch it again .
the series start is decent . do n't expect it to follow old story lines and you wo n't be disappointed . a pretty good buy for any marvel or just x-men fan .
this was such a wonderful series . i hated to come to the end of these dvd 's and will never understand why the show was cancelled after such a short time .
it 's so wonderful to share such inspiring movies with my grandchildren ! no worry about content , language , or dress . just enjoyment !
its great for all ages it 's funny watching the kids try to get their parents back together & they are so bad at it . sometimes , nature needs a hand .
i love this movie . it 's a great family movie . it 's cute and entertaining . you must watch this movie . you will love it ! ! ! : )
great movie great acting must see i recommend it to everyone it was one the best movies of that year
watched this as a kid . loved it then so wanted to see it again and could n't find in the stores .
i never get enough jane austen and this movie was a must purchase for me . i love the book club idea and should be in one .
we are loving it we watch several time a week , and never get tired of watching it , we will never get tired of watching jimmy stewart movies .
i liked this movie except not for the kids due to sex scene in the beginning . good acting . a feel good movie .
i love christmas movies and this one has a god story that you should always believe and take care of family
i really enjoyed this series , i am waiting for the last two seasons to go prime . great comedic performances and it just gets better as time goes on ... .
i watched this anime expecting a few different things , especially the outcome , however it was really good . i 'm a guy and i still found this to be very enjoyable . worth looking into .
it was watchable , but not sure i 'd recommend it to a friend . the wife thought it was dumb , but a good time suck for me .
a lot better then i expected . i 'm not a big zombie person but this movie kept me on the edge of my seat
it is a great movie and every one family should watch it . you will enjoy it and so will the family
good movie . good actors . i was not really sure what to expect but it was okay and us adults enjoyed it .
ca n't say much except i am a big hunger games fan and the movie followed the book quite well . now i have both one and 2. ca n't wait for 3 .
this movie was interesting enough , and a good watch if you like a twist on vampire stories , especially on a lazy sunday afternoon .
i watch and read anything jane austen and thought anne hathaway and the rest of the cast did an excellent job with this very enjoyable movie .
being a james bond fan , i like this movie , but the ending is not one of the best . still it does have a set of interesting villains !
the characters did n't have a chemistry . the plot was dry . i am sorry i paid for this . i enjoy kevin costner movies but very disappointed in this one .
which i truly liked . i took my youngest niece to see in our local movie theater . she liked it too .
great movie stands up to other disney classics . started out a little slow but by the end it was great .
i remembered it from when it was first shown in the 1950 's and it 's fantastic to now own it . a great deal .
i have been enjoying watching these starting at the beginning and having a great time . thanks for making this available for such a good price !
bought this as a gift for a friend he was excited n loved it hes a big clint eastwood fan he has a collection of his movies n he was missing this one
i love this movie . seen it so many times over the years and so going to enjoy having it in my library .
while some details were off the mark this show is the star trek of the next decade . watch and remember .
i bought this movie for my daughter . she loves it and watches it when she has friends sleep over . fun family movie .
liked this movie but its not really one i would watch over and over and over again . but the story is solid and interesting .
do n't miss this one ! ! much better than the first season . i can hardly wait for season three . the coolest series around ! i ca n't stop watching once i begin .
this movie is a great the action is fantastic and the story is great it brought a lot of actors together to make an all star cast action movie great
i can watch this movie over over and over again . thor is one of my most loved movies in the world , second to the hunger games .
i had to watch this out of loyalty and it was cute and it did last long in my mind .
one of the greatest if not greatest series on world war 2. well worth the upgrade even if you already own it on dvd .
it tries to be a comedy , needs to be edited , the script could have been better , and a bit of a weak ending definitely not the best iron man , but worth seeing
i did n't expect this movie to be all that ! but jeremy renner made it fantastic ! ! ! it was action packed and full of all different countries ! loved it ! ! !
this was a really cute movie but i did n't think it was as good as the previous ones . there was lots of adventure and hilarious moments and i did enjoy it very much .
my family and i love watching this series . the quality is excellent . we also like seeing all the shows we might have missed when it first aired .
this is a classic film . i 'm glad that i was able to find it for blu ray . must have film .
i buy a lot of space stuff , and this dvd is a great one . it gives a unique perspective and i highly recommend it .
cute quirky show , i missed this when it originally aired and am catching episodes in my free time . fun , like the narrative .
gave this as a gift . the one who got it , enjoys it and watches one every weekend .
if you believe that in another world aliens can control us then this movie is for you . it is very intense and believable .
psycho is a wonderful horror movie of its time . a classic that should be viewed by all and appreciated for the piece of art that it is .
a good copy for a dvd . i rated it only 2 stars because i found it to be rather dull .
the story line keeps going on year after year but it is down so well that i do n't mind , because it is do n't so very well .
fond memories from childhood . probably wo n't work on today 's generation of youngsters , but that 's the way it goes i guess .
it tries too hard . it does n't promise much , but it surely delivers even less .
with all new types of special effects this one was pretty good . it had a decent story line and watched it through without being bored .
good actors doing a good job . my old time favorites that are ending their acting days . a plot that is a little plausible . no surprises .
my favorite is benny hills one night video stand . that 's on golden classics . this one is hit and miss for me
like watching ncis pick up more when watching again . catch things missed when again . you also get to know the cast better .
i am in anticipation each time for each new set . just cant wait for the next one . this is a great gift for anyone .
have always wanted to see him grow into superman ... and it was finally done . just wish he 'd learned to fly a little sooner in the series .
these are hard to find on tv . they took the show off netflix for some reason . i am trying to own the entire series because it is good watch again and again ,
grandkids loved it so much that i purchased it ! it will be a favorite in our family for a long time !
if you like old westerns then you will love this one . randolph at his finest . good plot and superb acting .
love the big bang theory , wanted to learn more about them ? the actor himself is pretty funny , especially when you get to know how much they act and not acting when playing the show .
this is one of those great fight movies from the roman days ... we do n't have enough of them as far as i 'm concerned . this is one of the better ones . i loved it .
jim carey at his best are you kidding me ! this is an all time classic if comedy , a must have in your collection !
this a great movie with excellant actors , a great story , and wonderful special effects . i am very happy they made this into a blu-ray .
this is a fantastic movie . this was a very funny movie and the animation was perfect . this movie is sure to become a classic .
transformers : a great way to spend an afternoon . it is amazing with the special effects .
it had a disturbing and unexpected ending . this movie makes one think about what or who we put our trust in .
this movie as a family we all liked it , was n't sure if everyone in the family would like it but they did .
i liked the original movies but this was more true to the original story and spider man 's wit is more like how i remember the comics . a lot of fun to watch .
well it is series ... . it is what i expected . sexy female lead with many interesting character with far out ideas ... .it is entertainment .
this is a movie . it was made to entertain . just relax and watch it . its not great but its not bad .
our family enjoyed this movie two or three times at the drive in theater before it came out on dvd . we still love it . thank you !
reminds me of books i read high school . i watched all 3 season back to back in a few weeks . i wish their was a few more seasons .
product was great , condition was better than stated . arrived in a timely fashion . would absolutely use this seller again and would recommend them to anyone .
this one was my favorite . of course , it was the first one cruise did . they are always the best . great movie to add to collection .
i love this movie , it is full of action . very impressed and i watch this all the time . buy it .
not as funny . camera work was terrible at the end . no subtitles . fans would only watch this one once .
classic disney movie . love it . the kids always enjoy watching toy story over and over again . adults can enjoy as well
i love this story ! i wish it had another sequel but that would n't make sense . tarantino rocks ! i love all if his work !
the production value on this was great and the acting was good . but the story line was so campy ... .i loved it ! !
good , wholesome family horse movie for all audiences . i enjoyed it and think most would . you could feel free to show it anyone .
i ca n't praise this collection enough . the movies are truly over the top ! i will keep this collection as one of my favorites !
i love this show . so glad they have this one . i have enjoyed seeing these again . if you like british humor you will enjoy this .
i really like matthew mcconaughey who did a great job with this movie but i especially like the two boys who were featured in the movie , reese witherspoon not so much .
i have been a huge fan of the show since its start and could n't wait to order this season as soon as it was available .
another very good movie . all 3 stars do an excellent job of acting and the story line is both interesting and entertaining . i would definitely recommend this video for a rental .
i had seen the original movie before and knew i like it , and while the sequel was ok , i would have been just as well off to just buy the original .
must be a good movie for me to try for the whole series , right ? i only buy movies i know are great !
it is a pretty good movie . most kids will enjoy it ; it is very colorful and creative . buy it now !
not as good as i thought it would be , but i was still laughing out loud for sure ! love it .
season 3 is everything i expected it to be . it was exciting , humorous , witty and made me cry . i ca n't wait for season 4
this is a nice series . it 's well worth it , compared to what 's on tv today . i still wonder if the series continues . quite entertaining
this is a very good tv series it has every thing that you want in a movie excellent special effects good actors the bluray is great .
could not truly understand what they were saying . not well laid out and very little commentary . there were too many cuts !
got ta love this old classic . just wanted to replace my old tape version . always leaves me with a smile ... very enjoyable
i usually love the resident evil series but this is time i will never get back after having watched this movie . now i can say i see why they should stop making movies after 3 .
good plot but i felt rushed through the movie was this a zombie , action family what kind of movie was this ? not really good
complicated plot , took a long time to figure it out . tom cruise did a good acting job along with the other cast .
i do n't really know what exactly i liked about this movie but , it kept my attention . kind of strange , about the dead father , though ...
i am a sucker for these british cop series and this is another good one . the main character seems to struggle with relationships and life but pull it together in time to solve the crimes .
i bought this season for my teenage son . he has enjoyed it as much as i did when i was a child
i enjoy these kind of movies . simple , entertaining , clean , good acting . a good family show which i would highly recommend .
this is a movie we enjoy . it arrived quickly after being ordered and was in good shape . we were pleased with the purchase .
very quick delivery on all products ! dvds in perfect condition ! ! i am definitely a huge fan now ! ! great series that we enjoyed ! we ordered every season that is available ! !
made this movie even more sentimental ! i got it for my step dad because he has all the fast and furious movies . it was really good . lots of twists and turns !
this is great to watch and geared toward adults in the language . buy it now . this would make a great beer drinking game .
my mom loves this movie so i got it for her for mothers day . she totally loved it . thanks for helping make it a special day .
i hate this show . it has some funny parts in it but overall , it 's stupid .
if you grew up anywhere in the & # 34 ; woods & # 34 ; this story will find a place in your heart . jodie foster is at her best .
this was a delight to watch ! i enjoyed this with several of my friends ! we laughed and cried and it got us to talk about our early days of mother hood ! chick flick for sure !
what 's not to like ? marilyn , looking great , a funny story and great acting from all involved . if you 're only going to own one marilyn movie , this is the one to have .
one of the all-time great tv series , it 's too bad that this season ended up being the last one of them .
we did not like this movie . too much violence and full of zombie junk ! prefer movies of real live things not fantasy horror .
this is a good movie . hope all players will watch this movie and learn that there are girls out there who wont let you mess with them ... . lol
i bought every installment of this franchise it is great family fun . we enjoy watching them over and over again .
this movie was so cool . the whole family enjoyed it . i would recomend everyone to get this movie . it was also funny .

my children and i watch it every halloween ! a family holiday tradition ~ sit back and enjoy some of tim burton 's classic animation ... no one does it quite like mr. burton !
its very well done very interesting . i was not at all familiar with the different aspects of the ocean and this brought that world to life .
i did n't like it very much , because there is a lot of violence and it has a sad ending and i do n't like sad endings .
there is really no reason why i purchased these movies , but the movies are fun to watch the trouble everyone gets into .
the acting was superb , but that was the only reason i gave this two stars . this was a boring , disjointed , dark movie . it really had no point and was hard to follow .
entertaining , pleasant , feel good movie . i love anything cary grant and this was an excellent romance movie . i highly recommend this movie . a+
this has long been one of my favorite movies and i have wanted to replace my vhs version for quite some time and i finally did it . it is even better on blu-ray .
finally i have the whole series and it 's a hoot . always liked seinfeld .
back to the future is seriously the best movie of all time . the other two are just as worthy , but part 1 is amazing ... ! ! ! !
it should have been a great flick if i 'd received all of it ! i only got part 2 thanks for nothing !
alfred hitchcock movies are timeless and the stars in these are what make them classics ... i like hitchcock and i have not been disappointed at all

grimm is quite different it is a fairy tale for grown ups . very imaginative ! ! you never know what character is going to pop out each week .
saw this on t.v . and being a big bruce lee fan and growing up during the 70 's , i had to buy it for my collection ! !
i can always count on the sellers on amazon to have exactly what i need . i bought this movie for a cousin , who had been wanting it for some time .
one of the few movies that you can watch over and over again without it ever getting played out . throughly entertaining from beginning to end .
clean and fun sci-fi . not as dark and mature as stargate universe . most of this felt like a clear good vs evil . excellent effects budget and decent acting for a tv sci-fi .
i got this for my parents to watch and they watch it a lot . they love to spend a day just watching different movies .
this was a very entertaining story for adults as well as children . i was surprised at how much i enjoyed it . main character has a cute attitude . great 3d movie .
this was my favorite movie when i was a kid and now , decades later its my kids favorite movie also .

i really loved this big time rush season 1 volume 2 dvd set . the episodes are awesome . the bonus features are wonderful . i would recommend this dvd set to anyone .
well , it has not been released yet and i can not say anything about the quality of blu-ray yet , but the show itself is 5 stars . it is well worth watching .
i am not a fan of this movie in the least bit . it was horrible and i am sad i wasted money and time watching it
the 5 star is for the content and the speed in which it was delivered . recommend for any and all who love police drama .

i found all the characters in this story to be really entertaining . glenn close - what can i say but - wonderful .
for an 80 's flick , it has held up well . thoroughly enjoyed the extras and movie again . good enough to watch over and over again .
this is type of movie that keeps you interested . it has the suspense , action , and more . i would recommend this movie to those who enjoy a really good action movie .
wow what a wonderful movie it was very well played and made me feel good for start to finish wow
this would not play on my blu-ray player but works fine on dvd so make sure you have a dvd player before ordering this .
this about a young boy who write to our soldier over sea and the soldier fall in love with his mom which is a great story to watch with the family and friends
one more great performance for pierce brosnan . pierce is at his best when he plays complicated characters . well worth an addition to your movie collection .
i love this movie . i share it with my students every year . it arrived just in time for my unit .
though this show has been around for a long time , it is worth watching again . not all of it is spectacular , but perry makes up for the sometimes corny plot lines .
cute for younger kids . my grand daughter is 3 1/2 and she sat and watched all of it . cute family video .
this is a great movie for adults as well as kids , i 've watched it now several times and enjoyed every time . : o )
even though this movie is based on a book , i think that the actresses do a wonderful job of creating a story worth watching .
out for justice is one of steven seagal 's best movie . it looked even better on blue ray . the fight scenes were epic . steven seagal was amazing in this movie .
too much cussing but paul is totally cool and it keeps me constantly laughing , while being a warm movie too .
orginal bought for her but end up kept for myself ... good movie . i like it ... amazing movie . she enjoyed it as well .
had mixed emotions at the end it just let you hanging without a resolution to say the least . maybe i missed it . like the movie plot but it needed a better ending for the hero .
first of all this movie should be on dvd . i loved this movie and if you have not seen it , you should ! ! ! ! !
jack frost was wonderful . the santa need some work . but over all it was a good movie . thank you for your time .

great fun movie and sean connery , what could be better . donald sutherland is great also . great product and service . love it .
i do not know what it is about that cold little island that makes such interesting people . a real fun comedy !

ever part of the move is good . if you can get past the subtitles you will love it.. definately worth buying
this is a beautiful movie . just try to not cry at the ending - i doubt you 'll be able to stop the tears . this is pixar at its best ! !
it held my 2 year old 's attention for about 15 minutes and that was the end of it . so i turned it off , .
this movie was mediocre at best . very dull at certain points . three stars and no more . you be the judge
my kids were so excited . it is too repetitive . however , i like having a classic entertainment around . my youngest watched one disc with me .
i enjoyed the all 3 of the spider man movies and this one is a good one to get if you like the 2nd one .
i cried so hard at the end . i just loved this movie . dustin hoffman rules .
a must see movie . you will rarely stop laughing . the characters are great . really a classic movie . safe for kids to watch !
i loved her show and am happy to have added this set to my library . i have another set of her show .
this volume has all of the greatness of the first volume but taken to another level . the acting is superb and the action is top notch . these two movies should be part of any film fans collection .
i was very impressed when i saw these shows on the discovery channel . i have been absolutely amazed to see them in hd . i recommend this to anyone who enjoyed these shows . awesome !
this is the funniest movie i have ever seen . i ordered it because of my mother ... ..i have never seen her laugh so hard at any movie .
missed seeing it , and finally saw it and have no regrets . i am glad i finished the series . loved them all .
whatever the hype against this movie is all about ... it was fantastic . nicole kidman and john cusack deliver stellar performances . watch it .
i enjoy watching late at night when there is nothing else on tv to watch . i just would like them to bring out new dvd series sooner . great series .
get it ! ... blu-ray lives up to it name and standard and if you really like this film you 'll appreciate even more , worth the purchase ! !
i enjoy this blu-ray . it was delivered as advertised and is a good value for the money . i am glad i purchased it .
i followed twilight and the build up to this move was great but after i watched this movie it was kinda a let down . it just was n't as good as the others .
this was is a classic movie my daughter was surprised to get this dvd . she wanted it for some time now she own this movie .
would watch again , very good and scary movie . would recommend to all my friends , do n't watch in the dark alone .
this classic movie is a favorite of mine . replacing old vhs movies for dvd format . waiting to see new version .
good for a classic movie , but not great like some of the other vincent price classics . you will enjoy it , but not be dying to see it again .
this was a really great feel good movie , i have watched it several times . i found out the two actors are actually married in real like and that made it even better .
i really loved this movie have not seen it since i was a kid i really enjoyed seeing it again
amazing twisted series . have n't enjoyed a series like this in years . very addictive so beware , you will want to know the ending .

great detective stories -- use captions if you have a problem with the brit accent .
was a very good movie . would watch it again . bought it for my son that loves these types of movies .
i seen this movie on tv but in only in small bits and not the whole movie . i am so glad that i bought the movie . it was very good .
most of the original crew of `` are you being served '' so if you are a fan this is ok. they are a lot older and out of the store .
this was a very good and entertaining movie . my wife and i enjoyed it since it was a family friendly film . it was a good story with an interesting plot twist at the end .
i liked it even though it was not exactly what i had been waiting for all these years . i will enjoy it for years to come .
true to the times with the costumes and cultures this movie is an amazing example of how things were and how they changed . beautifully written and acted .
i do not like being required to write a specific number of words to tell some one i got what i wanted
it was completely predictable and extremely slow moving . i was surprised that these 2 great stars were in this movie .
we have been watching this show since it began and it was fun to begin the series over again . if you want a truly great tv escape with interesting characters ... check this show out ! ! !
great j. stewart western , one of his best . kind of `` dark '' , but still great movie .
this is for men , not for women . i walked out of the room and my husband stayed until the end .
i enjoyed this movie as it reflects my generation during the 1960 's vietnam era where a bunch of guys go through military training and are sent to vietnam . i can truly identify .
every dad should watch this movie ! it has some great insight and messages ! they did a good job and with each movie they get better and better .
while not exactly true to history , i very much enjoyed the film . i first saw the film in the late 1950 's . thank you for making it available .
you get what you get when you sign on for a chick flick , they did a good job . it was a cute movie .
a very unexpected purchase . was not for sure how i would like this but it was a excellent sit on the edge of your seat
one of the best comedy shows of all time . wish they 'd do an updated version .
just love glee wish there were more show like that i do n't think there been a bad show the whole time its been on the air
awesome the acting was really good and the story man it had some issues , but this does happen in real life . loved it ! !
i love movies ! this one is so cute . i love katherine heigl , she is a pleasure to watch . plus , many other good actors to enjoy .
very enjoyable . had not seen this one before and was n't sure what to expect . it was very good and i would watch again .
i wanted the extra behind the scenes and the commentary the comes along with the blu-ray . if you are buying this movie then you most likely already know what to expect and it worked great .
thanks and god bless for providing this much appreciated product for our family . thank you thank you thank you
anyone who has a child ( girl or boy ) should watch this documentary with them ! never say it could n't happen to you .
fantastic series for my christmas movie collection . action , drama and comedy that children and adults can watch together . famous actors and entertaining plot line .
love these movies . bought the trilogy and am looking forward to sharing them with others . can not say enough good stuff about it .
this movie is so interesting . the little girl that is the star of this movie is a wonderful actress . the movie has so many interesting parts .
this is a fun movie that you can watch time and again . great performances by everyone . the story is fun and funny .
we love this movie , than again we have enjoyed the series . johnny deep is a great actor and does n't disappoint in this movie for us . great to have on the go .
excellent tv series for people who enjoy mysteries , alfred hitchcock or sherlock holmes . always twists and turns towards a surprise ending .
if you can get past an aging mel gibson playing a young man , you will probably like this film as much as most people have .
for a nicolas cage movie i was not that impressed it was not a good roll for him but it was also an older film so i guess you have to start some where .
two great actors come together for a exciting and funny movie with all the action one needs . do n't miss it .
such a sweet movie with a great twist at the end that i never saw coming . i love romantic suspense stories .
good film , good acting and a good story line . it will keep your attention from beginning to end . mark wahlberg makes the movie work , he plays this role well and is very believable .
one word says it all . horrible ! i 'm shocked that john goodman would lower himself to be in this film . times must be tough .
i was very surprised how good this version is . glad to add it to my collection . we have 3 versions and watch one each night christmas eve eve to christmas eve to christmas night . great !
this is a cute story and everyone in our family enjoyed it . we parents did and so did our 21 month old and our 8 year old . we had lots of laughs !
this is a fun and funny tv show . the six friends on this show are like & # 34 ; friends , & # 34 ; but they are british , and very , very funny .
this show is too funny and just a good straight out funny comedy show to watch . well worth the money .
running out of things to say . have always loved shows that require a brain to get the job done . excellent .
i did n't understand this movie , and i will give it another shot , but i 'd watch patrick swayze read the phone book for 2 hours . he 's another gifted actor gone too soon .
he is a very talented young man . a very good comedian . very much worth the money to purchase the dvd
it 's really sweet simple and cute . my 2 year old loves it and we can stand it too . i have seen it 5 times now . it was worth the price .
we love all these movies and unfortunately i had to return it because i did not realize they were already in our dvd library .
that is all i can say . after that the blood and gore became a little too much to handle . i know it is a true story , but really .
this series has a good cast and reasonable writing , good entertainment and easy to like characters , a better than average sitcom .
i love everything about like band of brothers , the pacific tell you about the war with japan once more time how was the war
love the movie . dvd was good quality . if you like clint eastwood then i would recommend this movie to you .
love this movie . i watch it quite a bit . never gets old . i 'm an old sci fi movie fan and the thing , them , and war of the worlds are my favorites .
funny and dramatic i enjoy the back and forth between the leads . nice female lead series . not a boring show .
i like kevin costner and have been collecting his movies for some time , , , kind of expensive to cross over from vhs to dvd but they last longer ...
ok. i did like the movie more so for the action sequences than anything else . i never thought harrison ford would play a part in a movie like this . i did enjoy it though .
was n't as bad as i thought it would be . figured out the plot by mid movie . if you are a arnold or sly fan then give it a view .
there is n't much i can say here . the movie was great on the big screen and is great still on my 60 & # 34 ; tv .
it was a good movie , but not quite what i was expecting . good cast and the acting was not bad . would recommend but read up more about what it is about
it arrived very quickly . i have not had the time to view it yet but i am hoping that is it in good condition .
i love this movie very funny i think the 1st one was the best i hope people order this movie
we are fans of matlock - the closed captions are new ( i think ) and are helpful .
fast service . excellent condition . i like old movies and the old stars that play in them . thank you .
the movie is timeless and fun . it would have been great to have a commentary track and some other extras .
this movie is amazing . blu ray makes all the difference though . you should see the difference and judge for yourself
i saw this movie years ago and loved it . i still love it and enjoy all the actors in it . i recommend this to everyone .
love most things bbc . sherlock is great . a bit dark at times but entertaining none the less . ca n't wait to see season 4
i was surprised by the storyline . was n't what i was expecting from the dark knight . good actors as usual . i think it 's worth buying a copy and watching again .
this season was consistent with the high quality i grew to expect from the production crew of this show . we need shows like this today .
this is a much better version of the classic movie . it is more realistic and the story is better told with this added material .
once again , channing tatum is the bomb . he is one great actor as well as the other actors in this action pack adventure . i would recommend it to anyone who likes action movies .
brad pitt is one of our favorite actors . he is just great in this movie . what a thriller right up to the end . it will have you on the edge of your seat ...
has to be one of the top 100 of all time . this blu-ray is perfect ! ! !
saw this film recently while taking time out to relax and simply view films missed in the late evening . this film `` caught '' my attention for the acting `` and '' clever plot !
i want to have the entire collection for my library so i can enjoy watching these great characters over and over again . these 2 completed made my collection complete .
this movie was made after the series firefly aired . the dvd was in perfect condition - just as described by the seller . it arrived very quickly . i would definitely buy from this seller in the future .
this movie is an instant classic ! its hillarious and fun ! my kids love it and it is one of the movies that i dont mind if it 's watched over and over .
the movie was cute . i enjoyed to see a movie where someone works hard to get what they wanted . i absolutely loved the movie
i liked this movie but actually purchased the dvd for my grandson who wanted it . but you just ca n't beat bob hope and bing cosby as a comedy team .
story was ok , graphics , special effects were good but not great . as i said worth a rent and not a buy .
good plot , good acting . dennis quaid delivers his usual good performance and the story is edge of your chair action .
just love these movies they meet some real cool character ` s and make me laugh i have all of the movies
this was good but the story line in the first was better . kinda glad i rented it instead of buying it
a very good movie . keeps you on the edge of your seat . recommend this movie to anyone who likes ancient history .
fun , entertaining , and pretty good . i enjoyed it . like adding it to my library . like i needed another dvd . oh well . worth watching
i read the book a few times and hoped that the movie would be just a good . i absolutely loved it and will enjoy watching it many times on blu ray .
denzel and mark have good chemistry as actors and seem to work together well . a touch of humor between the characters and lots of action makes for an enjoyable movie .
the books were wonderful and the movie does not disappoint . my husband had not read the books , and he really liked the movie . it made him want to read the books .
i thought the first season was excellent and this second season continues in excellence . very entertaining and the characters are quite engaging . i highly recommend it .
i like that this series grabs you right from the beginning . when an episode ends i ca n't stop . i keep moving onto the next one .
it was a very action packed season with both good ( happy ) points and bad ( sad ) points . you wont want to miss it !
i love this series and have watched it from the beginning i would recommend this to anyone who loves csi miami the storylines are great
i was so very glad to get this movie , i had never seen it but heard about it ... thanks for a great movie and a great price ... i love amazon ... ..
i 'm pretty sure i saw this on tv , but did n't know the title , it 's an interesting premise , but lacks the climax .
perfect series , great condition . like many i adore this series , books and movies . worth every penny , i ca n't wait until they release extended versions .
heard about this movie for years before i got to see it , still love it today , it 's a guy thing .
if you are looking for a action packed movie , than this is the movie to get . i thought that the women in this movie was hot .
i consider this one of the best biblical movies i have seen to date . it will be hard to beat this one !

this was a great season for this show . i am so glad i purchased this set . ca n't wait for season three !
saw this movie on the hallmark channel . really liked this movie a lot and decided to purchase it . a movie the whole family could watch .
this movie surprised me . i thought it was just a love story but it is very interesting and has a mysterious plot and is not boring at all ! !
it so bad i could n't watch the whole movie the acting , the script , it not well develop it one of those movies if you have nothing better to do really pass
i really enjoyed it . the plot did n't have many surprises but with great acting , it became a great movie .
it was an unusual movie that attempts to keep the watcher confused and is successful at that throughout the movie . a movie to see once , but not twice
this is one of the best movies made . great stars and great action . must buy for all .
loved this movie when it came on tv . so nice to be able to buy it . it is a very sweet movie .
i guess i just do n't understand such a film short . it 's over before it even gets started . it was just okay for me .
once again errol flynn at his best and the musical score is excellent . another collectors piece .
a must have . a very inspiring movie that makes you think and view life . will bring tears to your eyes and for me the characters reminded me my friends . great ! ! ! !

she made some good choices in her youth , but bad ones as she aged - just the opposite of most people , which is what i found to be so interesting . good packaging , reasonable shipping .
this dvd set arrived quickly and was packaged well . i introduced my family to this series , and they were very excited to receive the second season .
a fun movie with great soundtrack . the actors were perfect for their roles ; the actresses were n't as appealing , but it was a fun few hours .

perfect addition to my collection . fast shipping , have purchased several films with this vendor . i am thrilled to be catching up on all of johnny 's work .
great classic fun . i love to watch these again and remember how ground breaking they were when they first aired .
this is one sorry movie . with all the hype you would think it would at least have a story line . no good .
no , really ? do i need to review this ? if you know it - its everything you know , if you dont - well its about time you watch it ! : )
the show was fun , exciting , real , and full of amazing storyline . my only regret is that there is no more story being produced .
it had a few funny moments , but overall not that good . i would not watch it again . the plus side of renting is i do n't have to look at it anymore .
it was sad to see such a good series end - but at least we can watch it on reruns ! ! !
also another great movie from the past and i had this to my collection . movies back then were movies and so enjoyable .
this is a great date night movie . it is funny , charming and romantic . adam sandler & drew barrymore at their best !
received quickly ; sadly i have not had time to watch the dvds ... great series as i remember them ... . more words added cause i have to ...
david jason is frost . have all the series . all good . have been a fan of jason for years .
i was pleasantly surprised by this movie . it is an intense action romp and i highly recommend it for all fans of the zombie genre .
he was good in this movie . i liked the action and interaction between the characters . worth watching if you like action shows with some comedy mixed in .
we are segal fans , so found that the humor was put on . but , that is stallone . alot of action in the end , worth waiting for .
this is what i expected . decent quality , ok case , good youth memories , great add on movie to my movie collection .
the film had some good special effects and action scenes . a typical super hero vs. villain . iron man has some good humor scenes as well .
there is plenty of action in this one . interesting plot with twists and turns that were unexpected . a good action flick .
good movie ! just not a lot of depth about the man ! it tells the story about what happened to the man , but not much about the man himself .
birthday gift for my husband who is learning to play guitar . he loves it and says it is very helpful
it is the x-men 2 movie , i love it some prefer more along the comics . i like wolverine played by jackman , have all the movies now .
this is a little slow to get to the action compared to what i remember and today 's standards . my 17 year old daughter kept falling asleep and never did get to the exciting parts .
before i knew it , the movie was over . it went by so fast . keeps you stuck to the screen . ca n't wait for the next one
emotions so strong that you dont know to cry of cheer , so you end up doing both at the same time . what an incredibly powerful feeling to have .
fun kid movie . great to have on our amazon prime account . pixar makes great animation with great stories . one of my kids favorites .
i have been enjoying the marvel heroes and catching up with those in the avengers . it was also nice to have this on prime as the second one is due out soon .
denzel washington is a good actor ... .i watch every movie he 's in ... ..i just had to get this for my player
ride along ( blu-ray + dvd + digital hd with ultraviolet ) is a great and funny movie to have in your movie collection .

i purchased all three dvds and i love them . the moves are different and let me know tell you , you will definitely feel it . money well spent .
i actually owned this movie years ago . i love the indian culture and the film is romantic , sexy in a nice way and beautifully filmed . enjoyed it .
an excellent review , though the god issue should have been left out as it has nothing to do with life .
do not usually like this kind of a movie , but hugh laurie made it all worth while .
the first movie to put a comedy team together with universal 's monsters . the funniest movie of this genre hands down .
the best modern american writer of fiction was robert parker his tone , dialog and detail is flawless . in stone cold tom selleck does an amazing job and the cast is first class .
wonderful show . i ca n't get enough of it . so glad there are 4 seasons of this show and they are on prime . i 'll be sad to finish the series .
very fun movie just goes to show you that when it is not your child it is that much harder
i can relate a lot to this move , thats why i had to have it . i would definitely recommend it to others .
if you like house , then this series will be no exception . if nothing else , he keeps us entertained even in his worst moments .
shows how the programs got started and can learn a lot about how they risk their life to save people .
if you like baseball , you will love this history of the game . the 30 's thru the 70 's were the most interesting to me .

ever since the james bond flicks went to blu-ray , this is the one i wanted to get . one of the great bond flicks .
this show is wonderful ... ... drama , action and a story that really makes you ask questions . perfect ! !
this movie was full of action and suspence . had a great time watching it . was a bit better than expected because it had some interesting twists to the plot .
some of the episodes of season 2 were good , others were not . some of the episodes left me disappointed at the end . i sort of liked it , but not as much as season 1 .
i was pretty upset with the dvd version of this film . but the blu-ray really comes through . the picture is great and so is the sound .
there is always something special about the blu-ray form that makes the movie even better .
i recommend this series for every age . great life lessons and wonderful views . i miss this kind of tv show and i they had more today .
this is my favorite out of the two . wish there was more sequels . one of those movies that i can watch over and over again .
absolutely adorable . the entire family gets a kick out of this movie . i especially love the clothes ... it 's a hoot !
this movie is just great . if you love a good underdog story with some bits of humor mixed in you 'll love this . apparently it 's very accurate to real life events .
this is one of my all time favorite movies . tom cruise and brad pitt are at their best in this one .
good , but very , very creepy . sorry i watched it ; not really a fan of creepy movies . definitely a different type of role for kevin costner .
i thought there was a lot of improvement over the original , but the original is still very powerful . so if you liked the original , then you should like this .
terrific movie . i like this actor and unique movies . it is amazing what people think up to get children 's attention . i would recommend this movie to anyone .
showed up fast and in excellent condition ! very pleased ! well worth the order ! thanks for such good service !
very entertaining and fast moving . i enjoyed it a lot . i am a super hero and syfy nut and it was right down my alley .
almost the last one to complete the series in my collection - being a sci-fi fanatic - i love this one
it was ok to watch , but the story line was thin . the special effects were good . had to be the same team from the first one .
received in a very timely manner and in great condition . i would definitely order from this vendor again !
anyone that loves toby keith will love this , all his best video clips are on this and he is at his best
kind of a confusing movie . my husband liked it more than me . i would have preferred to rent this from the red box instead .
the story & plot of this movie kept you drawn to it it is not to action packed or fast paced though
bought for my special needs daughter . she loves dogs and this is one of her favorite movies . a good movie .
of course the little guy that got this for christmas loved it . probably still watching it . sorry for the late thank you

everyone has seen this movie before ... but in 3d it 's like watching it for the first time amazing depth . .. do n't know how they did it but wow
not as good as volume i. the stories were more interesting and scary in volume i than ii . acting was not as good in this either .

loved it ! i saw the broadway show and i just had to see what it was based on and i am glad i did .
this was a pretty good movie . de niro was very good . except for the airplane i thought the travel scenes dragged out too long .
overall a good movie . would loved to have more action scenes , but otherwise a good movie , personally i like the first one a little better due to the comedy that came with it .

how can you not enjoy this movie and now that they finally put it on dvd makes it even better great movie to watch ... .
if you are a vincent price fan , this is a must for your collection . i love most of 50s horror and sci-fi and this movie ranks . it 's entertaining with great acting .
why would anyone think this guy is funny ? he is funny looking , but still ca n't tell a joke to ... 20 .
the christmas special added characters and events featured in season 3 and was enjoyable to watch . recommended for any viewers who missed it when originally shown .
here is a character that can have a few more stories written ... even though , so far it is a similar story line ... it had to start somewhere !
this movie follows the book very closely . it really makes you feel this characters hunger not only for food , but for freedom of the human spirit and mind .
such a good show . i remember watching these back in the 90s . tv is n't like that anymore . it 's wonderful that i was able to find these shows on amazon .
this movie was very predictable and the acting was only so-so . the subject matter was good but i would not highly recommend it . it could have been much better .
fun movie to waste a rainy afternoon . this is the best one of the rush hour series . chris tucker keeps you laughing .
jag was such a great program and was sad to see it go but glad i am able to get the second season . have the first as well .
one of our favorite series ever . not only good acting but good stories . looking forward to the next season already .
i have not watched the movie yet have heard good reviews on it so i will try and watch it this weekend
this is the best sitcom ever . i love every minute of big band theory . its humor unlike any humor on tv right now
i do n't think there 's really a reason to rate the movies ( you either like them or you do n't ) , but as far as the purchase goes , i feel it was a great deal .
such fake you have never seen and no action worth watching . do n't waste your money one this one . the acting it even good . short and very bad .
classic black and white tv with perfect picture quality and excellent sound , better than when it originally was on air .
great movie . great effects . do n't listen to the negative comments . this was great sci-fi . extras were ok but since i do n't watch them they did n't matter . lol
great movie . i have 3d and love all the 3d movies any way . this was a fun ride . but nothing like number 1 mib
great movie for whole family including adult humor . 2nd time watching and saw things that we missed the first time looking forward to sequel
i was happy to be able to get the entire series as it is packaged . the price was good and it arrived promptly after i ordered it .

this is one of my favorite movies ever . it is so funny and well done . i have watched it lots .
was a great movie and we have added this to our collection . i recommend this to others , and it received a five star because the packaging , movie and quality was excellent .
kick ass ! ! ! better than the first season , better locations for survival ... . i like this season because it is never boring
with smith , channing , and sutherland how could it be bad ? great story line , if you have never seen it you are missing out on great entertainment !
so fun , fast moving , lots of laughs , not sure what will happen next , and the ending just fine and spectacular
it was good but not a great movie . i enjoyed the message . it was a colorful movie . the acting was good as well but not great .
this was a great cast with a good mix of smart dialogue and action . a few plot twists kept it interesting through the end .
this movie was okay , not one of the best western i 've saw . but still okay . if you like westerns then you 'll like this movie .
this movie is a classic ! everyone needs to see it . and yes , it is definitely better than the johnny depp remake ...
it was great seeing these retro cartoons . i wish that they still made them like this . i give it 5 stars easily !
i purchased this movie to replace a vhs copy i had in my collection ... it is just an & # 34 ; ok & # 34 ; movie in my opinion ...
i do n't buy any movie unless it was worth it and great flick and a good price and it works well all in all great buy
good british mystery . not the one i thought it would be but i was n't disappointed at all .
i was very surprised with the story line , i thought it would be better than it was . it did n't keep my interest .
there have been other movie 's about this but not on this scale , well worth watch history . a little more true history could have been used , but well worth the money .
one star better than sylvester stallone and the expendables , i 'll say that . but , it 's close . seriously , just do n't watch this movie .
loved this movie when i was growing up and i just had to own it and amazon had it for a great deal .
i can not wait until the next season to come out . i watched them all so far and the last season leaves you wanting more .
if you havent gotten on board yet you need too . this is one great show . based on a comic book . the characters are great and the show has always had a good feel .
i very much enjoyed this excellent version of emma . the actors , the setting and the music were outstanding .
this movie has giant monsters fighting giant robots . if you 're not into cool things like that , you wo n't like this . otherwise , this movie is super fun .
if you are a star trek original series fan , there is no better way to enjoy it than on blu-ray .
i have this one at home on dvd , but was in need of entertainment and as i love this flick , i had to rent it .
a must have dvd for movie viewers and collectors . i purchased this movie for two family members and they were very happy to get this one .
i gave a review about this excellent purchase many weeks ago - what 's up ? i repeat - excellent dvd , quick service .
sidney poitier never disappoints ! this was a very enjoyable performance and well acted by everyone . it is always fun to see the underdog come out on top !
i 'd highly recommend this movie . the writers did a great job and kept to the original graphic novel . if your a fan of the comic book , you will enjoy this movie .
i just love old classics . these are the movies of all movies . just love old classics . i love the actors and actresses back then .
this movie is really good . you do n't have to like meryl streep to watch this . alec baldwin is terrific and the movie is very well made .
collecting entire series from season 1 on . this purchase was excellent . i would definitely recommend this to anyone . love this show .
i am so happy that i have fantasy island i have the first season now i have this i always like fantasy island .
i enjoy this movie . i watch it all the time . i like the actors and the music is great ! nice !
i had high hopes . it took a good while before we laughed , and the laughter never lasted too long . predictable and mildly entertaining is about as good as it gets .
once more another one that is not uncut but it is edited even though it makes up for it with extra scenes then the tv broadcast it would have been better uncut .
i bought this for a friend who grew up with this film . he said its a really good movie . that 's all i 've got for this review .
while i 'm a huge fan of sean connery bond movies this ranks right up there . lots of drama with classic bond humor as well
what can you say about madea ... another great hit for tyler . it always turns out madea 's way . great cast !
ok who here ca n't love the old top gun , awesome . . . . . . . . . . .
we have not viewed this item , yet . we watch lonesome dove and loved it . it came before it was due .
this is a great performance by bill cosby . there are only a few rare words of profanity . i have enjoyed this performance for years . i highly recommend this hilarious show to everyone .
this is a movie that is a favorite for my daughter and my grandson . this is a way for them to share and connect .

was so happy that this item is now available on dvd . what a great show . i especially enjoyed the commentary provided on the disc .
the continuing story lines , and acting in this series is great . does n't seem so & # 34 ; put on & # 34 ; as a lot of cop shows on tv in recent years
i loved it when i was a kid and still do as an adult . always funny and a joy to watch .
this is an awesome movie , i would like to thank the seller for a speedy delivery and the dvd is in great shape and thank you amazon for bringing this product as well as many others to the public
we enjoyed watching the show when it aired on television so we were excited to find out we could buy the dvds . we really enjoyed watching and keep watching the series .
my two adult daughters asked me to buy this for them for christmas . they love this performance better than the movie and have watched it several times already .
we are currently living in st. thomas and know one of the & # 34 ; extras & # 34 ; in the film so wanted to watch and see familiar faces and places !
a must have addition to those great classic movies for the whole family you will enjoy for generations to come !
we purchased this a few months ago for our young kids and have enjoyed every episode . definitely a keeper in our house .
this show was one of my favorite all time shows . i really enjoyed every episode . and i highly recommend them to anyone .
classic walken . my wife and i both enjoyed this movie ... more than i thought i would . it is worth the rental .
i love this show . the characters are so well developed . i love the twists and turns of this show it is like real life .
this is an amazing movie . i had watched previously , but i could n't resist watch it again . beautiful , well-made , great performance , for me is perfect .
interesting series the actors are intense and involved in their characters , directing and development not as serious as the actors
i like a movie with a great storyline , that also has such good actors to bring it to life . this one is that kind of movie .
these two movies together is a great idea . i love both of these movies & all the stars . get these movies if you do n't already have them .
very good . a bit long towards the end . i liked the other hannibal movies more . very interesting look at his childhood .
we were looking for the new version of this movie and ran across this one . it 's a well produced movie without the singing , pretty good .
the fast and the furious was better , but this was the best of the sequels .
i love this show . it brings back so many good memories for me . thank you
i watched the movie with my daughters an i liked it because we visited ford theatre last year in dc . my daughters are talking about the civil war in school .
great movie ! loved the dogs and story line . received the movie in just a few day . anyone who loves dogs will love this movie
these are two nice old john wayne movies . they definitely are way better than his old `` b '' movie days . they are very enjoyable movies , and definitely worth seeing !
this movie , since i was 14 , has been in my top 10 favorite movies of all time . i love this movie and watch it whenever im sad . & # 60 ; 3
the movie was enjoyable , but the characters to me were emotionally rather flat as portrayed by the actors . not as exciting as i expected , but it was still entertaining .
well , i want to keep on , my wife and i watch it together . she has me hooked , i guess . enjoy .
i love the lord of the rings trilogy , this first movie was a bit of a disappointment . i did n't feel they developed the characters well enough .
we love old movies and of course the hepburn movies are wonderful . having four of them in one order is wonderful .
a musical with excellent actors a great story a classic all people world wide would love this dvd classic ! ! !
wow not what i thought it was going to be . bad watch not worth your time or money do n't bother
christopher lee a great actor as a vampire known as dracula . all 8 films he did are great .
based on earlier reviews i watched the movie but for some reason it bored me . maybe its the kind of film that needs an audience .
the movie is a classic , and the box set is beautiful . a must own for fans ...
another great dvd by the celtic thunder . truly a fun group to see and know you would have a great time singing along .
my toddler had zero interest in this it very fast paced there was no way i could do this with her and was not even relaxing to me
this is a great movie to watch and have fun with the actors and watch when ever you want to watch
put a big smile on my grandaughter face , arrived in condition as stated , i was very pleased .
was funny put a smile on my face but the acting was terrible . i like the actors just not a good storyline .
great first season i like this show i would not get it on dvd if i did not like it .
so glad we went with this series . for a show that is 20 years old , this rocks . thanks for offering .
always enjoyed gregory peck . i enjoy flying movies about ww ii . great movie . always wanted to own this movie and now i do .
a very exciting non-stop action film with wonderful acting . a real world thrill that is very entertaining . i highly recommend it .
this takes the most interesting topics for many babies and combines them ! it 's nothing short of fabulous ! it has a baby section , a dog section and a farm section .
as stated before , good acting and story line . this is right up there with downton abby . wish there was more !
this was an ok movie . i do n't regret having watched it , but am not sure i could sit through it again .
i am a superman fan to my core . so i definitely had to have this movie and it did not disappoint .
my husband teenage sons love this son . i 've tried watching and could n't last more than a few minutes . to each his own .
for some reason i never owned a tape version , but i am glad to own a dvd , just as much fun as i remembered it to be .
this movie was surprisingly very good . i was n't expecting it to be good because i never heard much about it but it was emotional and the story line was very good .
there is quick humor here and i have quickly felt like a friend . great show and i will continue to watch !
the only escape here is the end of the movie . stupid story , cheesy music and no entertainment value at all . definitely skip it .
a very heart touching love story . the movie takes place at a newer time where the book takes place at an older time .
i really enjoyed every movie in this set . it 's a great selection of film noir and definitely has a little something for everyone .
dick van dyke is one of my favorite shows of all time ! i could watch it every night , literally forever .
so bad it was funny rather than scary . maybe its because i watched a 30 year old movie . i guess it was scary when it came out .
i love holiday movies , and this one is very sweet ! a little different than the original , but still a great movie with a different twist .
old classic movie i watched when i was younger so thought my girls would like it . funny cute at the same time
got this for $ 18 and for blu ray cant pass it up for that price , quality really good , hey its blu ray
i loved it . it was informative as well as entertaining . i gave one as a gift . i would recommend this to everyone .
i have n't seen this movie in years and i just watched it again and i can definitely say that this movie was still awesome after all this time !
the sequel to the greatest movie of all time ! was so happy to purchase it and was even happier when it came in ! love it !
this is one of the best videos i seen on the study from the bible . i have taught this many times and it was don really good in the movie . it went along with the bible very close
this dvd is great , i love burn notice ... this dvd came in the original case and came before it was due .
i liked this movie very much and was glad to finally see it . i missed it in theatres and now have the complete trilogy .
great classic movie for the whole family super sound and video what a change from the old vhs and the bonus dvd shows how they did it and the cast all grown up a lot of fun
i am very pleased with my purchase . this season of csi ny is another great season . i have to say this is one of my favorite shows .
i watched this movie as a child so i had to add it to my movie collection . it really is a creative story line . you wo n't be disappointed !
she is spectacular in all three movies . i recommend getting a great drink and even popcorn and watching them all back to back .
certainly worth watching but surprised after seeing it that it won the academy award for best picture . obviously really tough subject matter and some scenes are tough to watch .
nice video ... .i really wanted to purchase the dvd and bought this by accident ... .it is nice but i wanted the dvd ... .
what an amazing show it grabs your attention and never lets it go from beginning to end . i will watch it again .
i love this movie . when i first saw it , i just had to buy it for myself .
this movie is just lame . how it won any awards is beyond me .
this is a great video , my wife and i love it . a great addition to our video library . recommend it to everyone .
it has always been one of my favorite movies since i was a kid and i finally bought it excellent movie .
superman was always my favorite superhero since i was five years old . seeing the those films on blu-ray just suprised me big time . and i love it !

this was a very different zombie movie , the zombies think talk and crush on girls . very different , it was cute i would watch it again .
who could not love this version of a christmas carol ? this movie is great and a must see during the holidays .
it was an ok movie but it wasnt as good as i thought it would be ... it came on time and the picture was in good shape
i like the story and the package that it came in . i would buy from seller again .
we like this movie so much we watch it all the time , it 's a nice change from the other one .
the entire movie was based on an individual obsessed with a movie . it was poorly acted and completely ridiculous . im glad that i was a prime member and didnt have to pay for this .
this is the best sitcom ever made ! ! ! laugh and cry . cry and laugh . so sweet , brilliant writing , and pure magic .
i like this show and have the first 2 seasons on dvd . i will also wait to purchase season 3 until it is n't cut .
brings back good memories of quality television programming . now add the six million dollar man to the available shows and we 'll have a perfect match .
i really liked the actor , the story lines . i generally do n't care for the southern good ole boy type plots , but this one really caught my attention . well worth the time .
i just love brad ! he did a very good job on this one . the movie was very entertaining and would recommend it to those who love fiction ... .
this was n't exactly what i thought it was going to be but got more and more into it as it progressed . i hope there is a follow up . recommended .
makes you care about each and every character . after watching a few episodes i was rooting for not only the football team but the people and their relationships .
i just love this series . it is well written and full of action . what is there not to like about this series .
i just loved this season and bought season 2 right away . the actors are great and the story line is exciting . i recommend this series .
this is a great movie . it is good for all ages . we have watched it over and over as a family .
snow white is he first disney movie i have ever watched and snow white is my favorite princess . this box set is awesome !
i bought this for my special needs daughter . she loves it . she works out to this almost everyday . easy for her to follow and keep up .
this movie is a joke . the only reason i did n't laugh was because i kept remembering the money i spent for watching it ... sad ...
air plane scene is the best . m m m m m m m m m m m m m m
i love this series i wish i would have caught it sooner i like the plot and the characters in this series . worth the watch !
i enjoyed this movie for the most part but have enjoyed reading the books more . very action packed and adventurous .
better i think then the first . but you must see the first before to keep up . loved the special effects .
the video was enjoyable when i saw it many years ago but this purchase was a birthday gift . i consider the dvd to be fluff and i purchased it for someone who enjoys lighthearted fluff .
sent this as a gift and the recipient states the product was exactly as advertised . will continue to purchase from you . thanks
very kid friendly movie , for those with kids not yet teens . this was a good family movie for all to enjoy .
loads of laughs and also violence ... i think it goes heavy on violence but lived provided much need know but the kids loved it
i think this movie is overrated . i thought it was ok but it was actually very boring at times . it is just ok for me .
very emotional and interesting especially for a story that has told sooo many times . excellent cast and performances as well !
i watched the hunger games and was pleasantly surprised with the concept of this movie . great acting and plot . excellent .
two superb performances . the dialogue is smooth and easy to get involved with . have n't seen this in years and forgot how much i liked it .
this was a happy ending love story . it was about finding true love in an unexpected time , place , situation , and person .
i liked this movie but my sister did n't . she has no children so those who understand the love of a mother probably relate to the movie better . the love of a mother ... .
i love everything about this dvd . it is exactly as i remember when i watched this as a kid , so good job guys : )
loved this show when it originally came out and now glad to share it with my kids . nice special effects with the dinosaurs and the story is interesting .
a movie that touches the heart . a must see for the entire family . there is a great need for more movies like this . keep them coming .
i found this movie to be fascinating for some reason and cruise fit right into the role . i 've watched it several times since i received it and will watch it again and again .
the first two movies were good but i was disapointed in the third movie .
i enjoyed this even more than the original movies . the casting was fantastic . i think any fan of x-men would love this movie .
you ca n't help singing along and really enjoying all the performances in this movie . after seeing it once , i had to buy it .
wonderful thriller with surprises . i also scream at certain scenes even though i 've seen this film at least 4 times .
two of the very best movies ever made in one package . belongs in every movie lover 's collection because you never know when these titles might not be available on streaming video .
it was n't a great movie , it did n't have the & # 34 ; it 's going to be a classic & # 34 ; feel to it , but it was entertaining .
i was so pleased to watch this movie . the acting was quite good and the story line was interesting . it is a very nice light-hearted film .
i love old movies and this one did not disappoint . it has a good storyline and is fast paced so not boring .
cute and funny . story line is a little weak , but the laughs gets you through the rough spots .
this was a good movie that i watched as a child . it 's good for kids , and the plot is smart and creative enough that adults wo n't be totally bored with it .
great movie . i stayed up late watching it because i was so hooked on it . definitely think you should buy one .
i buy a lot of movies that star robert de niro . i have not watched a movie that he play in that is not a good movie in my thinking .
love the show , brings back great memories and thoughts . i cant wait to order the other years . love it so
very refreshing to see something with real entertainment value . technology may have moved forward , but real entertainment goes on and on .
good old space classic to enjoy , a nice one to enjoy for something different .
a bit sappy , the family angle is good but way over done . but a better than average series if you like sci fi .
i expected the same plot and the same characters but it felt like they were trying way too hard to be funny . it was a bit much when it came to the comedy side and i was expecting funnier
this is one of my all time favorite shows . i love the way aging is presented . i really like that it is a chance to see such good acting done with such heart .
i did not enjoy the movie . my wife seems to enjoy the animation . i would not buy another similar movie .
my favorite tv show has been made into movies . what could be better than seeing the originals back again ? bravo !
walking dead season 1 was a great dvd ! i caught up on things i missed when i did not see season 1 on tv .
definitely not a show for chase fans , but rather fans who like to think . this is a really good thought provoking show .
a disney classic in every way . a movie for the whole family to enjoy , and a way for the young ones to know where a lot of the disney movies started .
this video is what my wife wanted . she has watched it once now . i gave it only 3 star because it was not my selection .
very weird no story what so ever just little girl on the run never came close to las vegas not good movie
if you are a fan of real rock music and it ' history you will love this book too . fascinating insight into three of the most important musicians in rock history .
this is a great farce on the navy , as a marine , and army soldier , nothing makes me happier to see something done so well , and still funny .
i received the movies in good condition and on time all three movies are fabulous movies i thoroughly enjoy them i like a lot of the faith films .
we downloaded this amazon movie because the commercials for it looked so awesome . it was a good movie and the subject matter was unique .
watched to see if i wanted it for my collection did not care for it at all so would not buy it
we love this recent ice age sequel , and are very glad to own our own copy . it has been watched many , many times since its purchase .
loved it . no complaints here . it was a good buy and was glad to make use of it
i 's a very good love movie and a good movie to watch with your family as well and you would never guess you would find a boyfriend like that .
got ta love disney . can not go wrong when it comes to disney movies they are the best . was added to the dvd collection that we have
you know that saying that sequels are not as good as the original , not true for iron man 3 , this is an awesome movie , my children and i truly enjoyed the movie .
it was a pleasure to see a movie about a teenager who is trying to live the right kind of life .
these movies are great sunday afternoon family viewing . throughly enjoyable , and oh so much better than anything at the movies these days . 40 times better the current remake of nancy drew .
love it , love it , love it ! ! ! this is the best written and well acted mini-series in the history of mini-series . i became obsessed with it and ca n't wait for season 4 .
this is a good story ; well written . i 've read the books and found that i like the tv series better . it can be very campy at times , but entertaining non the less .
i was looking for the new movies and did not care for the older shows . i just was not good affects very fake .
i love this movie ... in fact i believe it will always be a treasure in my home for years to come ! !
it was a good movie . a sad one but have to say did enjoy . and no doubt will watch it again .
i love this movie with its special effects , underlying moral of the story and the transition the guy makes throughout .
this is a good movie has it all violence , drama , family , life lessons on making decisions that will change your life . and it has that will make you laugh .
usually i love a lot of movies but this one not so much . i mean it is alright but it is just not the best . i honestly think disney could have done a little bit better .
i collect dvds with jennifer lawrence and this one is one of them . it is really good movie for any comic fans .
i enjoy this movie with it 's twists and turns . the movie came in a timely fashion and i have watched it . the disc is as good as advertised . thanks .
is there anyone who is n't addicted to this show . i hear there 's another season in the works . i hope it 's true !
every time i see this movie i find myself singing the songs and getting caught up with the dancing . the story line is fantastic and i catch something new everytime i watch .
i love the jesse stone series ! ! ! this is a great character and tom plays a great part ! i have all of this series and love each one !
all 3 toy story movies are fun to watch for both the adults and kids in our family . this is a great addition to a family movie collection .

i gave it 5 stars because its one of the best music documentaries ever . i recommend it for all music fans your going to watch it more than once and love it .
great classic movie and many special features available for the whole family to enjoy and you got to love the blue-ray picture !
this is a great collection of episodes and even has a bonus episode in the extras . also has dvd commentary and some deleted scenes .
pretty good move , i just did n't think that it was enjoyable since i could n't relate to everything going on . the movie has great entertainment value and great music . overall a good movie .
wonderful movie . i enjoy it right along with the grandkids . cute story like and fantastic animation . i will watch it again and again .
reminds of the time when i was watching this with my mother as a kid . i just love it so much .
one of the ultimate steven seagal movies . not much shooting , more his fighting and attitude . cool fights , cars , and a few hot ladies .
this movie made no sense to me it was not what i expected because it did not have the original character that got away in it .and the story line was not very good
the first despicable movie was comical and i loved it . this second one was no disappointment . highly recommend watching this movie .
blast ! good times and fun to watch over and over again . i nice enjoyable family movie . took it to work at my office and they 've been playing it now for a week .
just when you think they will run out of material to keep the comedy fresh , they come up with something new and funny to play on . cast continues to impress with great performances ... .
great perry mason dvd . raymond burr is great as perry mason . a must have for that perry mason person in you .
we have the new version of this movie , we decided to get the first one , very interesting , and different from the new one
i was very young when then was on tv . it 's still good and i am enjoying it . i will watch john russell in anything he happens to appear .
this movie went from worst to just plain bad . even with named actors they could not carry this movie as it needed to be .
i liked it . it was mostly geared towards children , with an all animal animated cast ; but had a decent story line and a good flow .
the movie is excellent . i have n't watched it as some ... but it still very good . it arrived in excellent condition . rock hudson is terrific .
this is for my daughter 's birthday and she is going to be so surprised and excited to open this gift !
i could n't even finish this movie . it was sooo cheesy and definitely not what i expected from a movie with sean connery in it .
this is one harry potter movie i had never seen . i enjoyed it although it is not my favorite of the series .
good premise . the suspense kept building . it was recommended to me , and i in turn would recommend it as well .
i did n't like it at all . i did not like the plot . it was very confusing . it was too gory
interesting plots and great characters . the costuming and small historical references are fun . we call it a & # 34 ; murdoch night & # 34 ; when we 've had a tough day .
timothy olyphant never disappoints with his acting , and the movie was pretty entertaining as well . if you like the walking dead , you 'll probably like this movie .
i love this movie . its easy to watch and follow along , funny , and right balance between action and comedy . /
it was a little difficult to follow at first , but when it all comes together ( and it will come together for people at different times throughout the movie ) it is really fabulous .
i just recently bought this dvd ! i died laughing . fun for the whole family to enjoy !
all i can say is , it is about time that this classic was on dvd . my all time favorite !
what more movies should be like today , funny , heartwarming and uplifting as well as entertaining . i have seen it at least 10 times .
this dvd was worth the price i had to pay , because they never show it on tv . excellent movie .
i feel this is one of the most creative and moving stories i have ever seen , inside the trek series and outside ! done to perfection .
this movie is a must see . it 's almost tradition to watch this every christmas . rent it or buy it you wo n't regret it .
this movie is one of the best , i love the fight scenes . i also love the way he can drive a car .
one of our favorite movies . great cast with excellent acting abilities . would want the dvd to be in their own language with english subtitles . do so look forward to the day it is finally released !
we love the mib movies and this is going to be fun to watch with our children . excited about mib iii
this is easily the best star trek spoof ever ! ! the special effects are amazing . i cant wait for their next film .
it was good i just wish it had a lil bit more detail i guess i was expecting a lil better ending .
this is an old movie . no , it is not perfect , but it is one of the better ones . a must have for your home bible movie collection .
it was a very good movie & i enjoyed it & it was so funny that i watched it several times .

this is a really cool movie . we all enjoy watching it a real family film - recommend it to anyone who loves a feel good drama
i saw this in the theatres , and loved every minute of it . i am happy to add it to my collection .
this is one of the great movies that was made in the 60 's . you will want to watch it over and over .
the subject matter is of great interest , so i probably would have been curious and wanting to watch no matter what , but this was a well-done film .
is so fascinating to believe that we can be around this creatures , is only fiction but still is something to dream about
a long and epic movie . i watched it a few times until i passed it along to my daughter . it is a very good - and long - epic movie .
this was such a cool cartoon when i was younger it brought back good times of the show .
i saw this movie in the theater and loved it . i told my husband after that i was going to buy it when it came out on dvd . still love it , such a cute movie !
i was turned on to this movie years ago and it became my instant favorite from time on . i love the british humor and all of the characters . they make me smile every time i watch it .
my 18 month old loves to watch arthur on pbs , so this was a lot of fun for her & # 8230 ; and me !
love this series . great plot and keeps your interest . i have watched it from the beginning and recommend to everyone .
i already owned season one but had to order a second set after one of the dvds became defective ( after years of use ) . i highly recommend this series with a great ensemble cast and exceptional humor .
why would you ask for my opinion when i have not even received the movie as yet . i have not seen it so can not rate it .
one of my new favorite movies . quirky story , excellent cast and very touching underlying love story . excellent for a date at home !
received as ordered . very funny . this is my husbands favorite film staring bob hope . is good fun for the whole family .
another winning horse movie . one of the best . this one kept me on the edge of my seat and touched my heart .
cute . fun . but the ending is unrealistic . it was a chick flick to be sure , but a lot of fun . i just could n't buy the ending .
love this show , has drama with a hint of comedy and some gore in it . great cast that makes the show worth watching
i would recommend this to anyone over the age of 18 years it is not suitable for young children it is very graphic
the only disappoint in this set is that there were so few episodes . i think there were two discs and 8 episodes . cost per episode was a bit higher than usual for the series .
the best in suspense and mystery . very intelligent writing and brilliant acting ! keeps you on the edge of your seat .
great movies we watch all the halloween movies and this one has you on the edge of your seat , i recommend it highly if your are a halloween movies fan
this movie is really quirky and fun . to see the character develop and deal with the real life problems was funny and entertaining .
excellent character and plot development ! watch one or two episodes and you will be completely hooked ! real mob & # 34 ; looking & # 34 ; players ... easy plot to believe !
lots of tragedy but so is life ... i am enjoying the life journey of this series ... so much class and well acted .
it is a good movie but not quite a 5 star to me , did enjoy it and sure others will and do also , just added to my collection
another john wayne movie for my collection . i have always enjoyed robert mitchum . the two actors make a good pair .
i just got it in the mail . but i have not watched it yet . but i will soon . i seen this movie when i was a kid and i loved it .
this is one of the best adventure movies of all time . filled with thrills and awesome cg affects that make it seem like your in middle earth yourself ! ! !
i absolutely love everything about this movie . it 's just so intriguing to me . it makes me want to go back and live in the great depression . strange . i know .
elements of a mystery , powerful storyline , great acting and in a time period that we all identify with as emotional .
a well put together story in the continuation of the thor saga and love story .
action movie and you know that action will be in the next scene . by the end you do not care ,
i enjoy this movie . fun music and has a good message for children . love the characters ! good cute humor . i can watch this more then once and not get sick of it .
this is just as good as the original . that 's not always the case . this is a great chic flick and honestly you should own both versions ! for the price you ca n't beat it !

i watched this late at night and was pleasantly suprised that i actually enjoyed it . nice movie if you are into the type of material presented .
totally loved this film , it 's an eye opener . leonardo dicaprio did a great job and i loved all the interviews . 2 thumbs up .
i thought it would be better than it was . its ok but not great . bought it for my grandson but he didnt even sit through the whole movie . he didnt like it .
the only reason i have this 4 stars and not 5 is because most of the extras are n't in hd . but the feature films themselves are unbelievable !
best movie ever . will recommend to others . this was given to my brother as a gift which he loved it .
i looked for this movie for awhile , and am happy i found it ! to me this movie is fun to watch !
such a funny movie . love all the characters ! ! michael caine is just to funny for words . if you are down this will bring you up for sure . delightful !
this movie has interesting characters and a good story line . i would highly recommend this movie . we love the dragons .
i 'm not a big fan of tom c. but i love him as a bad guy in this movie . : )
i absolutely love star wars ! ! i have been waiting til they go on sale and finally bought them ! cant wait to watch them
it was a good movie , i would have paid to see it in the theater . it was nice to see a different take on a story that has been around as long as snow white .
this was extremely bad . could not believe what i was seeing . it was poorly filmed and just plain bad . i do not suggest
my favorite ! keep the episodes coming and we 'll be sure to watch ! you have to love & # 34 ; early & # 34 ; !
kind of a mash up of movies . was like men in black only with ghosts , but saw a lot of familiar elements that reminded me of other movies . but it was entertaining and pretty clean .
at the same time ordering the 2nd season i ordered the third my husband is really enjoying this series thanks again .
ca n't get enough of the current sherlock - truly brilliant adaptation . although there are only 3 episodes , they are each 1 1/2 hours long .
i have truly loved all the downton abbey series . all of the actors are so good . can hardly wait until the next one comes out ! ! ! !
i found out about this show on the pbs website and was happy to find it on amazon prime . the actors do a good job and has a well written plot .
excellent cartoon for boys and girls alike . well drawn , inventive plots and memorable characters .
debbie reynolds , singing and dancing ... who could ask for anything better ! wonderful family musical . i would recommend this to anyone looking for a fun , family , musical .
classic movies are still the best ! this movie covered a period of history . it was extremely well acted , the story line was brilliant .
good story , very funny and family friendly , i will recommend anyone who like to watch morning show or harrison ford to have this movie in their collection .
nowhere near as good as the first three . if they are going to use ( the bourne ) as part of the name of the movie they need to do better than that .
all i have to say is great . i could watch these movies all the time . and i have watched it a few times .
this is a great movie and is part of my christmas collection that i watch every year . great family movie .
had n't seen this since i was a kid . still a great movie , but a little long . worth a watch if you want a lazy sunday afternoon !
this was a great story . great story line , great acting by all . everyone loved it and we watched it many a time . would highly recommend this one .
it was a good movie and although i enjoyed it , the first was a much better story line than this .
a few moments of laughter but not as good as i thought it was going to be ; worth to watch once and maybe again in 2 years
this was given as a gift to my son . i hope he likes it , but i have no idea what it is like .
3 year old loves this movie . she has watched both of them 5 times since we got the movies . thanks
this too was a purchase for a grandson . he loves the game and everything he can read or see about it . i watched this with him and it was a fun story .
do it do it has to be my favorite part ! not an oscar winner or anything but definitely a fun campy movie
i mainly bought this movie because i have seen it previously and also because my whole family is a fan of adam sandler movies . very , very funny movie .
that brief period where science fiction meets humor . something with the old drive in theater . but there was absolutely no disappointment . i 'm still looking for other classics i remember as a child .
its really sad when the best thing about this movie is 5 amazing actors taking off their clothes . but the story like kinda sucked , and it left you hanging when mike just left ...
love this movie . oldie but goodie . pure enjoyment . totally to be viewed for a fun night . will not be disappointed .
i bought this video for my 2 year old who loves elmo ... it has little to do with the true meaning of christmas and the plot becomes repetitive ... terrible dvd or video
if you like the cast , it is a great shoot em up , not much of a story line tho , but good for this type of film .
so much better than the first and being that the first was so incredible , that is saying a lot . this one will make ya scream out loud and then laugh about it afterwards .
i did n't think this movie was that great . i give it two stars because i enjoy both the main characters , but other than that it was not worth seeing .
this movie is a classic ! i enjoyed hearing all those wonderful songs . the performances were stellar ! i would watch this over & over again .
this maybe a first , a combo of three movies on three discs that are all relatively good together . good buy for the customer and saves space in the process .
i did n't care to keep watching around the hour mark , but i wanted to know what happened . it 's a funny concept , but does n't deliver the laughs .
i thoroughly enjoyed this movie , its a kids movie that adults can enjoy as well . i highly recommend it to anyone who likes pixar movies .
not what i expected . acting was n't up to par and the story line put us to sleep . no thank you
very good movie . it will keep you guessing and on the edge of your seat .
wonderful story that continues on . disney has done it again . need more stories like this to be available for young ladies to see .
not the best movie ever but not the worse either it did help me kill sometime . but there are defiantly better movies to see , but ok if you want to kill some time .
watched most of these years ago and was not disappointed viewing them again , he always made movies with good content .
this is an awesome movie and fun for all ages , bought as a christmas gift for my adult son . enjoy it
heart felt and moving film based on a true story . well worth an evenings rental . a must see film for the family .
i saw this movie in theaters , and i thought it was adorable ! the music is fantastic , and there were a lot of lines in there to make parents laugh , as well as children .
love the program ... love the actors . i will some day own all the seasons . i love this kind of entertainment as i 'm going to bed .
well i thought this movie was bad . the special effects were sooo bad they made you laugh . but it was very violent and the language was high which i thought would be r rating
great group of actors , great scripts & directing ( what more can anyone ask ? ) -- will continue to buy any more that come out on the market !
bought this to replace a missing season of my collection . content rocks and quality of dvd 's are good overall too .
i had already seen this movie and liked it and the the reason i bought it . i 'm in the market for all kinds of old movies , so keep offering what ever you have . thank you !
johnny depp is so great in this movie . he does a great job and this is just a great watch for any age
not bad for a free amazon prime instant video , it held my attention with it 's very unique format , and shows that it is possible to make an entertaining film on a low budget .
this play was great but you better sit down and have nothing else to do to watch it because its one of the long ones . still loved it though .
if you do n't have this movie , buy it and give it a watch . you wo n't be disappointed .
it is not the greatest in terms of filming , but the acting is good and for what they could do , they did well . of course , the book is excellent . another rainy day movie fix !
great chemistry in this movie and very believable ! loved it almost as much as the first one ! ! ! very romantic and beautiful city for background !
i brought this movie for a friends son and i heard he watches it every night before he goes to bed .
i enjoyed every minute of it . it was a very clever movie and well done . just when i thought i had figured it out , it would take a turn in another direction .
i love the office . i saw every episode and am very excited to have the dvd 's so i can watch them whenever i want .
what 's there to not like about doris day . anything she did was worth watching and she always had good leading men to work with .
i had heard so much about this movie i just had to see it for myself . it 's so funny . parts of it are slow but it 's a great movie overall .
i enjoy this type of movie and i was told it was not very good but i have watched this movie 6 times now .
makes you want to think ! still why the kids ? these type of movies make you think people around you are scared .
i more or less grew up on & # 34 ; secret agent man & # 34 ; , and now i get to see the first seasons that started it all .
i thought that this was a good movie . it was n't the best ive seen but over all it was good .
five stars for this type of movie . everything i expected it to be . would recommend to others that like this type of film .
i loved this movie very much for the real life situations and great acting . i highly recommend it . superb movie !
this is a good movie and i would request it to my friends . i was pleased with everything about it
big bang theory is still amazingly funny and its on its 6 season . i love this show and is even better on blu ray nothing to complain about .
this movie was very good , kevin and supporting cast make a great effort to make this movie and it worked , will not win anything , but worth watching .
i love this movie , so glad to have it in blu-ray ! ! my daughter and i enjoy watching al the disney movies together !
i enjoyed every show maybe we will get lucky some one will make more star trek shows i hope this helps
this will be watched many times in our house . it 's really cute and has a great reminder / lesson for grown ups . good for kids of all ages - i would suggest 4 and up .
this is a great movie for everyone to enjoy . there 's a sequel coming out soon , i hope it 's as good as this one !
this was a very good movie ! it has plenty of action and drama ! it is a good family movie also ! i enjoyed it very much !
i really like this movie . i have enjoyed watching it with my daughter many , many times . it 's kinda sad in certain parts but all ends well .
so glad this is finally out . great show . lots of fun ! someone at warner finally grew a brain ! thanks so much !
i love all the twilight movies . good acting for the cast . this movie was excellent . you wo n't regret buying it for your collection .
this has slightly cheesy effects since it is from the 90 's , but its still great and well done in my opinion
easy syfy movie to follow the story was great the acting was great and the surprise ended unexpected . do n't know who that kid is but i hope he sticks to acting .
exceptional and the streaming quality was fantastic . this was a superb movie in he fast and furious sequels . i was impressed also with how smooth the streaming was .
this was a typical bond movie . it had alot of action . the plot was somewhat convoluted , but worth watching . i would reccomend watching .
the first time i watched this dvd , i laughed so hard that i was crying ! ! richard pryor was a comic genius ! ! ! !
fabulous acting and a wonderful movie . this was exceptional ! the story line was just wonderful and i was enthralled by this movie . m loved it !
the movie is almost an entire video of laughter . even though it was filmed about 30 years it 's still a good movie .
they kill lots of witches in this movie but they also kind of missed the mark . i guess if there is nothing else on , then i would watch this movie , but really only once .
i have had the original vhs copy . then i just had to have it on dvd . was hoping it would come out in blu-ray soon .
the movie was very good . a little long but keep you interested in it . everyone should buy & watch this movie .
the movie was long and slow . my brother and i fell asleep through most of it . i 'm glad i did n't go to the theater to watch it .
i loved this series when it was first on tv and i still do , even more so . great character interaction .
this is my favorite paul newman movie and one of my favorite movies of all time . paul was a clever character and he provided great entertainment to all who watch this movie .
had previously watched this series , and loved it . had to have it for my dvd collection . always get top quality ordering new or used .
this was good mindless entertainment . i enjoyed the special effects . the actors did a good job . i was entertained and would watch it again .
what a stupid plot , what a stupid movie and shame on russell crowe for taking the part . he must have needed the money .
this has always been a good movie to watch . there are some movies we watch all the time and this is one of them .
week story line , could not hold my attention , so i lost why i was watching the movie . the switch from real to animation was done very badly .
i read the book and i 've watched this movie several times . i enjoy it more each time i view it !
i watched pooh with my sons , and now with my grand son , you just ca n't go wrong with pooh . who ca n't fall in love with the friends at pooh corner ?
not as good as the 1st but , it was filmed 10 years later . so i still liked it . i 'm a huge fan of mib movies . : d
we rented pi over the holiday , we wanted a family movie we could enjoy . we all found that pi deserved the academy awards earned recently . we really enjoyed it .
loved the short film that angela robinson created - the full film version was interesting and entertaining . i was laughing through most of it . its a spoof of spy films and is hilarious .
a nice movie for a family movie night ... not something you 're going to watch over and over , but a good evening 's entertainment .
one of the best superhero movies ever made ! epic ! i loved ever minute of this movie . watch it two times at the movies . a classic !
love it that a girl is so brilliant in this movie . great actors , really fast paced , blow your mind action . the end is so unexpected . got ta get this movie !
i thought it was another tv show i watched as a kid but it was n't . the series was ok. i would n't recommend it .
she jumped for joy ! had seen it before , was on her list for christmas ... she already had the first mermaid tale .
i love the series naruto but i usually get it at best buy but their prices are so high as of late but this was a great deal
if you are a harry potter fan , this is another great movie to add to your collection .
we like jason statham movies and we were not disappointed . he and robert deniro were great in this ! it really keeps your interest up with the way no one is what they seem !
best of the series with a well developed story with parts 1 and 2 and 4 hours to make the story better .
i bought this for a gift and did not see the person to give it to them so i can not tell you what the movie is about .
an adorable movie with great music and the marvelous danny kaye . it does show it 's age though . watch it with a child .
the movie is enlightening and showing how things were back in those days . i really enjoyed it . no complaints here .
kind of like `` mad max '' in space . a sci-fi b movie but i find it entertaining . ( but then i like sci fi b movies )
story line was good and action not so bad but not the greatest . something to watch in simple night or day .
suspense , drama , action , and eye catching . full of i ca n't leave the tv scenes because you are scared of missing something , but ca n't figure out which was better 1 or 2
the 5th season is great . i ca n't wait to see season 6 if i can find it at a reasonable price .
i saw the trailer 's for this movie and it was a great movie that i added to my collection . it did arrive earlier that expected
i loved this movie when i was a kid , and i got it so quickly that i watched it the same day it was received .
watched this movie on television , went out the next day , bought this film . it 's simply a fun and wonderful story . your dvd library needs this one !
if you want to laugh watch this movie . i 've seen it a couple of times with different friends ! ! give it a try !
the item showed up nice and fast as well as the price was good , in the end it turned out to be 5 movies , one of the disks has 2 movies on it , bonus , thanks .
not the best effort by lancaster . the movie looked like it was made for tv , and lacked the punch it should have had .
i was glad to see dexter get closer to being the dexter of earlier seasons . one of the best series out there .
the bluray came as packaged and the quality of it was perfect . the movie , on the other hand , was alright . but the quality of the product was perfect .
this series is another which is on top of my must have list . great action , and humor , ca n't ask for a better cast .
i love this anime and it definitely meet my expectations i watched it twice when i first got it and it was good quality
i can not add anything to what has been said before , just wanted to put my five star rating on this film as well as this release .
i am crazy about this movie , it was very well made , it does n't hurt to like some of the players , i watch this over and over .
this is a fun movie to watch with the family . it is funny , clever , and creative . grab some popcorn kick back and enjoy !
acting was good , but i was disappointed by the movie overall . i 'm not even sure why . would not recommend this movie..
i like robert duvall in anything . he always seems , especially in westerns to give the viewers a taste of what the old west was really like .
criterion as always does an excellent job with this movie . and this is the best version to get . highly recommend !
ca n't really say much more . dumb story , bad acting , the kind that does n't make a movie badly good .
love this series . always loved medical shows and this is one of the best .
gary moore if you have n't already heard him play , is a great guitar player . if you like guitar i suggest this on blu-ray ! ! ! !
i have already recommended it to a few friends who love romantic comedy . de niro was great ! i love that it was n't all about the younger people .
never heard of this movie , my daughter told me about it . i purchased it for her , we watched it together , i loved it ! !
a real classic chick flick . such a great movie that all women should watch . i would absolutely recommend this movie .
not quite what i expected . it was a good movie . love the color . story line was good . just was n't my type of movie .
it had been yrs since i had seen this and was interesting to see again and share with others who had view before also
i watched the first season and enjoyed it very much . i plan to watch the other two as well . excellent .
this was typical film about one man 's struggle against many forces of evil . you 've seen it all many times before . this one perhaps a tad above average for this type of storyline .
glad i found it and ca n't wait to watch it with my brother on our next movie date fun fun
this is one of the best videos i 've ever seen for children . my grandchildren love seeing this over and over again .
one of the better gay films in recent years . great script , acting and directing . a very moving film a must see
this is a great program . well done and interesting . i learned a lot by watching it , and it has had a positive effect on my life .
pretty much all his movies are great and of consistent quality . i actually have n't seen some of these , so looking forward to that .
great movie . very funny & the research seems to follow very true to the era ... we love it !
if you like listening to queen , the you need this dvd . freddy may be gone , but this dvd will bring him back . the video quality is good and the song selection is good .
this is the fifth one we have gotten , some as gifts and my husband is hooked on old westerns from his childhood
most awesome cast . a wonderful story line , beautiful setting . a really awesome movie . love it & will watch it again for sure .
you get two for your money ; and they are well worth watching . kids would enjoy these too . anyone who likes adventure films should like these .
i have seen this movie many times and wanted to have a copy in my personal library so that i may watch it whenever i 'd like . it is a very good movie .
while i was bored to tears watching the video my grandaughter ( 10 ) seems to enjoy dancing along to it . most of the lessons are for adults and complicated but she does seem to have fun .
i bought this as a gift for my dad , but i remember it from when i was a kid and it was a riot . i remember hearing my dad laugh so loud at it .
the movie lets you think one way and then you find it taking you on a totally different journey , very interesting .
i like tom hanks was kind a different movie for him . was not real excited about it . was okay but you kind a got lost if you missed any moment of it .
this is a funny classic . i purchased it to watch with a few friends . thanks to this site i was able to purchase it for a very low price and it was shipped very quickly .
great movie , great action , well done . it will put you on the seat of your chair watching it . very interesting movie .
classic arnold . worth the cost of the rental . plenty of action and funny at the same time . worth the rental .
not quite my cup of tea but my sister loved it . no real edgy stuff but a fun watch . maybe a good family film .
i have seen this move perhaps 6 times and i will probably see it again . elizabeth and rock at their best .
this was a very good movie with good acting and a good story . i would recommend this movie to my family and friends .
movie was ok but i 'm not a fan of the alien series anyway . but i guess it was interesting none the less .
at moments it 's a little difficult to understand because it 's a dream over a dream ... i need to see it again , i did n't understand the final part ...
when will the dvd of this great film be released ? ! the performances ... amazing . a real look at gay life at that time ... a time that seems so long ago : ( !
it great show i have watch every time it on love all they in the show it funny and great to watch
nothing more to say but i enjoyed the program very much and will probably not do any more ratings because i feel forced to say something when the stars say it all for me .
it was funny and touching at the same time . josh d is superb eye candy . predictable , but worth my time .
a gift for my husband . he loves old musicals so will be looking forward to watching it when the holiday rush is over .
excellent 3d , one of the best i 've seen . i have over 60 3d movies and this is one of the best !
this was quite the most interesting of halle berry 's movie with the sex scenes and such . it was just okay for me .
my grandson loves this movie and now i need to purchase 3 for him . im so glad i can go back and forward to buy any movies i need for my family and myself ... .
when i saw this as a kid i really did not get it , now that i am older i think it is a real comedy classic .
this was a decent movie and crazy how it was based on actual events . an older but alright movie . not bad .
my grandpa was so happy when he opened this for his birthday yesterday . it arrived right on time , and his face was so worth it !
well acted , great script . people who know big business and the stock market will like this . it was over my head , but the basic plot line was interesting .
great acting , great directing , great story : what more could you ask for . blood and violence is not what i enjoy in today 's movies
this is a very funny movie . these two have great comedic appeal . this is one of our classic go to movies when we want to laugh .
i love the madea movies , but this one less of her , the main character , i would have liked to have seen more of madea in this dvd !
this was boring and the story was not put together well . i was rooting for the bad guys just for this to be over .
although this is a kids movie i found it very fun to watch . it had great laughs and a good story line .
happy to find this on amazon . all episodes are playing fine so far . there are many episodes on each disk so this was definitely worth the money ! reasonable price for this set .
thank you family enjoyed movie . accurate in description and in perfect condition great price . have shared with friends to enjoy as well . and purchase another for my grandson
the setting is interesting , the story is good and the subject is important . however the movie as a whole i found boring . but should have known that from the title : lots of talking .
i really in joy watching that show on tv now i have the complete collection to watch
this is a great and hilarious movie adaptation of the phenomenal tv show . great actors and just fantastic writing that really kept true .
better than the first one as the story line seemed more complete . still it needs a little something to be a great movie .
just what i needed . glad i 'm not the only one buying this but it was worth it . i use it several times a week now .
great family movie , for all ages , had a great story line . disney just keeps getting better with their movies . wonderful ! ! !
i enjoyed this series very much and i am looking forward to the next season . i hope it will be on prime very soon .
dark and disturbing with lots of the usual violence , but i like the stories , so wanted to own the set .
this is an awesome and very sad movie . cameron diaz was great in this movie . excellent to watch but not often .
i was very happy with my movie- it was in great condition , and delivery was prompt . i 'm truly enjoying it -
always will be one of my favorite shows . the characters all work so well together and make for great tv .
we have watched this movie several times although we 've only had it for a few months . great action , thrilling story . happy to add it to our alien series .
i do n't know how maggie smith got into this . just not my genre ! not funny , not entertaining , not suspense , just boring .
a fun movie that plays with the idea of time travel and the consequences . quite imaginative and interesting . engrossing from beginning to the end .
this is a great movie that my family and i enjoy watching every year ! if you are looking for good family entertainment at christmas time , this is it !
had some funny parts but overall was just too nasty with their language and everything for it to be considered a great movie .
veggie tales delivers again as the kids love these movies . it 's great that they come out with different ones so the kids can learn different things about life and god !
i got this for mothers day too and my mom loved it like i do , it 's a very good movie .
not much to say here , it 's a disney movie , but at the same time it 's not a disney movie , if that makes any sense . definitely worth watching
move of all time . i never get tired of the comedy in this movie . even have my kids watching with me whenever i put it on . great buy .
i really dig this movie . i am a huge fan of far out love stories and this is surely on of the most far out .
this is an incredible ballet workout , i find myself doing this one the most . it really deliver results ! a really nice change from high impact but dont let that fool ya ! you will get results !
i really enjoyed this movie ! it was full of action and suspense and the ending was pretty cool . i would recommend this move for any who like suspense and horror
loved the movie and loved the 3d . a must have for any one building a 3d blu ray library at home .
80 's tech , 80 's style and great actors . the story was well written and even the sequel in this set was good .
one of my favorite movies ever . cant believe its on blu ray . obviously not as sharp as a modern movie but the best transfer available right now
love the show . it is too bad it is not on any more , i would like to see this continue .
i like all of tyler perry 's work so of course i 'm going to buy these . and their really funny , too .
excellent , one of the best musicals ever made . the cast is terrific and they all did their own singing .
i ca n't wait until another one comes out , i love his movies . this was very well time spent and money
my son is a true shark fanatic and this was as good as gold for him . he loved and will watch it over and over guaranteed ! ! ! !
i loved the lost series and could n't wait to watch it every week . i was disappointed with the final episode of the final season .
tyler perry has done it again ! hilarious movie ! ! i could watch it over and over again and still laugh just as hard as i did the first time ! ! !
loved watching the hbo series dead wood with timothy olyphant . was very pleased to discover the justified series as it too is excellent written and produced .
that 's about all i can say about this `` new '' set . if you do n't own any of them yet , i can see getting this set , but other than that ? ? ?
i think this is a great movie . i teach fourth grade . we read the book and then watch the movie for comparison . the students love the book and the movie .
they do n't get any better than this if you love westerns , adventures , period movies , well you name it . do n't even think about it any longer , buy a copy of this great flick
this is a fantastic historical drama . the writing , acting , and attention to detail for scenery and costume are all outstanding .
not bad at all . it keeps you wondering who it was until the conclusion . some cheese but not much .
tarantino does n't have even half the creativity and originality the director of this movie had . this british production is very good , you care about the characters .
i love this story - the characters are perfectly cast and the story is everything one would expect from a masterpiece theater presentation . i ca n't wait for season 4 .
i 'm going to love this new season . i so much enjoyed the other 2 and have watched them more than once .
did not get to watch this before . love al pacino . thrilled with purchase . hard to find pacino movies in stores .
this is one of the few movies in which norris does a good job of acting .
laughed the whole way through the movie in the theater so just had to have it in the collection for the house !
was a good movie with lots of action and it was very entertaining with lot of suspense to it . i would recommend the movie .
i watched this on the hallmark channel the first time and have seen it several times and when i saw it on amazon i purchased it .
i have n't seen this since i was younger and i enjoy this movie very much . you made it possible for me to own this awesome movie .
this i have from sometime ago an excellent movie it is here on my shelf dvd and vhs cant remember when ordered thank you
another one of our holiday favorites , we will now be able to watch year round . this is a fantastic family film with great values .
my daughter likes this movie but it is not one of her favorites . she likes the first one better .
this will be another great series . not quite as great as the lord of the rings , but a good series none the less .
i 'm a fan so of course i had to buy this why else would n't i ? ! but besides that i think its a really cool show very imaginative : )
glad to find this very entertaining old movie on dvd and much enjoyed since . it came in excellent condition and in a timely manner .
i love this show . i think my husband and i watched all the episodes within three days . will watch again .
i 'm not a race car fan but really enjoyed this movie . like the way they brought some behind the driving pieces out .
this is a workout i always use . i just hope there will be a dvd format for this program before my vhs wear out .
the order was received in only 3 days . thank you for your speedy service . i will definately choose you again . thank you .
possibly the best season of any t.v . show that ever was and ever will be . i love it . that is all .
hello world , well written decent acting and nice effects . good amount of gore and atmosphere the story is decent and creepy as hell . dont bring this one to christmas dinner !
great for christmas ! ! ! ! my grandson loves it and it is pleasant to watch for and old , old man like me !
this is a train documentary featuring johnny cash filmed in the 70 's . no concert or concert footage here . johnny cash talks about the evolution of trains and sings some train songs along the way .
this show has adventure , laughs , romance , and it makes you think ! there is lots there for everyone ! i have really enjoyed it !
enjoyed this tv show a lot . hoping to see more of these interesting ladies and good story lines . i hope there will be more seasons to come .
great movie i definitely recommend it and you can watch it without watching the actual show and still understand it which is great .
another wonderful 80s movie i think im gon na go back in time and live in the 80s life was so much easier ! ! ! love this film ! ! !
i simply love this series . only ones that can compare to it are revenge and fringe . each season just seems to get better and better .
glenn ford is one of my all time fav stars . this was one of his best movies ! great entertainment , clean fun , funny !
garfield is the greatest cat . my 3 year old wore out her other copy , so i got this one to replace it .
every bit as good as the book . i look forward to the next movie and i will be adding it to my video library .
second time to see this movie . enjoyed it because of the unusual plot , but nevertheless it was an old movie .
not the best but decent for a one time watch with the kids or family . kind of boring to me however .
i literally watched this back to back . loved it from begining to end . the animation and story are great . my family thoroughly enjoyed this .
another great movie of action and great actors . wonderful twist at the end . a must have for any dvd collection
jeff dunham 's dvd 's are great , i have 6 so far , they keep you laughing . it only took a few days to get to me
having been a huge fan of star trek from its first days on tv , this movie is a fantastic addition to the journey and well worthy of the series .
i really enjoyed this movie . i 'm at the beach every chance i get , so this was a home run for me . the story was great and the scenery was amazing . fun movie
my husband ordered this and he loved it . i usually do not like this kind of film but to my surprise i enjoyed it also . received quickly . in condition as stated .
one of my favorite movies ever and my very favorite christmas movie . the cast is superb and they all seem to be having a good time . you just ca n't help but feel good after watching .
a thoroughly enjoyable series . sorry that it only lasted one season . the characters are quirky and fun . the stories are very imaginative .
i 'm basically just writing this to give the movie one star and hopefully save some people from such a tragic loss of time .
one of the most frightening movies i have ever seen . not for the faint of heart . i would see it again .
what a great concept . to put four wonderful classic movies in one package is absolutely terrific . item came in great condition and promptly .
did n't like the vulgar language right off the bat and every other word . hard to see ben like that too
this makes a nice compliment to my collection of early frankenstein movies . these movies are digitally enhanced and very clear .
good movie got it for my brother as a birthday gift and he liked it . nice movie overall to go along with the first one .
i liked this dvd very much . good action , and a good buy too . this is a great site to shop and i will keep buying from it .
this is ncis at its best ! ca n't wait to see what comes next ! seems like each season is better than the previous one !
this movie was very interesting and a good & # 34 ; who did it ? & # 34 ; type movie . denzel washington always good acting . this will keep you guessing until the end .
i love this sweet romantic movie . it 's a magical christmas movie that 's great for families . it 's one of our favorite christmas time movies .
different but great movie , not as good as the original wizard of oz , but then what would be ? but still worth watching .
i just did n't enjoy this movie i thought it was slow and storyline was predictable . i would not recommend this movie to friends .
oh yes , this is the africa i remember of my childhood and youth - well acted and of course , magnificent scenery
if you have n't honestly seen this yet buy the movie now call in sick to work and get some popcorn !
this one of my favorite dvd i remember seeing this when i was young this a true classic in my book one of the best
really enjoying this series . the characters are all growing up and changing this season , including the adults , and that 's a good thing .
if you have not seen this one what are you waiting for superb acting and i could n't stop laughing , & # 34 ; you got to see the dude & # 34 ;
this show reminds me of when i was little and it is filled with great humor and feeling ! i recommend getting it ! it came on time and was in great condition !
i had heard of this movie from die hard horror fans for years . this film lived up to expectations and is a solid , classic , film .
this is an excellent movie that could not be found until now . so if you want a perfect performance and an unusual story line this movie is for you .
poor story line . the movie was carried with excellent acting by some characters . something was definitely lacking here . i would not rent it again .
it was ok not as good as the other ones but good to watch would recommend it to any one .
kevin spacey is so believeable and loveable . i can watch this movie over and over .
it was a good christmas movie . i enjoyed it very much . i will watch it next christmas and new year .
this movie is the top pick by all my grandkids ( 13 ) as one of their favorites ! !
i really liked this movie but i had to watch it a couple times to like it . the filming is a little dark and it took me a couple times to warm up to it .
watched this movie and immediately ordered the book it was based on . there are two other books that follow it also . very good movie . definitely gives us something to think about .
a great movie from start to finish , with great acting , photography , and an outstanding score !
i have all the cds to this series and my children watch it again and again . this is a fun family show and we enjoy watching it
i love this tv series . season three is just as good as one and two . i look forward to season four .
you could see how this could happen . love is good , sad , and funny . this is all three . jennifer aniston and jason bateman both play good parts ,
i really liked this movie . it was funny and yet it still made ya tear up . interesting premise ... made me think about what i would do in that situation .
this movie is going to suck , just like people who write reviews of movies they have n't seen yet .
it was great from the start to the end . i wish they made movies like that now . but they do not .
for a 70 's movie it was not bad to watch for a retro movie
if you have n't seen this movie you 're really missing out its really funny and different its really a must see !
i enjoy this movie . i had my husband watch it for the first time and he enjoyed it as well .
i watched this movie when it first came out on tv . i purchased a copy for me and my boys . we like suspenseful and scary movies ! !
i have watched this movie for years and still watch it every christmas . it 's a classic and well acted . it 's one of my favorite christmas movies .
the best way to own this is on blu-ray ! the memories this brings are well worth owning it , and it gives me something to share with my family .
this is an underrated movie . very cute , some action , some romance , loveable characters ... what 's not to like ? ! so glad this was available through my favorite online store !
this movie makes 3d great and also the bluray is wonderfully done . highly recommend this movie as a reference of all others to compare !
i was pleasantly surprised with this one . mother kept me interested from the start to the end . the acting from the lead character was really believable . i enjoyed this one and recommend it .
i must say , it 's my least favorite of the series of iron man . i liked the first and second one much much more .
definitely worth the price ! three dvds for what you 'd normally pay for one in the store . any serious doctor who collector must have these stories !
actually i do n't love it , but my sister does , she is absolutely happy ! is great . she watch it every day .
i do n't know what she thought of it , we do n't speak any more but i have seen it on tv and like it just fine
we originally rented this movie through netflix and liked it so much , we bought it here . great story , superb acting .
it starts as a family drama and ends as a greek tragedy in between it is well worth watching . great story with great characters .
i really enjoyed the show . there are always twists and turns i never expect to keep me on my toes .
nothing great , but was something to watch , i thought it would be better then it was but why not watch it
i had rented this movie and ended up buying it and the book because i liked it that much . you do n't know what or when something going to happen to you in life .
one of the best horror movies i have seen since dead alive . a must see for cult horror movie fans .
i know this got rave reviews , but i was n't a huge fan . bullock is great in it , but the movie itself was n't good .
this movie had its funny moments but was not as good as the original .
very interesting movie . i totally enjoyed it . i would recommend it to all .
my mom had given me this for christmas , and once we watched it , she wanted it for herself . so she 's getting it this coming christmas .
they just turned 20 and i only recently discovered them while in england and loved em ! had to get the video in usa format !
i was very excited to see this . it is well done , with an all-star japanese cast . it is very faithful to the book .
a great , good guys win against all odds , movie with lots of action . i love that it is family friendly .
i choose this rating just because i am a huge fan of the whole underworld saga . i recommend this movie to those that like action movies about werewolves and vampires .
i have never been in charlie brown , even though i love dogs . i bought this for my husband who has never watched it
arnold does another great kid movie . i love this , when my kids were younger this came out and now it 's a christmas must see .
not my type of show . hard to follow . but the costumes were fantastic and i loved the history behind the show .
this movie is a great glimpse of europe at its best . the time is one of the most interesting in history .
this movie has a very good story and a great ending . it will put you in the christmas spirit . i highly recommend .
i use to have this on vhs tape i never knew this was on dvd now i found it yay !
we watch this movie every christmas and never get tired of watching it , . this year we sat and watched all of them !
this was what she wanted and thank you for it also she is very pleased with this dvd movie to
the kids really loved this . we liked it too . exciting . nice to choose 3-d version or standard version .
the movie i rated only 3 stars as it reminded me of so many others . also , i thought the movie was drawn out in some areas .
i bought this really brings back high school memories . great music and footage . i would recommend this to any journey fan .
we laughed lots during this movie . it was sweet and funny . good to see older actors doing good work . our teenager like it too .
the best season of the series and the best of all the sequels of all the others after the original .
i enjoyed the acting but the story was predictable and overly done . there was one or two unpredictable twists in it to make it entertaining enough for me not to notice the length .
i can not comment on this i bought this for a friend who is a big fan . i only saw one episode . thanks again .
i love this show ! i grew up in the 1970 's watching this series . i am glad they put onto dvd ! i highly recomend this to anyone that loves action drama !
you know , you think it 's so funny , you quote what they said in your own situation ? really funny , romantic and a glimpse at life a long time ago .
gave it a try and did not exactly enjoy it . the audio and video was okay and the price was okay .
really should be a comic book fan before watching this or skip it . just could not stay interested in it .
a nice little movie to relax with . have seen it several time . been a few years in between so was nice to watch it again .
there is a lot of fun , some bad special effects and a good time watching these many different science fiction shows .
this movie was extraordinary . i really like the story and that a teacher can make a difference , not in a class , in a whole school . great !
i 've become completely addicted to this show . this is one of the better shows on tv right now and glad i gave it a chance .
it 's an inspiring story of being your best and living with kindness towards others in spite of what they do to you .
watch often , waiting on final movie , but with regrets as it is the final chapter in the story .
great movie ! my boys loved it growing up , so i wanted my two grandsons to see it . ca n't go wrong with redford .
we love this movie . it is a great movie for the family to watch . i highly recommend this movie for a family movie night .
they delivered everything as promised when i ordered . i was very happy and would definitely order again from this site .
i remember the movie , even though i bought it for a gift . it was fun , good old movie star stuff .
went to the theater to see this also . great movie with action throughout . some unrealistic stunts , but its nothing different than the rest of the fast movies .
good price for a good movie that we had to have for our collection . i 'm going to keep writing because amazon thinks i should write more even though i have nothing more to say .
men in black is always good . fun watching and a lot of laughter . like the actors . go for it . you will like it .
i got these for my wife . she always loved every episode or every film series . it made her smile for a long time .
this was a great movie ! i read the book and while it was not exactly like the book , it was a good rendition of it .
nice short love story . perfect for watching on a cold winter night . enjoyed it in a movie marathon night . would recommend .
jag is one of my favorite older series . i was thrilled to be able to get all the seasons from amazon .
this is a coming of age film about two people who meet and eventually fall in love then something goes terribly wrong and one of them has to deal with the loss of his first love .
thought this was well done and would rate it as a good chick flick . this would be a good date movie .
this is a great classic for any movie collection . completely forgot how good this movie was . would definitely recommend for any movie collection .
love these movies . i brought this dvd for my mother , but she has past on . she grew up and love the debbie reynolds movies
the effects of the movie are good , the plot is original , the acting was ok. it was a nice movie to watch , but there was just something missing to me .
i had heard a lot about this series and decided to try it . it was fine but do n't think i want to pay $ 2 per episode , so i gave it a 4 .
i like it , i did n't love it . it has lots of actions and good acting , but it just wasnt for me . i say if the price is write go ahead and buy it .
i love this series and this latest one is of course the best . if this is the last then it certainly ended on a high note .
brilliant acting by all those involved , vivid and rich atmosphere . hits the sense of time and place perfectly . a joy to watch .
i liked this movie but it still do n't compare to the first one but is still better than the second one
i have the first movie , and saw that i needed this one . so i ordered it for my collection and enjoyed it .

i love love love this show ! the dvd set is great ! i 'm looking forward to more seasons ! bring it on !
my grandson will stop whatever he is doing if this tom & jerry movie comes on . this cartoon movie is so well done and so close to the original movie that we all have enjoyed watching it .
robert duvall is one of my all time favorite actors . great great movie as well . love the movie and watch it from time to time .
although unrealistic , it was interesting . i enjoyed these series . i have n't seen these movies for years but i am glad i brought them . i would recommend you watch these movies .
great cast and great acting in a long movie you dont want to end . i recommend this one for your dvd library .
got some good laughs out of this season , you should buy it if you like the series also came here on time and in good shape
i like the movie i found it to be good , something to think about if you are married , see the movie
this dvd is amazing . both from a technical point of view and for it 's content . and i 'm usually a harsh critic ...
these are two great disney classics that can be shown any time of the year , but are particularly fun to watch around halloween .
the stories were interesting , the way things came together was a surprise , and the actors were great . it 's a nice movie to watch when you just want to kick back and relax . recommended .
they played well on my dvr . the picture quality and the sound were good . it was so good to see them again . we were very pleased with the three movies for the price .
we really liked this movie , it was fun and entertaining , emma thompson does a fantastic job , as always ! great family fun , i would recommend it to anyone .
this film has great writing and one need not see the original series to enjoy it . this film is a must for the horror fan . highly entertaining and a true gem among so many bad animated features .
it was n't very good . the good part was thanks to prime i watched it for free . i would pass on it .
i will always watch will ferrell movies ! this one cracks me up . seen it before and would watch it again for sure !
i was excited to watch that because in old days there were no closed captioned or english subtitles back then .
dark of the moon 3d is great ! this is why i purchased a 3d tv for action films that make you feel like you are part of the action ... .
dude , this movie rocks ! awesome acting , totally cool . it has meaning too , you know like it matters a lot and stuff .
we love tim allen when he plays in these good family movies . this is a good family movie , fun for everyone .
great laughs here and there . not quite as funny as i 'd thought it would be .
i always love gene hackman and i loved him in the french connection movies . i enjoyed the first one just a little more than the second one , though .
i absolutely love this movie . great story and great acting . the story and characters give insight into such an interesting culture and history .
there are 2 discs , and the movie just continues , must have a made for tv special otherwise , why 2 discs ? overall i think it was good , but a bit drawn out .
love both of the actors in this movie . it so funny at times and loving the next . enjoyed watching this movie very much .
there are 50 movies , we have seen a few , so far we like what we have seen . hope to see more as time goes by .

everyone loves the minions , and the story was pretty good . the blu ray looks great ! and the extras are funny .
so much fun to watch this show again and seeing jack in action never gets old ! so many twists and turns love it !
this is the cutest show and very hard to get . my sons watched it when they were young , now my daughter gets to see it too , thank you .
i watch this every christmas . it is hilarious . more of an adult christmas movie , kids will not get some of the humor . especially between the parents .
i love this this disney mickey mouse classic ! now if only amazon will allow us to purchase it for our prime video library !
a great movie to have on hand at christmas time to keep the kids busy . acting was good , plot was typical . not going to win any awards but enjoyable to watch .
i like history but found this movie boring . the acting was ok and the period costumes were very good . but find a good book about lincoln , buy and read it will be money better spent .
super funny ! ! i really enjoyed the movie and would recommend purchasing the dvd to anyone regardless of their age or education .
this is an enchanting movie -- good versus evil . it is well cast and very entertaining . several of the people that i work with also love it ! !
sequels usually do n't make the grade , but this one to me went beyond the original . so i would say that this is a once a month watcher .
great movie with a great cast ! one of the best movies for the season . cary grant is wonderful as the angel . '
i love the actors and , after reading some of the reviews , i wanted to see this film . i was , however , disappointed . it did not hold my interest and found the movie boring .
love and romance with a touch of humor is a delightful way to spend a couple of hours viewing with someone you love .
loved it , very difficult to watch because of the emotion , but judi dench was magnificent . overall very good movie , no violence , no dirty language , no guns , wow , nice to see ... ..
i watched this show as a kid and i liked it then and still do now it was ahead of it 's time

always loved this movie . jennifer lopez does a great job and makes this movie believable . plenty of action and a must for old movie buffs .

it was funny , entertaining for the whole family and very sweet ! i am very excited to see despicable me 2 ! ! !
this was not one of my favorite paul newman movies but we stuck it out until the end . i 'd rather have seen him in something else !
fast paced action with beautiful visuals of an historic london . robert d is excellent with his side kick watson helping .
cute move i loved it , ca n't wait to see the sequel clean , no cursing and no violence , refreshing change of pace and i do n't have any kids , i watched it for me .
highly recommend this 80s slasher gem . decent suspense and good kill scenes . a great traditional slasher movie .

this has always been one of my favourite detective series and this package did not let me down , the packaging of this series is remarkable and very easy to use , recommended ... ... ...
it is hard to find movies that teach values and the whole family can enjoy . these movies are really good for that . my kids enjoy them , and so do i .
a really great period film . the entire cast did a superior job . the movie had class . what else can be said .
i now own the entire series and am just about through with season 4. if you love westerns this is a wonderful way to pass the time and the story lines are always about what is decent and fair .
good kids flick . my son loves it and it did n't make me want to scream which is always a bonus .
great movie . i have nothing really to say about it . if you like scary and strange , this is the movie for you .
the movie was purchased for a child . they loved it . i liked it . it was fun . it is easy to recommend .
harrison ford should have been a president ... he is great in this movie and could save the world ... .
any charlie brown fan will love this . i bought it for the christmas season and we enjoyed every minute of it . have a feeling we will watch it again long before next christmas !
it 's a classic ... funny , warm , touching and just enough science fiction ! if you have n't seen it in a while , get it and enjoy .
i have watched all 7 seasons of west wing . the writing is excellent and acting was wonderful . i enjoyed it the second time as much as i did when it was on tv the first time .
i was at first taken back with the new changes happening , but then that is how life goes ... . changes
amazing movie and was so excited when i was able to find this to add to my collection . it is a must have movie series .
this is one of the best movies of all time , it looks unbelievable in blu ray and was worth the money .
a family movie for the whole family and for all ages . . . . . . . . . .
great movie for little girls and the whole family . family entertainment . watch together . have three tinker bell movies . love them all .
we 're avatar fans , what more can we say . great show to bad they stopped showing it on tv at least we can watch it on amazon .
i like doris day and james garner also and so i was somewhat disappointed that it was not a much funnier movie

it was recommended to me to get this movie and i am glad that i did it is just a great movie , i recommed it to everyone to watch
love this old football flick . i enjoyed watching this one to compare to the remake that adam sandler did . funny .
this film is entertaining ... excitement , adventure , intrigue . some parts could have been improved , but overall a good movie . worth watching . the ending is satisfying .
i have watched this movie at least 6 times . it is one of my all-time favorites . i would rate it # 4 on my all-time list .

the most addictive series i have ever watched . this series is so well done . the lighting , the camera shots , the story and the actors are all top notch . i recommend it .

good sequel to a good movie . very entertaining , lots of action and fun to watch .

these girls do ad great job and are fun to watch . it was fun seeing them in their younger years and the acting levels were at .
nice to see a baseball movie that a woman can enjoy . a good father and daughter relationship movie . good for the whole family .
young detective dee is best when you watch it in 3d . i purchased my copy of this blu-ray in december 2013 .
rented this on a rainy night not expecting much - i should have known better with that cast . bizarre story line , but funny movie .
it was really enjoyable , a bit predictable , but enjoyable . it gives me hope that i know someone is out there for me .
great for remake with 3d effects . if you are a fan of the original and have a 3d tv it 's one to buy .
i watched the series and enjoyed it very much . thought we would like to have it in blu ray dvd so we can watch it in full at some later date .
i must admit , delivery of my product was remarkable but the movie was not what i expected . i enjoyed the first half of the movie but the rest was crap .
not at all what i expected , it was even better . great way to spend a rainy afternoon . love the ending .
love this story watch it every year sometimes not at christmas time , makes a very nice gift for friends and family and easy to order for amazon .
wow , truly an amazing story . though there were horrific times , the writer was able to share some humor . the acting was great , especially by the children .
like this movie the story the actors and the plot , i am glad to have it whenever i want to see it without having it in hand
another gold classic with beautifully restored cartoons from the middle of the past century . they never stop amusing generation after generation .
i wo n't spoil plot or ending , but must say this was very enjoyable and had a great plot twist half way through it .
interesting but convoluted story line . buy it if you are wolverine and jackman fan . it has plenty of action but it is x-men meets samurai .
not my most favorite peanuts movie but one i have enjoyed watching with my son who has taken a liking to the peanuts movies . glad to have it in our collection .
this was one of my top 3 movies growing up so when i saw this on sale for blu ray , i had to get it , love this movie .
it is n't exactly like the books , but close . some details have changed but i felt they were good changes . i really love the series and i appreciate how they put it into movie form .
its dragon ball z ... they all are great and i highly recommend them to everyone , no matter what age they maybe .
i simply love cosby ! all the shows he has ever made were clean cut , family oriented with excellent morals ! too bad we do n't have those kind of shows today ! cosby is the best !
i bought this for the classic shorts that i grew up with , it is amazing to see how far we have come in filming .
it was a good sunday afternoon movie , reminds me of a flash gordon movie .
charlie brown is a must have for the holidays . we had it on vhs , so it was time to get it on dvd .
i thought this was pretty eerie and spooky until the last 20 minutes or so . then the plot changed some and disappointed me a bit . overall a decent thriller .
... you do n't find tv series like this any more , if you are a perry mason fan this season 2 is a must have ...
vince vaughn is such a good actor , but i do n't understand why he never does movies of a higher quality . the movie is ok , but he could do much better !
awesome funny movie , i have n't seen a funny movie in a long time and this one was the greatest ... . you have to get this for your collection ... ..
great movie , full of action . very entertaining ! nice to see a female action star for a change , as it does n't happen often ; at least not in a decent movie .
one of the best movies i have ever watched and it will keep you laughing for hours on end and the actors are the best at being the original stooges
this is season 2. i have season 1 and 3 they are all good . i am waiting on season 4. when it comes out i will purchase it .
great to start a james bond collection if you like any james bond movies you will most likely enjoy all of the classics as well .
i love this movie , good story , solid pace . it 's a bit long , but i 've seen it about 10 times , and it 's still not getting old .
my sister and i grew up watching these horror flicks . it was a great buy for the last christmas . thanks so much !
very well done series all the way through . have completely enjoyed the entire series
was n't the greatest wrestling dvd but definitely not the worst . would watch this again so it was n't a waste of money .
as i recall this was a really good show , it did n't last as long as i thought it should . i bought this for someone who really loved it and wanted the series .
im a huge fan of the twilight zone . all the episodes are wonderful . i look forward to it shown on tv
i was wondering where the story was going and it ended with a different story line that i did not expect .
always pleased with this seller . will continue to use this seller . product is always in better condition than stated .
good casting , good classic sci-fi storylines . wonder woman is a good role model for young girls . this season was the best of the three seasons .
this movie was much better than i expected ! better writing , delivery , effects , you name it , it was better . my favorite batman of all .
the characters have depth and humor . the plots are mysterious to the end . the setting is delightful . we were sorry to have finished season 4. masterpiece theater is top quality entertainment !
these are my favorite ben stiller movies to date , great clean fun for the entire family . i laugh every time
it picked up naturally from the end of season one , and advanced the continuing theme of the show in an entertaining fashion .
you have to watch this movie twice to understand it clearly . it 's up there with the matrix and very eye opening
this move is fanatic because it talks about the boys who were amazing of there talent and space race era .
great cast and even better writing . this show is not you average tv show ! try it - you 'll like it !
had to return it , meant to buy the blu-ray version . i 'm sure the dvd copy would be fine , if you do n't own a blu-ray player .
it 's not bad , if you can follow it . i could n't understand them most of the time . i like irish accent but that was to much . to slow for me .
it has a very strong cast and the screenplay is written well . the plot keeps you on the edge of your sit
have to say and many agree , this has to be one of the greatest stories and best martial arts action sequences ever !
it was from the start to the finish . it almost felt like real life action that a person can face . i would recommend this to all my friends .
bought this for my son , have other seasons and am trying to collect them all . was as described , a good price and came in a timely fashion .
this documentary was very well written and manages to keep the attention of the viewer . it is long , but very interesting and enlightening . for anyone who enjoys a little science !
i missed the beginning episodes of the show and was finally able to see what happened to the characters and how they all became friends .
great movie and it came early . i am a scifi nut job and needed this to round out my collections !
love wes anderson . i 've seen all his movies so far . this is his first movie , and definitely not his best . still a good movie . can see him developing his anderson feel .
these two movies are both great family movies , and i have enjoyed them both a number of times . great service was provided for my order and i am completely satisfied with the quality of the movie .
great movie one that stands the test of time . family friendly and funny . much better than anything that i have seen lately
i was expecting more . i am disappointed in this production . did not seem to be well written . it is not a high quality production .
that i had to spend very little to get it . i love the prime videos . it will alway be there when i want to watch it .
great special effects . plot is from the early series but presented with a more adult theme . entertaining for all . a definite must see before watching later seasons .
i am a big dexter fan and absolutely love this season , definitly worth buying and watching . i watch it while i work out and my workouts definitly fly by with this show !
this movie is a great movie . i enjoyed it a lot . i like the way the story goes . it is funny all the way through .
not really much to say other than i watch many of the episodes on cable . i just wanted to have the dvd on hand just in case i wanted to watch a certain show .
i really like that movie , its a really good movie that i could watch over and over again ... . its true ! ! ! !
while not as good as the original , still good enough to be worth watching . if you liked the first one , you will enjoy this one as well .
i wanted the entire set of the harry potter dvd 's and my kids and i really have enjoyed watching them .
still scary ... great addition for collectors of this series and the blu-ray tech is just amazing . the special effects are flawless and the performances are top-notch !
the dvd arrived in great condition and came to me in the time frame suggested . now the family can enjoy it .
i do n't want to give anything away , since the discovery is part of the fun . all i can say is - what a treat !
it 's a love story with kung fu , which is the only kind of love story a person like me would sit in front of the television to watch for longer than ten minutes .
excellent ! the brits know how to do horror and comedy so very well .
it was funny but dumb it 's so stupid i did n't watch the end and still have n't , my friend loved it but he 's goofy anyway .
why was the sister and brother crazy ? kind of stupid the way they were . i do not recommend anyone to rent or buy this movie .
it 's a fun little mystery for children or adults who like a little mystery . i enjoyed it but based on the previews i had expected more .
nicely done , who could go wrong with william powell ? a nice addition to my library
i love these two ! ! when i see them i know whatever it is it 's gon na ' be hilarious !
one of the best shows on tv . cant wait till the next episodes come out for season 5. just watch the show and you 'll see what im talking about .
it arrived quickly . i 'm hoping the person i got it for will love it come christmas day ... looks like a good movie .
purchased as a gift for my granddaughter . she is very pleased with this . a good gift for a child would recommend to other parents .
this is the best film out of the scrooge movies ( in my opinion ) . if you like & # 34 ; a christmas carol & # 34 ; then go ahead and buy this !
excellent blu ray disc . the movie itself is outstanding ! ! ! if you have a blu ray player , this movie is worth adding to your collection .
i finally watched this and i have always liked tom selleck . i found it very humorous at time and very touching at times .
this was pretty fun to watch and kept me guessing . the actors all did great and the tricks were fun and sometimes funny to watch .
fast delivery came new as advertised . i love bruce willis , this was a fun film to watch , lots of action and comedy lines .
this is a good movie for young ones . children who enjoy dinosaurs should enjoy little foot and more of his adventures .
i loved this series and the characters are very good and interesting to watch and & # 34 ; get to know & # 34 ; the mysteries are really good .
this was the season of glee that sold me on the show , and still is . i 'm so happy that it came at a decent price .
loved the different birds and the knowledge there was . the background on where all these were taken was put together in a way that anyone could understand .
the story line is a bit weak but the actors kinda save the film . witherspoon is ( as usual ) pretty much right on .
i really like listening to his comedic skits . i am glad to find it here , since it was n't available on dvd in my area too long . thank you , its great !
it was such a good buy for one movies much less ten movies . it was a pleasant surprise to get ten movies for this price .
great movie but a little slow . but by the end of the movie i did n't care it was slow anymore . would recommend this movie
for any one who liked frank sinatra , this is the perfect dvd to own . bought it for my husband for christmas , as he is a big frank fan . he loves it .
got this nicely packaged hitchcock collection and have been taken to a world of masterful suspense , thrills , twists in a class of its own , and will stand its test of time . great collection to have
we love this show and the whole series . so sorry to see it end . great dynamic between lewis and hathaway .
it was ok , i probably would have not bought it if i seen it in the movies . it was filmed very dark and hard to see . i liked the first one better .
these movie classics was a christmas gift ... for my grandkids but was loved b enjoyable they are movies that will be watched all year round ...
my son loves this show . i think it is age appropriate with out being too violent and it is entertaining for my husband as well .
this is another good movie . i know have the first one and the second one the are both really good .
i have most of the dvd 's on the bible series , and this one is probably one of the best of the whole lot .
we saw this movie on cable tv and loved it . we had to order the dvd . it has a great message and is very inspirational .
my first time to see justified and immediately got hooked on it . great series and highly recommend it . not a big tv watcher but sorry i missed this series . will definitely follow now .
this is an excellent start to a great classic series . i would recommend this show to any new generation sitcom lover . you wo n't find a great show like this anymore
this was a low budget movie & i did n't think i would like it , but i have to say i really enjoyed the movie & for the price you just ca n't beat it !
this is a very well done period movie , one might even say a costume play , and depicts a strong woman in a difficult period for women . would watch again .
ed norton is amazing in this film . the story 's unusual . some parts go too far for my taste ... but otherwise good .
this movie is a great thrill ride . i had never seen it before and i did n't know what to expect and i was not disappointed . very entertaining
love it because of the acting as well as the story . unpredictable and exciting and a very sweet story . thanks !
love all the heroes working together . they are awesome heroes . i would recommend this to anyone who loves super hero movies .
i love the super hero movies and this was very well done . good story line and great action . a bit slow at times , but helped to move the story along .
great movie . the queen is totally scary . kristen stewart did a wonderful job . came on time and in perfect condition .
what a cool movie and i hope that there will be a sequel . i just love the batman movies and it 's added to my collection . thanks again !
i bought this for my grandchildren . they really enjoyed it . what a cute movie for children to watch . i highly recommend it !
again this series is just to great . if you have never seen one , just start with the first and you will be hooked for life
as always lucille ball was the queen of comedy and such fun watching the old shows again . no matter how many times these shows are watched they still make you laugh .
great great movie it is a must see i got both parts and ca n't wait for the third to come out .
a great story , we really enjoyed it tremendously . i ca n't believe we did n't hear more about this movie when it was in theatres .
i liked this series better the first few seasons . it has become too predictable . it 's still better than most of what is on tv these days , though .
the first and second seasons were pretty good , it kept me wanting to see more . the third season is just bad . i could n't get past the second show .
i am really enjoying this series , the characters and their roles are great . i would like more details just for my own curiosity . but over all i would recommend it .
i loved this movie ... it was so true i do the same exact things being a teenage drama queen myself
an excellent account of the tragic events in new york city . this should be a must see for everyone so that we do not forget .
another matt damon scary look at the possibilities of the real nature of our world . i enjoyed this movie very much .
continuing on with mysteries . really do n't have to them in any order . recommend the whole series .
my granddaughter only knows the current power rangers , so although she watched it , i do n't know that she was all that excited about it .
what can you say about a classic dvd . it 's a great addition to my collection .
i bought this as a gift for a fellow baseball lover , but may eventually end up having to buy another copy for myself .
what an awesome drama . see it if you have time ! i do n't normally watch drama films , but this was extremely worth it !
my grandson 's liked it , it was good light entertainment that went good with popcorn . the movie was what it was , just fun .
the subject matter was hard to watch at times but it was based on true events . you just realize how much is political in the real world when you watch a show such as this one .
such a great disney classic . i grew up with this movie and now my 2 daughters love it ! who does n't love a wonderful disney movie ? !
very good superhero movie with a good balance of dialogue and action . rare movie that 's a good watch for kids and adults .
well made and very entertaining . it lived up to the hype but was n't quite what i would call unforgettable . but it was very good .
i absolutely love lucy . & # 34 ; i love lucy & # 34 ; is the most entertaining and enjoyable tv show ever created . love the show and i will be purchasing ever season .
this completed my set of this series . steve mcqueen is one of my favorite western actors . this is a great series . i watch them over and over .
two delightful films about what america should be all about and is not . fun and very well acted with people we have enjoyed over the years .
a christmas gift for someone who loved this movie as a child . it arrived quickly and in perfect condition . definitely worth getting this movie to make someone very happy on christmas morning .
errol flynn is one of my favorite actors . i have n't found a movie i did not like him in . i would recommend this dvd to anyone .
jeff dunham is hilarious and offers up a new special which i can easily recommend and is great to see during the halloween season !
i hate it , but my friend loves it . i got all 7 seasons for him as a christmas gift . it was very expensive . should have been sold as a set .
this was one of the funniest movies i have seen in a was while we watch this over and over and over . our kids love this movie
i really enjoyed the film . the story of the beginning of the adventure is the best experience . i would definetly recommend this product to friends and family .
no comment , no comment , no comment , no comment ... .i just do n't have anything nice to say . maybe it 's my age or ... no comment .
i ca n't believe how fast it came to my home . the dvd is wonderful and great price in the stores it would be more money .
sad to see the series end so soon . i believe there is more to tell about the lives of the people .
had never seen before and they 're extremely well done but not my favorite . will probably grow on me though . great in blu-ray format .
i bought this movie without any clue as to what the movie was about . it was very affordable and i just went for it . the movie is actually a different kind of contemporary love story .
great movie , very funny , would recommend to anyone that enjoys gay flicks with out quite as much sex , although porn is great too .
this is not a fast moving , action packed movie . it 's closer to a thinking piece , but i liked it very much .
this one is a classic . we like having the blu-ray / dvd combo to be able to use the blu-ray at home and take the dvd with us on trips .
amazing movies ! especially the original three . the most recent one is kinda lame , but it 's still indiana jones ! ca n't wait to see in on blu-ray .
this movie is fun for the whole family , adults will love the humor while kids will love the whole thing .
i truly enjoy watching this movie multiple times per year . lots of action with a mix of historical events . great stuff .
old favorite and the best in the trilogy . mib 2 is n't too bad either . did n't care much for mib 3 .
always enjoy john wayne movies . have n't been disappointed yet . wish the movie was in color . always love his war movies .
omg ! i love love love this dvd series ! ! ! ! i watched it twice on tv already and i had to buy the set to own !
each one of the characters is perfect . the humor is so far out , and unpredictable . i enjoy every episode i watch .
something to watch and make you think . starts off slow , but then slowly draws you in . made for an enjoyable evening .
if you are a fan of the books , the movies are just as good . if you are a fan of tom selleck than this is a must for all fans .
because it is a funny movie . bette midler and danny devito are hilarious . i love them both and together they 're amazing .
this sitcom is so funny ! everything about this whole series is funny ! i would tell everybody to get this sitcom ! plus it came in excellent condition and came extra quick !
a crap movie , one of those movies were the 60 second preview , is the best part of the movie , very disapointed with this dvd , as they say never judge a book by the cover
not really a feel good movie but we really enjoyed it . denzel is amazing and it 's well directed . it makes you wonder about the pilot industry !
typical bruce willis action . it was fun with his wise guy humor but some of the stunts were over the top .
i saw this on the history channel and was so excited i could purchase it so others could see it .
how can you go wrong with the duke ? five great movies to choose from and enjoy . and enjoy it you will .
a riveting and thinking film of if this ever were really to happen . i found it keeping me to my seat and on my toes
i watched this movie as a kid . the classic comic character turned to a movie . the action you remember . 2 thumbs up .
we saw this on tv and i just had to own it , have never laughed so hard in a long time .
timothy olyphant need i say more . i could watch him in anything . he is a very under rated actor . i love him in justified and even when he plays a bad guy .
great series . i 'm glad this is coming back on air , i think on netflix . you ca n't go wrong watching this .
my twin kids love this story . they ask us to show them this dvd all the time . for me , as an adult , it 's a typical disney story .
just got this for xmas , love the film , but this is definitely not high resolution ! if i had bought it i 'd be returning it .
love the first season . helps really set the tone for the coming years of this generally well written show . rent it .
but i really liked this movie ... ... .i have also shared it with some friends and they liked it . it may not be totally like the play but it is still a worth while film .
this is a great movie . if you love dogs it 's also a great movie . if you like movies that make you feel good when you are done watching them then buy this movie .
great , great movie . it will make you see things in a whole new way . get it today .
could n't wait for this to be released and have no regrets whatsoever ! ! ! its fun and it works ! ! got both videos together and hope there are more to come ! ! !
these are great charlie chan movies . may be the best set for the money . decent sets and the usual chan comedy .
for fans of the show this is a great beginning . fun and with the added mystery and historic facts makes for a great show
this is a great movie . we love the actors in the movie . we have all 5 movies . i would recommend this to others .
this is a fun adventure i did n't like the last movie but the rest of them make it worth it i 'm really happy with the set
great movie real funny and different . if you are into crude comedy you will like this movie if not then probably not the one for you . worth watching for sure .
better than i thought it would be for a classic film . great entertainment . acting was awesome , great purchase for the money .
excellent show . good script keeps your attention . would highly recommend looking forward to next seasons show this show never disappoints you
this is such a funny movie ! i love jim carrey . i got an awsome movie for an awsome price and it shipped quick !
loved all these movies and it was a hit with my son ! hope to see another one come out also .
i was looking forward to seeing this , but after seeing the trailer , i felt like the show was given away .
liam neeson is awesome but the movie is dark and depressing . not a great way to spend a saturday afternoon . fairly predictable . wo n't watch it again or recommend it .
they spent a lot of time developing the story line at the start ... how clark got to earth . well done .
this is a very interesting and educational watch that is under appreciated . also , great acting and writing that makes you attached to the characters .
this is a great movie in leonardo dicaprio fashion ! it is not a family movie by any means , but despite the length a good watch .
if you like adventures and sci-fi you will love this series ! i am hooked ! i am looking forward to buying the rest of the series !
funny , funny , funny , and more funny . the music was great and the acting was good . a good tyler perry play . if you like tyler perry plays you would love this one .
by the 3rd or 4th season , home improvement had come into its own . the 5th season is excellent . any fan of the show will need to add this one to their collection .
exactly what was advertised . great fun for the entire family . for us it was replacing old vhs tapes to complete our christmas movie collection
this series was very enjoyable and the mix of comedy and action come off very well . i 'll be purchasing further episodes as i will enjoy watching them over again .
had to buy the trilogy , but did n't expect them to make more , but will buy them also ... the special effects is very well done .
my husband and i love this series ! the episodes are well written , keep your interest , and the acting is wonderful ! do n't miss it !
it awesome and show what you can do if you put your mind to it and i think kid and adult would like it and it was a awesome movie to me
i do n't really understand all the hype about this movie- it 's mediocre at best . there are lots of better animated films out there .
this was a great movie , so was thrilled to get it at a great price and to receive it so quickly
i really liked this one because it was the first in the series and deserved to be to be the first .
what woman does n't like sean connery . since 007 he 's been on my favorites list . i love to see him and hear him .
excellent show with good writing . the characters are complex . it is fun to watch and see where the story line is going .
what a wonderful show - i am so happy i got this dvd , ca n't stop watching it , thoroughly loving it .
this special edition of the dvd arrived in good condition . the movie is not quite the same as i remembered it to be , though . animation quality has greatly advanced since the 1950s .
sandra and ryan have a great chemistry . this is one of those movies ii can watch over and over . betty white steals every scene she 's in ! love it .
what can i say but i love this movie ... the songs and the people in it are a ten in my book ...
this movie , although subtitled was very funny a well made movie a love story for all to enjoy ... everyone has some kind of fear
elvis movies are always great fun ! this was purchased as a gift and they loved it ! take a chance and find out why !
this is one of my all time favorite movies now . it 's got everything i like ; comedy , drama , romance , adventure , and music ... i absolutely love this film !
another fantastic performance from denzel ! very human . one of his best since training day . definitely worth a watch , if not purchase .
i have the complete collection and this was the last part i purchased . it is a must have for your compilation .
all i can say is ( funny ) ( funny ) and ( funny )
i have purchased all of the videos in this series . i highly recommend them . my daughter loves them and she has learned so much from them also . she ask to watch them over and over .
i enjoyed both movies and each had things that made for a good family film .
i like animation . i especially like a good story . this one was fun and had a good story . i liked it .
my two and five year old liked this movie ok but they did n't stay glued to it the first time . they did what it twice after that time .
i took my children to see it at the movies and we all enjoyed it very much . it is a good movie with a good storyline that kids can learn from .
a great movie for younger kids . i like to have movies on hand for children . this was a delightful movie .
what a pleasant , well acted , cute plot movie . it 's an `` oldie '' but `` goodie '' and all should enjoy it .
this movie actually made me cry a little at the end . i thought this was funny & a little heartwarming at times . i liked this movie .
nothing really can top the original inspector morse series but this comes very close . i enjoyed this season and it 's definitely worth buying !
i watch a lot of movies and like to collect all the worth while ones . these are a must to have and arrived on time and in great condition
still loved it when i was younger at movies still love it as an adult ... . must be the chicago side in me ...
love this dvd series very much . many extras for each season . if you are a fan of doc martin , this collection series is for you !
the space parts were corny , but take those out and you 've got a great james bond flick .
its a shame that this show ended after just a single season . i would have liked to see it continued .
how do you not love this movie ? i got this for my grandson who loves all things disney . he watched the last one so much it wore out the disc !
we love this jerry lewis video . it is done really well and is a great story . loved it as a child and had been looking for awhile to find it in the usa dvd zone .
the ending left you hanging - but i do n't see anymore seasons . i guess they figure they might come back .
bought this for a friend so he could see the first season and why i got hooked . love this series and so sad it 's done next year .
i thought the premise was good and would make a great movie . the premise was good but the movie took a strange direction . it ended ok but could have been so much better .
this is a great movie that 's based on a true story . if you are into sports films , you need this one .
this was a good movie . blu ray makes it some better but not worth the extra cost . stay with your regular movie on this one .
it was such a shame no body did anything about this at the time . a dark time in our recent history for sure . get it and watch it .
i love the supernatural series and was absolutely thrilled to find the entire fourth season here at a much cheaper rate than i could find in most stores .
w did not enjoy this and turned it off half way through . save your money since this is a real stinker !
monk is one of my favorite shows . even though it 's on netflix , i still wanted to buy the dvds so i am collecting them .
as always a good go to when i want a change in my workout . easy to follow and still work up a sweat .
it was alright , not what i would consider on of denzel washington 's best movies ( plot ) , but as his skills as an actor were very good .
this movie is really funny . this movie is good as a date movie . the story is really funny . actors did amazing job .
finally a series you can watch without sex and violence ! a witty detective series that you will watch over and over , and like a good book you just ca n't put down , frost delivers !
arnold hits it this time i think it is 5 stars and this is the kind of movie i watch over and over . great addition to our movie collection .
standard cop drama with some stiff acting , in parts , what keeps the movie unique is its 40 years old and still has the best car chase scene ever filmed
part two of a cool as hell funny movie ! this movie rocks ! you have to have this movie in your collection ! buy it people !
great movie collection these movies are very good thumbs up for eastwood really ca n't say much more then all the other reviews have already said .
good movie prequel to the lord of the rings trilogy . good blend of computer generated graphics and actual background visual effects . nice adaption from the book .
best example of the westerns and their characters that i grew up with . so many familiar faces and knowing it was wayne 's last .
wonderful show , great content , perfect for a new fan or a hardcore collector ! a must have for any adventure time fan . highly recommended .
the only bad thing about this british tv series was that it ended . great acting , great everything . another winner , that 's for sure .
with the cast that it featured i expected more . overall was boring and predictable . a few funny moments but overall a disappointment .
if you like british comedies , this set of holiday shows is for you . this collection has some of the best british comedies and it makes you want to see more of them .
great movie . slow beginning but very engaging . good science fiction . would recommend to anyone that likes science fiction .. : o )
this movie was funny , but now as funny as the first film . this one was a bit more crude and just crazy .
colin and jamie are a great duo . you have action , hot guys , comedy ... everything a movie needs and this movie has it .
i say this movie and it keep you watching . it a old movie but it good . my dad had this movie and i saw him watch this back then . so i got it for my self .
i love this movie . i seen this movie once , but with commercials loaded in the movie . so , i decided to purchase the movie to see it in full length
not exactly what i was looking for but not entirely a dud . a 70 's era action series set in london . good acting but not a lot of action . slow moving .
this is a perfect movie for all of the family will be one of my regular christmas movies in the future
anthony hopkins makes this film though the other actors were very good . it 's an interesting story shot in a beautiful location . i would recommend it to most people .
i would definitely purchase this item again and recommend it to others . terrific family movie and sweet story . love it
i watched it for about 15 minutes and quit . it is not my kind of movie.i hate the fact that amazon makes me waste my time with these required fields . this product was not worth my time .
if you liked the previous american pie movies , you will like this one as well . it has about the same cast of characters with some new twists .
compared to other shows , i would have given this five stars . but not as good as some of dexter 's previous seasons . still thrilling !
really good series . i see it was directed by tom hanks and stephen spielberg . worth watching . wish they would have made a few more .
great season . i do n't want to spoil it for everyone , but it was a great follow up to the 4th season .
this is an all time classic movie and a particular favourite that we really enjoy watching so very much . awesome .
pretty good story line and having the characters thoughts known to us helps make the plot believable . the guys are hot too and it is cool how they finally hook up .
we love midsomer murders ( set 17 ) . my husband and i are big fans of this show . we have all their dvds . very enjoyable to watch .
best movie ever ! ! ! one we watch every year around christmas time , who does n't love this movie ? no complaints buy it !
high crimes was a very good thrill movie you really did not no his guilty to almost the end and ashley judd is a very good actress she just doesnt have a lot of movies
a great movie that has clever lines , interesting characters , and a good plot . julia roberts and hugh grant have a chemistry that is delightful to watch .
good movie something different , had sort of that men in black style of action , worth watching good action stunts and comedy as well
this was a movie i remember from along time ago and im happy i was able to find it here
i purchased this items as a gift . the price was really great . it was shipped on time and i would buy more items in the future .
i have really enjoy the series and i am glad to own it in my collection . get it or rent
the video was happy and sad , and just right for me . the video is on my top self and now is my favorite video .
this was the greatest show to enjoy . i hope the actors and writers realize how much joy they gave to the world with this show .
great movie with great sound and visuals . what it on a hd tv and get blown away
i 'm so happy to find this series is available and i 'm planning on adding all of them to my tv collection .
this is a fun movie , lots of enjoyable characters , and a joy to watch ! some good historical characters in the movie , that give an opportunity for lessons on the spot ! !
it showed how families take care and understand each other . it also shows how age changes everyone . we really do not know each other we only think we do
the acting , scenery and basic story line are great . however , the characters are shallow . this viewer has the impression that the book must be better .
but i watched it anyway . i hope there really are n't little tiny kids who have to live like that . it made me sad
i love this movie i have watched it about 12 times and would love to watch it again and again
i love bones and this is a great season in particular . the only issue i had with it was the price . it 's rather expensive for a series with only 13 episodes !
scooby-doo : i bought scooby doo for my grandson he love to watch him and the things he gets in to .
it is easy to understand . we had a lot of fun watching it . and there lots of episodes to pick from . i recommend it .
great job done by all the featured actors in a very interesting and unusual story . animal lovers , in particular , should enjoy this one .
this is a very funny movie . i cant wait till the dvd comes out . if you havent seen it do and you will be laughing the whole way through
i enjoyed frank 's story and the telling of his transformation . it does feel like a lot is left out between his final outcome and the end of the documentary . still , it is an inspiring watch .
this is much different than most of the teenage anime . likely not too good for small kids . each of the episodes are good .
i 'm not sure why anyone who watch this movie . with all the big name actors i thought it would me awesome . boring !
once again , i am a big tyler perry fan , and this play was great . i actually liked the play than the movie !
ok movie , a little slow in place even though i am a huge lotr fan . the 3d was also only ok , wish i could say it was great .
i started watching this but did n't have enough time to finish it . i think tyler perry is very funny . i will finish it soon .
i received the dvd pretty fast . i really enjoyed watching it , played really well . it brought back memories from when i was a young kid growing up watching the hulk .
perfect christmas movie . what a great story that we can all relate to at one time . who does n't dream of skipping christmas ?
do n't listen to critics . what do they know ? i know this is an awesome sci-fi adventure ! that 's what i know . if you want some serious fun ... buy this movie !
very predictable and too much computer generation . weak story and too much tom cruise . the middle of the movie was just dull .
this was such a treat ! have n't seen since i was a little girl , but still wonderful ! will be sharing with another generation of viewers when the grandchildren come for a visit .
amazing stories of a family and it 's amazing home . you wo n't be able to stop watching this drama ! wonderful dramatic performances .
great season ! they got all the episodes and special features only only three discs . good quality packaging . the big bang theory is great !
my daughter loves this movie , and has since she was little . i bought it as a surprise gift for her , and she loves it and thinks it 's even better in bluray .
a total junk and waste of time nonsense . not recommended . thank god for the fast forward feature . it was obvious from the beginning this would be a disaster and it was .
i bought this dvd because george c. scott starred in it . the rendition is a cut above many other productions of the story because the acting is quite good .
i saw this movie years ago and it is still one of my favorite . every once in a while i have a desire to see it again and again .
i would have to say i just started watching this season and i completely enjoy the plots , the turns and everything in between great series to watch i ca n't wait to see season two .
once again , the team working on this brilliant series continues telling the tales of the dark knight and the trials he must face to protect his beloved city !
this was a pretty cute picture . not as cute as i would have liked . turns out alright in the end .
i enjoyed dark crimes 50 movie pack it had a lot of movies i never seen before and most likely never will be on tv .
great classic movie , i never seen it at all in the 80 's , the first time i saw is on cable and i decided to buy it !
great acting , great movie . there was a lot of suspense here and it kept me guessing all the way to the end .
i seen it before and it was funny i said i wanted to see it again well i got the movie and it was funny
this is a really good movie , you have to pay attention and stay in the room the whole movie ... or pause it if you have you leave the room ...
i have been looking for this tv series on dvd for a while . i saw it i bought it am very happy
full house is a great family show this is a great season so if you feel nostalgic when you hear the theme get this set .
this is a great movie ! i would recommend this purchase . my son loves this movie ! this is a funny movie and has a great story .
i first saw this one on pbs many years ago . my wife did n't . we really enjoy this one .
my wife and i enjoy the family friendly show . brings back great memories of what america was and could be again .
it arrived on time and i enjoyed it from the very first minute forward . very glad that i decided to purchase .
a real winner ! cary grant lovers will adore this one . his comedic ability shines ! for a rainy day of lighthearted movies , this is a must have .
this is the best copy so far ! please , , , strong script , great acting , and a great close . cary grant is incredible . keep these classics coming .
this australian movie is full of action , but the superb are the 3d format , make live it every second of the movie , recommended
i was happy to see that the story line of the priest falling in love being carried out to the end .
somewhat entertaining but also rather boring and too fast , too short etc ... however , is also nice because the stories are nice and well portrayed ...
simply well done . worth the money . i recommend this set of discs to anyone . beautifully photographed and produced . great job .
another example of a large cast of stars not making a good movie . only got about 15 mins into the movie , before i could n't stand it any longer .
could not wait to get this blu-ray , i am very happy with this purchase , great sound , i also purchased the cd
this movie is good , entertaining , and funny . with a good storyline and worthy acting make this one a winner ... barely .
i thought this would be a good movie from what i saw on tv . but it was not good at all : (
this show was ok but they are nothing like the originals as i feel these are more scary for kids . have put it away for a few more years until they get older .
my grandson wanted it , i have a copy which he has almost wore out , now he has his own great family movie
i saw this as a teenager and have always loved it . what a beautiful story of love and loss . it helps you remember how short life is and how important the little things are .
this movie was good but a little slow for my liking . the drama was interesting and drug out . would watch more like this one .
he is so funny ; watch it without small children around due to language but you will definitely laugh and agree to many things said ; so worth the belly laughs you will get
old movie , funny movie and it was reasonably priced . could not get it via netflix , so 4 more words here .
i was hurt to see this show go . a must buy for fans of the show . superman will live on in my dvd player .
this item shipped fast ! i love this tv show , and it came and works great . it was even in the new packaging .
excellent movie , great performance from all the actors and what a story line ! i highly recommend this movie , especially if you love drama and suspense !
a great dvd , well done ! i have bought the whole set ! great feature to pick black & white or color viewing !
movie started off slow but built up to be pretty good . ca n't think of much more to say than that .
this picture was fantastic to say the least . this is easily one of denzel washington 's best performances of his entire career .
this was the third and last tarzan entry for mike henry . great family entertainment . again , great story and great family entertainment .
i love most of will smith work and movies and this movie is one of my favorites . the chemistry between will and gene is incredible . a must see movie
have not watched this dvd yet - but in terms of purchase , i was satisfied with the cost and was received in good order ! !
lame acting and the the same story again . it was too long for a very stupid ending . safe your money and pass on this one .
i have watched the whole story - box set 1 , box set 2 , and box set 3 many times when television was boring . i thoroughly enjoyed it .
i was amazed if how awesome this movie is . it has cool fight scenes and a great story . good for all ages . cool movie !
this movie was so bad i could only ( barely ) stomach the first 2 scenes . it is hard to believe they put money into this film only to destroy it with wooden dialogue and acting .
again , i can not say enough about the jesse stone series . it is great . good story , great actor , and wonderful scenes .
a terrific old movie for the entire family . it is a must have for any family dvd or movie collection . i especially love the old style feel of the production . brings me back ...
funny funny movie . eddie murphy is hilarious as well as the supporting cast . great picture quality and sound . definite addition to eddie murphy collection .
i have to admit i cut it off , i did not consider it worth my time , terrible . i am surprised i watched it as long as i did .
... that reminds me of the feeling i got when i did not want to look under my bed during the night as a child .
this movie is a fave of mine . the thing i love about it is that it looks so believable . it 's eerie but you never know why until the end .
it is a great , interesting movie . it has a little suspense . it ended great & sad at the same time . it shows how things is not always the way they seem .
love this classic christmas movie . i was n't impressed with the remake and wanted my friend to see the original . nothing can beat this classic .
packaging very well and the price was well for the item . love scooby doo and this was an excellent product .
not as good as i thought it would be but still pretty good . i was kind of waiting for it to be over .
this movie was horrible . so bad that it is the only movie i have ever been to that when it was over everyone in the theater started laughing at how bad it was .
this is one of my favorite movies and i do n't even remember it out in theatres . the concept is so funny and cute and reflects an appreciation of honesty and trust .
it 's a very well done movie with good action . the actors played the roles very well and kept everything very interesting .
this dvd brings back good childhood memories i loved this show when i was a kid watched it with my brother alot
the movie works and it does pause for a min or so but then it continues so therefore its ok
i have liked each movie in this series of movies . i would watch each addition to the series or all three of these over again .
very good for those who like sherlock holmes . the modern version really holds up well in comparison to other programs of this type
franco was not the best choice for this part . the special effects are good , but really the story is flat and not that interesting .
my son 's moved this movie and i wanted to have it for my grand children when they visit . i love the movie too .
what a classic adam sandler movie . this movie is hilarious and my dad actually likes it ( he is the worst critic ever ) .
i give it five stars as you really have to watch to the end bit slow but has it good points anyone would enjoy this
i love csi . it my favorite show i had to get it on dvd amazon was only place that had it for a good price so that 's why i gave it a five star
a great , timeless movie . i really enjoyed this as a kid and was glad to rewatch it with my niece .
this was a fun movie , not a great movie , or anything outstanding , but really a lot of fun ! i 'll watch it again myself .
quirky , funny movie . very creative with beautiful cinematography . story is very interesting . recommended !
buy this movie.it is so funny and the whole family will enjoy it and be rolling over with laughter . great for family night .
finally , a movie out there for girls too ! ! ' boys will enjoy also , but there are so many for them . adults will love too .
love murder , she wrote ... have watched all 12 seasons twice now and the movies are just as great !
excellent just dose not do justice to this movie . i was glued to the chair while the movie as playing
enjoyed the movie , all the characters were great , can see why it was nominated for so many awards ! it is worth the price .
good , but not great . did n't quite make the transition to such a modern setting .
this is one of the best fonda films that i have seen and it does not get the notice it deserves .
great movie to add to the the great books . it is good to have a complete collection of all the books and movies to compliment each other .
great episode . really good picture and sound . you will like it to . enjoy great picture and sound . great actors too .
you do not need to say more then madonna , she really knows how to put a concert together .
thank you so much for season 3 ! keep them coming ! we want the entire series !
this was a gift for someone and they said they liked it . i thought it was ok , but nothing special .
i love this movie , i really feel good about this dvd excellent i will be ordering more movies from you guys thank you much .
the picture was clear . the sound was great and there were no scratches . plus the story behind the movie was awesome .
he 's so totally awesome i buy his dvd 's because i enjoy them so much and i 'll watch them over and over without getting tired of them .
one the best anime films of all time . so happy its now on blu-ray . very time is see this movie have to watch & watch again .
a man is searching for his place with god . a high school football team learn all about god and what his place is in the game . very inspiring . get the tissues out .
bogart should have done more comedy , it really works in this movie . not over the top but extremely funny . well worth watching .
bought this movie for a friend who is a collector himself and know walter matthau it 's got to be funny - his dry humor is worse watching any movie of his
i have seen this movie many times enjoyed it each and every time it is an oldie but a goodie i like dragons and these are n't as cheesy as some i have seen
you ca n't go wrong with a subject like this ! god so loved the world that he gave his only son ! will view this in the near future ! thank you for having this movie !
i had no interest in this movie however my wife wanted it and loved it . she views it often when wants something light to view

if you love the alien movies this is a great collection to add to your movie collection . a must buy for fans .
all three of these movies was very good . it was kind of confusing but it all became to make since .
this a classic football movie . forget the remake this is the real deal ! the dvd has a great transfer and some cool extras .
nothing in the story was particularly interesting or even held together . as you can expect from a high budget us movie , the special effects were good . the acting was nothing much .
loved it but it made everyone cry and was not something for the children to watch , but there was a good lesson to learn .
my 7 & 9 year olds loved this movie - as did my wife and i. great story - nice animals . i strongly suggest this movie .
you can see so many things wrong with what we thought the future was going to be ... fun to watch
too much scifi the too different of the original which is a must to understand all the new versions of the movie .
gorgeous actress and you 'll be even more amazed when you watch the making of the movie .
great move and service . the movie was as i remembered it . great action and historically accurate i enjoyed it from start to finish .
only a good movie not the best a few good scenes with great action great acting by sandra bullock with unreal circumstances
i absolutely love this movie ( my favorite movie of all time ) and i recommend it to anyone . best actors in the world , best story in the world ! ca n't go wrong !
tom cruise was excellent in this . it was action packed and intriguing . there 's a bit to it so listening and watching everything helps to get it all . good flick .
best animated comedy series ever and one of the all-time best comedies period . i like the later seasons a little better than the earlier seasons , but i highly recommend them all !
wow wow wow my son and i are hook to this series and it gets better by the season . 100 % recommended
boring and fell asleep trying to understand what 's going on . someone else may find it better but it was n't for me
this is a show i enjoy watching . i bought volume one of season one , and plan to buy other volumes .
this is a great series , i enjoyed then and now . the characters are unique and the story line is very interesting . i recommend this series highly .
it had all the elements funny , drama , excitement and old people kicking a -- and taking names and doing great stunts what more can you ask for
i think this is my favorite season , this and the 1st and 3rd seasons are my favorite , you should buy it . worth it .
this is a fantastic movie that portrays the lives of 3 kennedy wives . each lady played their roles to perfection . how difficult it was to be a kennedy wife .

this was a wonderful singing movie . all the people in there with their musical talent going praise to god , moved me . loved it ! ! ! !

i thought this was a great addition to the franchise . i 'm also very happy that there are still two more movies to come in this latest trilogy .
i enjoyed the movie as it was an interesting story along with action . i like the actors and i am glad the same ones are still doing the story .
we bought this to add to the video library and it has been a pretty popular item since purchased . wolverine !

if ya like nicholas cage ... you 'll live this movie and especially the ending ! ! action filled with a twist you do not expect ? ?
i loved this movie when i was a child and now i can show it to my nieces & nephews and their children on dvd .
at first , this movie was hard to understand about what was going on but i stayed with it and when it was over i watched it again and it is a fascinating science fiction movie .
had this in vcr format and my daughter wanted the dvr for christmas . we love this movie . fun and lighthearted .
this movie is fantastic ! everything about it is well done ! the transformation scene is the most graphic ive ever seen ! give this awesome werewolf story a chance !
kinda sad ! i like it a lot ! wish it would have show the future a bit more ! great over all
character development is believable ... .the story line is sometimes too predictable but the actors did a wonderful job of working around the flaws in the script . i looked forward to all segments .
the actors in this show are excellent & their interaction is excellent . i would recommend this series to anyone that wants something different , action packed & great characters . again , you can not beat this cast .
seinfeld : season 7 is great family entertainment . the individual characters are unique and together they make life entertaining for everyone to watch !
i think i paid 12 dollars for this when i got it . what can you say about 2 of the greatest modern westerns based in history ? wonderful cinematography .
great classic ! clean , wholesome entertainment . most everyone takes time to watch this movie during the christmas season . i have always loved it .
a must have collection of movies if you just adore those great judy garland movies ! they are those movies you can watch over and over and get that feel-good feeling each time !
the only thing that makes this movie is how hot the girl is ; way to much language and drug use ( plus the fights are stupid ) i would not recommend this move
i 've always seen bits and pieces of this movie and finally rented it . definitely took me back to the time of my childhood memories during christmas time . good addition to your collection of christmas movies .
saw this advertised on tv and i love pretty much all of tyler perry 's plays , so i ordered this one .
fun movies . they still hold up over the years . it gives a feel for how innocent we were back then . blood and gore have become almost too much at times in the movies of today .
just a lot of old fashion t & a . a cheesy plot but brings back nostalgia of the 70 's . let your kids watch to see what mom and pop had to choose from when they were kids
i love this movie , it was so entertaining since the beginning of the movie and throughout , it 's a clean and funny movie , loved it !
got it . love it just like all the rest . not many shows that i can say that about after 8 seasons .
as for seasons 1 and 3 , i purchased used media and was very pleased with the quality and the value of the product .
meg and russel are always great . sorry it ended the way it did . but that is the way life is . but it had a good story line .
3 starts is probably more than it deserves , but it gets this rating because most everything else offered on amazon prime has even less redeeming value .
i laughed so hard i had a hard time catching my breath . if you love robin williams this is the movie for you .
what can one say about disney , it was a request from my daughter for christmas - ca n't wait to watch it with her . by the way she is 34 !
this is a very funny series and has some wonderful comedy . i really enjoy the watching this series and would recommend it
this is a gift ; the packaging is good , so i expect this will be an enjoyable movie for my friend whose birthday is in another month . he loves westerns .
i loved this so much that i bought all in the love series and enjoy watching them over and over again . great family movie .
this series is amazing and wonderful . we never miss an episode and we will watch this set over and over thru the winter . thank you for speedy delivery and great product ,
i enjoyed it , but in the end it does get a little long . good action with all the old guys we grew up with that were in movies we watched years ago .
this is a great movie , out of all the super hero movies to date i have to say that the avengers is top notch entertainment for all . buy this movie you wo n't be disappointed .
is one of my favorite show and good buy and a good sale would buy from again great to watch
you can tell that this was one of the great tv series simply by seeing how many seasons it was on .
i have the dvd already but i had to buy a new one cause i have a crack in it but it 's worth buying , love the story and hugh jackman
a crime family you ca n't help but love . suspense , love its all here with history told at its most entertaining level .
this is one of my favorite shows and am glad amazon offers it to us , my only problem is am having trouble with amazon streaming .
this is certainly one of the best mib movies i have seen . it certainly is better than the second movie ( which i liked ) and is as good or better than the first mib . good fun !
i 've enjoyed this movie from the first time i saw it many years ago . i decided to get it for my son who likes comedies , also . it is a classic to me .
so much taste in the story telling , only an italian could do it !
great ! ! i strongly recomend it ! anthony hopkins is the best ! good suspense and love the ending . second time i watch it
this movie went straight to the heart . i 'm not sure if this movie would be for younger children although for adults its great .
i 'm watching this movie right now and i had to pause it just so i could write this review this is a another great movie well back to the movie
this is exactly what you would expect from billy . all of the classic moves . great cardio workout . really enjoy it !
i love this movie ! it 's a great animated movie , even if it 's not historically accurate . the songs are wonderful and the characters are endearing . definitely one of my favorites . = )
it 's ok. i just do n't really care for these kind of movie 's . a friend was here and wanted to see it . i guess it is probably a ok movie if you like this stuff .
great movie for fans of the first movie . i was amazed at the creativity and the beauty of it . great for all ages .
big explosions , video game type movie . it was more about graphics than plot . do yourself a favor and stick with the original .
for the fans of frank and the lovers of a great comedic plot . it is a good clean movie which you can watch with you little ones .
definitely a good buy and has been inspiring to watch to . inspiring and all together feel good movie . just awesome !
great price , prompt service , i would highly recommend this to add to your collection at home . do n't miss out on this one .
one of the best , if not the best . you read the other reviews . just get it already . the price is right .
having listed to audio book , wanted to see movie . book was great , kinda disappointed the movie went off course from the book somewhat .
good acting , good story , good plot and a good ending . it even shows you how to pick up girls that you never would have expected to be interested in you .
good acting but the story line was lacking . depressing story about very flawed people . no redeeming features to movie . no reason to feel good about watching it .
i liked it was not great but good i liked the story but it is classic serial of the time
these are both funny movies . package came in condition as promised and on time . would recommend these movies for a good laugh .
these guys did such a good job in the first sherlock holmes i could n't pass up this one . they are so funny together and play off of each other so well .
this is a great show . but is coming to an end , glad i bought it i do not think the story line could have cast a better cast of actors
another disney winner , family fun and full of laughs . this is what today 's movies should be like instead of the junk being put out now . highly recommend the seller for service .
it was good to watch it after not seeing it in the long way i think it is another good movies
war horse is a great movie . i loved it . great story ... great movie . worth the money ! cried several times ... for the characters , and the horse : (
this series brings back many memories from when i was growing up in the 50 's . the music is terrific and many of the scenes are incredible .
i loved every season of the west wing . it was as good at the end as it was at the beginning . love this show !
happy with the movie . its been years since i have seen this ! i would recommend to anyone that grew up in the 80 's : )
great spoof very funny -- it was meant to entertain -- it does ! saw it on tv then bought it .
one of my all time favorites . perfect to watch with anyone . since horses are my passion , this was right up my alley . recommend it for anyone .
if you like the scary movies this one is well worth watching . i liked it alot !
great movie . great service by vendor . it arrived sooner than expected and in great shape . a pleasure doing business with the vendor .
i am a huge tim allen fan . while this movie is not his best - in my opinion - it still is very much worth owning and sharing with friends .
this is an entertaining movie and a good western . you should enjoy it provided you have not the least interest in historical accuracy .
great movie . bought it for wife and she absolutely loves it . great price also . would buy more if they are all that price
i loved this movie as a kid and i still love it as much as an adult . my children love it too ! good family movie . : )
having watch sets one through seven so far , i can say the quality of the stories are great and i look forward to the last two with anticipation .
this was a cute movie ! it 's great to watch a movie the whole family can enjoy together ! you should see it !
how could anyone go wrong on owning old classic movies like tarzan . this is an excellent boxed set .
is a cool movie to watch , pretty funny and a light comedy i recommend it
still loved revenge of the fallen . a bit long in parts , but kept true to the story .
this is without a doubt , one of the funniest movies of all time ! you will laugh if you have a sense of humor !
a good amount of realistic action , characters are believable , and it can be watched and enjoyed by any one of any age .
it is a very good family movie and it was very appropriate for this christmas season . i recommend it for families every where .
wonderful movie . all members of the family will love . easy to download digital copy . packaging was easy to open . great for the library
what a great combo pack for christmas . my son was so excited to get & # 34 ; exactly & # 34 ; what he was asking for christmas !
i had not heard about this movie before but really like it should see it you like it i am sure
soft but easy to tear . it works on my ball of foot but does not last long which is the problem with this product .
i have all the step up movies and this one in 3d is the best of the bunch for the music and the dancing !
i chose this rating because it 's one of those scary movies you can actually see happening . it was n't over the top but very well done .
if you want the original release dont buy this . dont be a nerd , send the fat man a message . spend your money on star trek if you have to .
this movie had to much sex based subject matter , as a matter of fact that was basically the subject of this movie .
such a great comedy love movie . tom hanks and meg ryan are at it again in this great movie . & # 60 ; 3
i adore this movie . this is one of the few disney classics , young and old can enjoy it . took me back to being a kid again .
i had not seen the movie in theaters and just thought it sounded like it would be a good movie . i really enjoyed it more than i expected and have recommended it to several other people .
we bought this movie to complete our harry potter collection . great movie at a decent price so we 're happy with our purchase .
i love gunsmoke and always have ! my husband and i watch it almost every night . more shows should be made like gunsmoke !
my son loves this series of movies he does n't like scary he watches this and gets a kick out of it . clean family movie for halloween
i liked the story line and would watch it again sometime in the future . my husband liked it as well .
funny but stupid . there is no plot and nothing makes sense besides the fact that each scene has its own laughs .
i love one tree hill and the third season is my favorite season ! i loved it ! awesome show ! awesome season ! ; )
this is such a great little movie , we have watched it over & over so many time , every one will like it too . thanks
even though the story does n't mean much , it is always a pleasure to watch tom hanks and meg ryan , especially when they are young .
this is a great movie . a must have if you do n't already have it . on blu-ray the picture is perfect .
this movie is amazing . i watched it once and then decided to buy myself a copy of the movie . great for anyone !
loved it . difficult to watch at times due to the illness and battles people had to endure just to receive treatment , but an excellent movie .
i am not a good reviewer for this product . it did not hold my attention for 15 minutes . the end .
an okay movie . it could have been better . the acting was fine but it is definitely not a family movie .
excellent story . plenty of action . very realistic special effects . gives an excellent accurate account of how the war was fought .
this dvd has 4 of my favorite jimmy stewart westerns . it was sent quickly & i am very happy with it .
this is such a heartbreaking story ; at times it was difficult to watch . angelina jolie at her best ! highly recommended .
a way to escape to a different world and go on adventure . the characters are wonderful and there is lots of action .
one of my 5 top movies of all time . and # 1 as of the present . what an amazing piece of work !
addicting ! good balance of interesting plot with equally interesting characters . finished season two and started 3 .
great movie and very entertaining . it makes you feel as if u were there . i recommend that you watch this movie . great
i really loved this movie a lot . i am into historical and military movies very much . i have been always fascinated about early u.s. history .
great cast . good flick . fun plot with some twists . ending was lacking , but the movie is really worth it . see for yourself .
watched this movie when it first came out , so glad to have been able to add it to my collection . awsome movie
you have to see the movie . it will make you think what will you do if ! you were in there shoes . period
i have my own copy now and so does my sister . it 's well done and the actors are great . thanks
great movie ... with a twist at the end , that i did not expect ... . i recommend watching adding this movie to your & # 34 ; watch & # 34 ; list .
good children 's story , but it contains a lot of scenes that get very loud at times .
this is a dog . i could not stay with it . i tried 3 times . it is just to slow . it feels like a stage play not a movie .
i like watching show . i enjoy being able to watch television shows when i want . i am looking forward to getting the second season soon .
fell in love with morse years ago and have so enjoyed seeing lewis come into his own . love that they mention morse from time to time and influence he had on lewis . can watch over and over .
did n't get to watch the whole movie wife did n't like the foul language so we changed to a different movie
watched the entire movie but there were a few times i thought about turning it off . i like kurt russell but for some reason did n't care for this movie much .
good good good good good it was good i liked it why does this require so many words my goodness
i had been looking for this series since i read about the european version . now i ca n't wait for # 3 to be available on dvd !
i found this movie to be exciting and very captivating . i could n't pull myself away from the movie . i had to see what happened next . i would recommend this movie to everyone .
i highly recommend this movie . i had never heard of this movie and took a chance on it . it was worth it for sure .
very good special effects . worthwhile . great twist at the end . lots of violence so be prepared . but hey , its thor .
adult audiences and then it is a tough story , very haunting . superb acting ! much better than the us version , by far .
sort of has that million dollar baby feel about it , but nonetheless still a good movie , i liked it anyway
this has always been one of my favorite movies and i just love having it for my own and it 's just what it was advertised to be .
if you enjoy futuristic flicks , these are the greatest ! hope they come out with another series . the way it ended , they could !
the cd arrived in a timely manner and in very good condition . i gave it as a gift and they really enjoyed it . so i recommend it highly .
great product and i received quickly havent watched it yet but i have seen it before that why i bought it i loved it
danny kaye has always been a great actor and comedian . as far as my personal opinion , this is his very best !
i wanted to see this from the first trailer . usually movies like that disappoint me , but this was the exception . i dare you not to fall in love with emma watson in this movie .
i love this show . ever since i started watching it it 's always been hilarious . one of the funniest shows i 've ever seen
this is a great movie , but make sure you see that it is not region 1. other than that , it is perfect
it is a beautiful film with different stories of each member of a family , fantastic actors of first quality . i 'm waiting for a fourth season soon .
i hoped this movie would be at least acceptable but also thought that the weekend special price made it okay to stop watching if it was not so good . it was really good and the cast was fantastic .
this is one of my all time favorite shows and i have almost every season on dvd . this was a must have for my collection and i highly recommend purchasing it .
this was a good movie but i did not like the end , it was maybe alittle confusing and it let open some questions of is this real or a dream .
this cartoon was great - funny , heartwarming , great dialog and voice cast was cool . i enjoyed it almost as much as `` despicable me '' . would definitely recommend to both kids and adults alike .
since friends , there has n't been another show like this . i would recommend everyone to see the series if they have n't already .
love this movie , although as a child i was really scared by it . watched it recently with my 9 year old , she loved it as well .
this movie is so hilarious ! im a big will ferrell fan and he keeps showing me why ! this was too funny
bought this and other classics to add to our collection . great price ... no shipping ! ! we 're very pleased .
i love this show . i am really glad i purchased this box set and when theres nothing great on tv on a rainy day these dvds come really in handy .
i bought this for a gift , so i sure hope she loves it . it is right up her alley , funny & christmas .
this is a story of 2 people who are truly i love in real life . i enjoyed hearing their story ! i highly recommend it !
i do n't think so . this was not really funny at all , even though i love steve carell . must have been one of his first
not since the blue brothers has one viewer had so much fun watching a film . it was almost like watch a live action cartoon .
& # 34 ; got ta watch & # 34 ; movie . denzel acting , always makes you believe his characters . keeps you interested , was surprised at the end as well
i just started season 2. if you like sci-fi you then this is for you . it can be corny at times but that is what makes it fun .
kids love it i love it : - ) besides it giving me some piece of mind while they watch this movie i must say i enjoy it as well even though they watched it over 30 times .
horrible horrible horrible horrible horrible ! i did not make it through five minutes . hoping for a nice romance ; instead , got nudity .
this is my all time favorite movie , makes me so happy everytime i watch it , it got it all funny sweet and a very important message .
this was a good way to kill a few hours but it was n't a great movie . i was expecting something closer to rush hour type humor .
picture quality was awful and it was so dated , that i just did n't want to waste my time watching it .
this is a great movie . i 've always loved it from the first time i saw it in the theatre . now my children love it . a great storyline that is fun and exciting .
did not hold my interest . the sound would go up then down , making it hard to hear and understand . it got frustrating .
this movie is one my wife could watch every week . the storyline is very good and the cast is remarkable .
robert downey jr did a very good job in this sequel . you will not be disappointed . no issues with the product itself .
i am a big fan of matthew mcconaughey and he did an excellent job in this movie . it was written for him in my opinion . great plot and storyline making it a great movie .
this is always a favorite . it is funny and fun yet touching . tom hanks does not disappoint in this film
great movie ! lots of action ! thought it has a good story line to it as well . loved the story in general .
if you like doris day , this is one of the most enjoyable . in my opinion she should have made more movies with garner . this is a fun movie .
it was an ok movie . nothing special ... a good performance from the rock ... but an enjoyable way to spend an evening of tv watching .
loved it , took a while to find a copy of this and i really enjoyed it .
i love dc . comics i 'll give this a 5 star . i like everything and i would recommend this to everybody . thank you .
i appreciate the fact that the story does not end so quickly . it is still very good . see it for yourself
nice concert but i like the earlier ones when they were younger and had more fire . songs are always memorable but give me a concert in the 70s .
both actors did a fine job of this ! loved the title song ! made during the best times for film producing ! such a great storyline !
those gorgeous faces . that kiss , the most famous in cinema history . one of the 100 all-time best films . perfect role for elizabeth taylor at that point in her career .
i love to hear my teenage grandson laughing as he is watching these videos . he loves them . it was a good choice .
our 2 grandchildren laughed so hard and really enjoyed this comedy . they watched it 2 days in a row and i must admit , i laughed right along with them .
i bought this as a birthday gift , for someone , who was looking for it , and could n't find it . she love 's it , she has already watched it 3 ( three ) times .
one of my favorites as a kid , great to be able to watch an episode when ever i have the time .
lots of action , good vs evil . a real story line . the good guys win ! a real good movie to watch with a big bowl of popcorn .
yeah . i got this movie because i love it . hilarious . bullock is such a great actress , and the script is very well written .
this movie is garbage . do n't think because there is a pretty girl on the front that this is anything you 'll like . actually , it 's probably one of the worst movies i have ever seen .
great romance , suspense , action , crime , and mystery movie ! ! ! ! has a great storyline , a few surprises and funny lines that kill !
we watch this every christmas season . everyone in my family loves it . it is not only funny , it also has the heart of the christmas season .
you have to get this ! its funny , cute , romantic , and guys theres fighting ! lol what more could you ask for ? buy it !
randolph scott is a favorite of mine . the story line is very good . just enough suspence to keep you watching . pause is a must when you leave the room . family can watch this movie..
unfortunately , if the christ were to return today , this is what would probably happen ... not ! it would be nice ! a delightful movie !
i thought this movie had an interesting plot . i did n't like the sad ending . but overall , i thought it was good .
very enjoyable and brings me back to those simple childhood days . i so appreciate being able to purchase these . thank you !
this is a great concert . all of roy 's classics are here . the sound and picture quality are great . this is a good addition to any music lovers collection .
they are fun action films about the mummy ... .not much more to say really . nice special effects .
my dad is a huge star trek fan and i knew this was the perfect gift to buy him for christmas ! he watched it all in one day .
a great combination of sci fi thriller and some comedy thrown in . this is the first time i watched this move and i loved it .
i got this movie because i was told it was good . it was alright , i guess i just was n't in the mood for it .
colin firth is the reason i gave the movie 4 rather than 3 stars . there are some unusual plot twists that give the film more style than otherwise .
this is an excellent dvd and i received it before the expected date and in excellent condition .
i really enjoy this series , but always miss the weekly show . i can not wait for the next season to go on sale .
what can i say about the lion king ? this is something i remember watching in my childhood days . always a treat to watch after 20 years . great buy !
ca n't go wrong with elmo ! my 2 year old loves this as an addition to his elmo halloween collection . we watch it all year around . we love the songs on it ! great dvd .

this was a really great movies for it 's time . i would definitely recommend this to lovers of old time movies .
i 'm an avid dancer , and love dance movies . i loved the story and the romance , but loved the dancing even more ! channing tatum is so hot in this movie ! ! !
i recommend this product to all people who love the twilight zone series . it is an awesome set that will make a great gift . how can you go wrong owning every episode .
this one of the best movies i have ever saw , of course i am a big robert deniro fan . i would highly recommend this movie to anyone ! ! !
this is a great movie with a wonderful story ! my three year old daughter loves it !

very enjoyable . my husband and i love the summer wine series . they give us a lot of enjoyment and laughs .
since i am the grandfather to a 10 year old , the movie was not my cup of tea , but my grandson thoroughly enjoyed it . watch it several times .
great movie ! creepy setting and storyline . recommended to all horror fans : ) pop the popcorn and turn off the lights and get for a scary treat . enjoy !
arnold does another fun job and you have fun with him in this movie and its your typical action movie that everyone should love .
bought this for my mom and she watches it over and over again ! she says it is hilarious through the whole series .
while the acting was just so so , it is however a fictional movie about a woman who is a cat - with this said , it is entertaining to watch !
it was a wonderful movie about changing lives and positive choices and letting new experiences happen . very great movie that was based on a true story .
a female cop - flawed ; a tragedy survivor - flawed ; they find each other . did not know i was a romantic until i saw this one . got ta love it .
foyle 's war is a fantastic series . the acting is great . the sets are wonderful . it needs to do more episodes .
great movie , marvel usually does good when it comes to feature films on the big screen . cant wait to buy the sequel soon !
it was good , but i liked the story line from the original better . acting was good too . i think it was worth the rental
given as a gift and it was appreciated . funny series . a lot of actors that will have continued to see over the years .
this is a very funny video and if you like comedy you have got to get this one .
i really wanted to like this series but could n't even force myself to finish the first episode , the acting was way over the top and just did n't do it for me .
it is good movie but a lot of talking and explaining from start to end , and not as i hope for . but it is very informative and interesting .
this was a good movie with the older , more mature shirley temple . she was a beautiful young lady back then .
even though it is my least favorite in the series it is still one i watch every two years or so .
so very enjoyable . this was made so interesting and about so many different horses and people . very well done . i want more of these .
i was so glad to help my neighbor out with finding a movie he wanted he is n't comfortable online so i ordered this for him thanks
love the old westerns , thanks for a great movie , i will be buying as they are provided from this source .
saw the first season just wonder how it ended . it was ok. high school girls or horse lovers . not a western .
there are many laughs in this movie ... . with lots of great acting ! ! ! entertaining , cute , sweet and funny ! worth the rental !
i think this is more interesting both visually and from a storyline perspective than the & # 34 ; other & # 34 ; original spiderman movie . certainly more action , and a little more of an edge .
i am still watching it over and over . great all around but i hope they will come out with a sequel to it soon .
i saw this movie before and it is good enough to see again . it is funny and poignant and just plain fun to watch .

this combo dvd , blue ray , digital is easy to use and understand and comes with a ton of extras . and it even works with itunes .
i saw this movie on television last year and really enjoyed it . sarah jessica parker does a great job in her character . i cried at the end .

we rented this video when our granddaughters ( ages 5 and 11 ) came to visit for the weekend and everyone watched it including grandpa . it was funny and smart like cartoons use to be .
how did this film get so many stars ? boring , bad acting and same old tired story . great for 15 year old kids , maybe . i turned it off after an hour . just awful .
we did not get introduced to this show until the third season . we then had to buy all three seasons and it is easy to see why folks have become addicted to it . excellent .
if you liked the first one , you will certainly get a kick out of the sequal ! funny from beginning to the very end credits ! ! enjoy !
this was one of mcconaughey 's best movies in my opinion . it was very thought provoking . i would recommend it to anyone .
love these movies and how realistic they make time traveling . we watch the set every few months and always enjoy them !
it was such a strange and evil movie . i wish they focused more on the demons , they really stole the show .
never knew jim could act so good . made the story line good enough to keep you entertained . good movie for family night .

just a wonderful series ! my wife and i watch alot of british comedies and this is really top self . a very funny show !
this is an incredible film so different from what i have ever seen ... i keep finding myself in suspense wondering what will develop at every turn ... . really neat !
ca n't hollywood be more creative ? seems that it is the same subject over , and over again ... they make too many movies that are too predictable .
its okay , nothing very special , i was disappointed it was not better , did seem like sherlock holmes movie to me
just not my style at all . watched it on recommendation from someone who enjoyed it immensely , but i could not get into it . maybe you will , maybe .
i like all science fiction and or action movies that have to do with greek mythology . the story line is so much different to the other films having to do with the greek gods about the titans !
did n't think much of it but just wanted to watch a movie . it 's visually beautiful at times , and acting we pretty good from some names i did n't recognize .
another remake of an old movie . did enjoy it and the plot twists were different than the original and the special affects are very good .
i never saw the show when it was on tv , but enjoyed watching the series years later . my favorite part of the show is getting to see hawaii !
i loved it . i will definitely watch this again , many times . i can only say that about a few movies .
i love batman and i was so excited to get all three movies together and for an excellent price ! ! the packaging was great and the movies as described .
i loved this one . all the characters were so good . it 's action packed for sure . kept me very entertained to the end .
good acting , on all the movies , definitely worth what i paid for it . good addition to my collection of movies .
very moving . just so hard to even imagine . happy ending but very hard to believe they all lived . bring tissues .
i liked it and i was entertained but i believe it lacked a lot of suspense and it was a little over the top and it 's ending was not believable but then hey , it 's hollywood .
clean good fun , suspenseful and has you on the edge of your seat in parts . definitely recommend for family viewing .
this a great movie . the actors are spectacular . the determination that the main character has to get closer to the man she loves is so moving . the movie is captivating .
bought it for my hubby for father 's day . it 's one of the oldie movies that he just loves it . he loves all the oldies !
ca n't get enough of this ; i loved watching it on tv when they used to play it each year . this is one classic owning is a must
good film for the whole family . some romance and drama which may bore the children a bit , but otherwise lots of action .
i 'm not into all the vampire and werewolf stuff , but this is totally different . i love the movies , so going to read the books
while this movie does n't follow the written story of the hobbit to the letter , i think what they 've done is very good and i look forward to seeing the next part .
these two are so funny together . i love mr. butler . i am so happy i added this movie to my collection .
great box set , does n't have the last crappy movie as a part of it . arrived in less than a week , much faster then expected .

love that movie , have n't seen it in years ! it was good to see it again . definitely gon na order this movie .
this movie is a fun , cult classic ! if you have n't seen it , it is worth it to get it because you will watch it again .
i really do n't get into movies like this it was bought as a gift for my daughter , so i do n't really know how to rate something like this .
it was not very different from other zombie movies , but it was entertaining . glad i saw it on prime and did n't pay to see in a theater .
maybe i missed it , but i ca n't give this video a higher rating , it was not a glued to the edge of my seat kind of move
even after all these years it 's still a great show ! it 's even better not having to watch commercials with it .
i was happy to be able to get this season . i really enjoyed every episode here . it was totally worth buying .
i am glad this was one i rented and did n't buy . dont really get it being so scary as a kids movie , the kids were n't too thrilled with it either
the only reason i watched this movie was to keep up with the previous sequels but as sequels go they were n't as good as the first but not totally boring either .
if you remember a better , easier time , when performers could actually sing , and had talent , then you will love this series collection ... worth checking out for sure .
i really loved this movie a lot . i am into historical movies very much . i am still amazed the still have n't found her yet .
myself and my kids loved this the first time we saw it . the darkness of the movie keeps you engaged .
one of the great classic comedies of all time . the dvd presentation is flawless . it 's unfortunate there are no extras .
at the time of seeing this film i was a mel gibson fan and a goldie hawn fan . but ... .. words fail me .
i have n't seen this yet but i will eventually . i think christmas movies are my very favorite type of movies and i like to see them at various times throughout the year .
bought this for my 10 year old grandson who plays basketball . he really liked it and nothing inappropriate for his age as i can remember .
i seen this movie on the hallmark channel i really like it that why i got i would tell every one to see this movie
i bought this movie for a friend whose daughter said that this was her favorite of all the barbie movies .
good vintage video for a gift to our granddaughter and her family . saw many years ago and remembered it again .
it was as good as the original and also is good for all ages and worth watching over again . great
so glad to finally get these 2 dvd 's of the movie and all the extras . got the movie on time and i like the dvd case and how it holds both dvd 's in place .
a movie got to be really good to keep my attention and this movie held its own ! buy it and i promise that you wo n't have any regrets ! ! ! ! ! !
this is a marvelous series . original and with humor . great character development and gets one thinking about possibilities . you need to start at the beginning in order to understand what is happening .
sorry - have not seen it yet - so ca n't comment now - but i trust it should be good .
my 11 year old loves spooky stuff these are great cause if my younger kids see too bits not too spooky
this is a fine hitchcock film , with cary grant and grace kelly at their best . story is exciting and has humor as well as adventure .

while i am not familiar with the super heroes , i enjoyed this movie . it should have been 30 minutes shorter .
i have always loved this show and have missed watching it . i know they show reruns on tv , but i like seeing them in order . it was such a great family show .
truly the best horror movie i have seen in a long time and it makes you think
there are some movies that are so brilliantly portrayed that all you need is to hear or read the title and you know you will be hooked . this is one of these films .
the package came in good conditions . as we expected the movie keep us still in front of our tv . excellent quality .
this wasnt only a good horror , and had actual depth to each character . thats all .
i 've been waiting for this movie to come on cable forever . it finally came on soap network a few weeks ago . very good
i thought i was going to watch a tom cruise movie , but was quickly surprised . i watched about 15 minutes of it , then moved on . could be of interest to a different audience .
this movie is really funny . kids will love it . this movie was made for family enjoyment . the movie is not just for kids , adults will find it very funny also .
this was a good movie that definitely surprised me . it was not what i expected , but definitely has that comic book feel . if you are curious check it out , i was not dissapointed .
the man is still kicking it . there is a lot of action in comedy as well as arnold 's one liners he 's known so well for
i really liked this movie because of the action and suspense . it really held my interest throughout the entire movie .
actually i bought this for my husband . he loves it and has even hooked our daughter into watching the show . he 's looking forward to the new season to come out .

i was very impressed with this movie ! i love the shrek movies , and this one certainly delivered on my expectations .
acting was superb ... story line was very real for those of us that lived through it . i enjoyed it very much .
pierce brosnan is a favorite . i enjoy pictures involving nature . they are not real and only a story . good job .
this movie had it all . excellent singing , love story , good story line , and tons of humor . check this one out .
the movie okay to comic book and cartoon persons and put them into to a real life movie was a great idea , but the scripted could of been a little better .
i am really enjoying this season , good story line great talent . good strong woman characters that all are not trying to look 19
i have just seen the one episode , but i did enjoy it very much . it is very clear and the actors and actresses are all doing a wonderful job . i intend to watch the entire series .
best movie yet with an all star cast . we loved this movie . funny . i might purchase it to watch again .
what can i say , this movie is just plain fantastic ! the acting is awesome all around . watched it twice and will watch it again .
the story line was good , entire movie could have been done in 30 to 45 minutes rather than long and drawn out .
came with no problems . have used this vendor numerous times . this is a great movie ! really enjoy watching it with family
this was close to following the book . the acting was very good . worth watching . i did prefer reading the books . which i read in order and they were amazing .
i thought this story line was completely ridiculous , did n't enjoy the acting and could n't even finish it . this one just was n't for me .
we enjoyed this movie which had a very fast pace . the characters were excellently portrayed . the villain was portrayed very well through the entire movie .
i loved it and ca n't wait for season two ! the acting was good the story line was great , has something for everyone ! looking forward to season two should be fantastic !
the way the actors interact with each other , and the beautiful way each scene develop is amazing ! , a must watch !
this is a great movie with some great stars and a great western star glenn ford . please some release this movie on dvd .
you ca n't go wrong with boris karloff , if your a fan of his movies this is one for your collection , you wo n't be sorry .
i love this movie . has an all star cast and keeps you on the edge of your seat . the ending is a real mind blow as well . great story and well done movie .
good but the others were better i think . love robert he is a favorite to watch anything he does , i see
this is a great collection , a must have for any rocky fan ! the movies look amazing in blu-ray and the case is really cool .
this is the greatest show to ever get canceled . i swear that everything i love on tv gets the boot , and all the crap i do n't gets at least 7 seasons .
i love all these movies . i love romance movies that have a good plot . all of these plots were very different also which keeps them interesting .
this was a movie that was picked by mistake but at the end it turned out to be a good one to make
having grown up with these super heroes , the video brought back many memories . i have passed the video to my grandson .
surely do hope that i have ordered this for what i have been able to catch on tv is grand . maybe i can find the original purchase somewhere .
this movie was funny , entertaining and good for all ages . wish i could have gotten it in 3d , gave the dvd to my grandchildren .
i think this movie is the best one to watch because it is better than the johnny depp version called charlie and the chocolate factory
suspenseful , at a good pace , well acted . leaves you thinking at the end ! !
love friday the 13 , hated this movie . it does not have enough death scenes and lacks suspense
one again jerry showed how creative and talented he was especially the scene in the board room . no one can beat his talent for comedy .
i really enjoyed family matters when it was originally on the air . i hope they come out with the rest of the seasons on dvd soon . fun show !
this is definitely not what i expected . i should have read the buyer reviews more carefully ! be sure you read the description and reviews , to make sure you want this film .
but this movie sucks . it 's not like the other tinker bell movies at all . this was a no no for me .
jude law and katherine jones were rock stars in this one ! i waited for it to come out and it as worth the wait
i thought that the story was ok. it seemed a little unreal that men would pay to play with a sleeping girl and also pay to die by the girl .
ordered this movie in blu-ray and it looks wonderful on the big screen . had it on regular dvd , and wanted to see it in blu-ray . definitely recommend it .
excellent series . can not wait for the next season . fast moving with good character development . would have completely missed it if not for amazon
another movie i saw as a child . also have the dvd . really makes you think hard about the possibilities of being born evil .
one of the best pictures i have seen in awhile . good actors and good acting . take the time to see it .
this is a must see movie . it has lots of life lessons and of course robert duvall is a great actor . inspirational !
this is my daughters favorite movie . i bought it for her . she loves the movie . all in all it is a good movie .
this is a good family movie and has very good bad guy family guy change of heart content . it is all around a good movie .
this movie left me wanting more . the surprise at the end for sandra bullock from mccarthy was unexpected and appreciated .
this was a very heart warming movie . eddie murphy shows again that he can indeed act . i enjoyed this movie a lot .
i really enjoyed this movie and i have the ` original movie and it stays real close to the orginal movie .
this movie is just plain fun . it is a nothing special plot , just light , entertainment that is very well executed .
this is what a super hero movie should be i enjoyed it i would not buy the dvd if i did not like it .
i 've always liked this movie and now can watch as many times as i want to since you do n't see it on tv anymore
this movie was intriguing , but i was left with more questions than answers . i found it hard to keep up with the storyline , but that could have been me .
a great and superior family narrative about struggles they go through both as individuals and as a family
tyler perry always know how to entertain and teach a lesson all in one line ! good movie and funny . will watch again
tom and jerry are their favorite . they enjoyed this dvd while riding in the car . i could hear them laughing the whole time .
this movie is n't very good so do n't waste your money because it is a 2nd rate movie , is the way i see it .
was a lot better than i expected . good enough to buy . not your average ordinary movie . i would recommend watching it .
i loved watching this show ! a must watch for those that enjoy suspense and/or zombies . the characters are well developed despite being an action filled series .
this movie is just beautiful . beautiful story , funny , sad , and so real . beautifully written . steve martin is amazing . and it wrote the story too !
this isnt as good as the originals nobody can do the original guy so you might not like it as much butt if its first time seeing pink panther you might laugh your head off .
it is a great love story . you will cry you eyes out and then want more . it has a good story .
i thoroughly enjoyed this movie . i would recommend it to anyone . i think it is worth watching more than once .
this blue ray disk has a good story line and quality computer animation . the sale price was a very deal .
24 has it fans for a reason , the suspense , the action , and the twists and turns are well developed . i am glad to see it return again this year .
if by chance you believe in heaven and hell , this movie is spooky ! especially if you watch it by yourself !
heartwarming and you believe in your fellow man and that there is good in people and sometimes money is not that important
this is a wonderful christmas show , its timeless , with 2 of our greatest singers .
best of all of the twilight movies . the direction in this one was so much better than with the past movies .
this was a disappointment . the same old story played in the same old way boring me half out of my mind .
i had n't seen this movie in many years - i am so pleased to see it again and share it with younger friends who never knew how great hepburn and bogart were in this movie .
even after watching this movie over 30 years after it hit the movie theater , it 's still a great hit . every sequence is worth watching over and over again . bruce we miss you .
this is a great movie . it arrived only 1 day late , but around christmas time i expect that . i have no complaints .
there is nothing i can say about this movie that has n't already been said . it is one of the few young adult comedies that is actually funny instead of being just plain stupid .
i loved this movie . i have seen it many times over the years but it was not on dvd yet . i was so glad to finally have a copy of it .
this workout will get you going and you will have alot of fun doing it too . this dvd is very good and i would say get this one a try . and go ahead have some fun !
i found this movie to be rather good , a little slow , but good . i 'd recommend it to most anime fans .
i enjoyed this movie when it first came out , and after all this time i still find it interesting and well worth watching .
this movie was funny , romantic and it had a very good message ! i will watch this movie over and over again .
last season and left me wanting more ... wonder if the sopranos were taking away the viewers . needless to say , the sopranos can be seen on amazon prime too ! ! !
this is an easy movie to watch over and over again . it is cute and funny . the humor is clean and family appropriate .
i brought this movie for my mama , and likes it very well . radio is a very touching movie for the whole family member who are from ten and up .
katherine hepburn , cary grant , and james stewart were at their best ! they were all charming in this funny , lovable movie . enjoy !
if you love zombie movies this is a must see ! brad pitt and all the cast was excellent . book and movie are both worth the time ...
we have watched all in the series . truly worth every minute ... you will enjoy the whole series ... worth your time , for sure
i added this film to my collection and i will be purchasing the third and final film also . ca n't wait !
awesome . if you loved this series you must get this dvd set . you will not regret it one moment .
great adaptation , i 'll always prefer the anime but really well done for a live action movie . i like the different ending as well , made it extremely interesting to watch .
it started out okay , a bit overly predictable but watchable . it was n't too bad but i would not watch again .
just watch it . the deleted scenes to be included in this dvd are supposed to be great . funniest movie in a long time .
another family classic . a must have for the holidays . george scott was great as playing scrooge . a great family movie with substance .
i love this show and the price was great for it being the most recent when i bought it . the case for the dvds was a little worn but the discs work great , no skipping .
it keeps you wanting more . i look forward in purchasing the rest of the series well done thank you love it
check this movie out . you do n't know what to expect until it hits you right on the face . you wo n't be disappointed .
like all the harry potter books this also has a lot of action and a good ending . the whole series gets a huge 2 thumbs up .
this movie is not as good as the others of freddy and jason but i wanted the whole collection
an outstanding book and an outstanding movie . even i , a grown man , who has seen almost everything wanted to cry .
if you have ever seen any of these movies before , this is the way to own all three in one package at a great price with much better english subtitles .
watched this movie with my grandkids and we all loved it . from the time the movie started , nobody moved . it was great !
the second season was great and of course led to the movie . needed a third season and maybe a fourth .
content of the movie it 's self a little dry . not his best work . try , try again . oh well running out of inspiration .
i love the series , l hope they continue the series . it is one of my favorites . i wonder if there will be a seven season ... .
i loved the movie it just so sad of whats its all about things be happening & you do n't know anything about
the waltons was my favorite tv show when our children were growing up . i am delighted to be able to see all these shows again .
i absolutely love the whole series , the actors are very good and seem to love their job . it almost seems real !
i had already seen these 2 movies & enjoyed them . great price ... thanks for this great offering , especially at christmas time .
somehow i remembered it as much better when i watched it on tv years ago .
way too slow of a start . thought val was okay , but come on let 's explain the story a bit more . too many characters to start . stopped after about 30 : minutes .
what a great show . so enjoy the ole good movies . the pure and innocent , no cussing , no swearing , just good movies
i thought this was a great movie anyway , in hd it 's even better .
well written and acted , with great scenery , good action and a wonderful ending . just the movie for a snowy saturday afternoon .
this is a different type of scifi movie . it is mostly just sandra bullock ( who i really like ) , but i did n't really care for this movie .
although i love denzel , i did not like this movie . it was slow , the characters were boring . i am surprised i watched it to the end !
love this movie , after watching it several times on netflix i went looking and found it here for a great price !
michael jackson is the best entertainer the world has ever known . i am glad to own this collection of his talent on film .
this turned out to be a good movie , a little slow at first , but it picked up , kept me entertained
who needs the modern day gore . this movie is creepy . and the woman is so twisted . i love these old suspense thrillers .
a great video for watching what & quot ; the life & quot ; was like in the 50 's era . a nicely done movie .
cute movie with lots of action . good humor and not packed with adult humor . this movie is really made for kids
remember watching this superman series when i was a child . it was amusing . technology has improved over time . thanks for the memories
great movie ; but , was a little disappointed in the poor condition of the dvd case .
hated it ! i couldnt watch more than 20 minutes of it , even with all the a list stars involved .
i watched this with my 13 and 10 year old son and felt the movie was a little to gory too watch with kids . i did not feel that way about the first movie .
no one does nature like the bbc . this ranks right up there with the planet series they also produced . well worth the money .
definitely not as funny as i had expected , but if you can find it for free , it 's worth watching if you have nothing else to do .
gary cooper is great in this movie , very enjoyable . one of the best actors of his time and my favorite .
this is a vhs and i wish it was dvd but still a good story that needs to be remembered .
funny , funny movie ! we loved it -- i 've watched it several times . cate blanchett is marvelous in this .
my husband and i both enjoyed this movie . it was not predictable and was very entertaining . we 'd recommend its viewing !
like ryan reynolds , think he 's funny , and though it made me laugh a couple times , not worth the hour and a half of your life .
good movie , if you like thor 1 you will love thor 2. also if you liked the avengers you will totally dig this one .
how could you not enjoy these two guys . i love both of them and the show is entertaining . love westerns
love debbie reynolds ! ! ! have looked for this movie for the last couple of years . looked on amazon and there it was , so i ordered it .
i enjoyed this movie very much . i almost cried while watching . good movie for young and old . i highly recommend this movie .
do n't waste your time . this is someone 's sick idea of a movie . really ! i had to fast forward through this mess . i guess curiosity got the better of me .
clean for the kids , hysterical for adults ! fun time enjoyed by all , minions are super funny and are worth watching for ! !
i watched this movie with my family and it was very good . you can watch it too and will be happy .
great shows with miss marple would tell people to watch this and buy from this place again if you like mysteries this is the show for you
i bought this dvd for my daughter and she loved it ... i liked this movie.i liked halloween ii i think better , but both were great movies ... .
this is one of those movies that you can watch over and over again . a feel good movie that is one of the best around . i love it .
this movie had a lot of big names , it tried to be a classic , i love hackman , crowe is less than stellar , stone is n't to great , etc .
we are very satisfied due to getting it in a reasonable fast time ! ! ! ! disk and disk cover in good shape ! ! ! ! was able to buy this as a present ! ! ! !
used to watch this all the time growing up . it was great watching these episodes again and remembering all the great jokes and chemistry of the actors . disks were new and box was in great shape .
i bought this one after buying the cardio dance because i enjoyed that one so much . it is fun to do and will definitely help you get your cardio on . i love it ! ! ! ! !
the person that sold this to me was fine , but the movie was not what i thought it would be .
this has been out for many years and it 's still a great movie to watch . the dinosaurs that come to life are great and give a somewhat accurate picture of what they were like back then .
some good fights and some very funny comedy , although once watched a few times begins to wear a little thin . generally a good movie .
arrived fast and is just as described . was so happy to find loved as a kid brought back great memories .
i have always loved this movie and i am so glad that i have it on dvd now ! this movie cracks me up !
this is a really good deal and a really movies to have and enjoy with the family so order a copy
the acting was okay , the filming was decent , but the story was really awful . this was not a film i would recommend but some may find it interesting .
the first season of charlie sheen 's new show is wonderful it shows off mr sheen 's comedic skills and has a wonderful ensemble a must have
a new insight to the man . movie was surprising and entertaining . would recommend this to anyone that has a strong opinion on the man and times . it might surprise you .
as one of favorite movies of all times , i finally own this wonderful copy . now to sit back and enjoy .
i have been a fan of & # 34 ; are you being served & # 34 ; for a while . these is the spin off from that . all i can say is i love every episode .
this was a very interesting and well thought out movie . it shows how the justice system works for black people without money and for black people with money .
explained thoroughly on all seasons , gets better and better and better and funnier ... ..i bought each season of course i love the show .
wore out the vhs years ago . really creepy funny . a great movie to pop in the dvd when people are over and bored to tears cause they have seen everything thats out there .
this is an awsome movie that will have you on the edge of your seat . i would recommend this movie to friends and family .
again john wayne at his best in these three b movies still a bit dated compared with his later a movies but fun to watch .
the movie was completely awesome ! i just ca n't wait for part 3 !
i liked the acting , i did n't like the premise of the thing . its not ok , what she does . the word is love .
amazing i really loved the story and all the characters where amazing and i enjoyed it very much and recommended to everyone who is interesting in that kind of stories
i miss movies that had a good messages along with a little romance and comedy . i miss great actors like this .
this move i tell you the cast the theme and everything about it was amazing ! ! ... this movie has it all . a must get and watch movie .
good buy the movie i was looking for plus a few more that i had n't seen and really liked and i watch a few times
i 'm not a musical fan but this was very enjoyable . it was colorful and exciting with fun music mixed in .
the story line is good . i enjoyed the book , more in it of course , but the writing was poor . the movie sticks to the clever story line , and is gripping .
a not often seen on tv movie that is as exciting , beautiful to watch , intriguing and entertaining as it was when first released in the movies .
this was a bit drug out for my taste i 'll keep it with my vin diesel movies only because he 's in it
i just wish i had every episode of this wonderful show ! it is never disappointing and always entertaining , plus the gorgeous scenery .
this is a good movie ; it 's sort of fast paced , with a good story line . it 's funny , without being too terribly silly
i love this series . the ensemble cast , the mysteries . i love everything about it . i ca n't wait for season 4 .
my family and i love this tv series . when it was on tv we would hurry home so we did n't miss it ... thank you amazon for bringing it back
very happy to get this dvd , the lead singer has since gone solo . fantastic condition , arrived on time , would order from them again .
i love this movie so much that i watched it over and over again . one of my favorite movies ever . i highly recommend it .
its got it moments and some parts are funny than action and than takes a left and goes into something else all together but all in all its ok , its seems like its part comedy , action ,
if you looking for a lot of laughter , get this movie it 's funny as hell . and also have alot of top actors and comedians .
could n't resist this classic for my collection . no problem with ordering or receiving the product . always great to do business with you .
i know this is supposed to be a classic , but it is awful , unless you are a fan , do n't bother .
dustin hoffman is so funny in this movie . we watch a lot of movies during the winter and this is always great for a lot of laughs .
it contains some scenes that are filled will violence and nudity . i would not recomend it for children . it 's geared more for older people .
i would recommend this to just about any one . the movie kept your attention all the way along and had a very good story .
these films are some of the best , especially for animated movies . we enjoy watching them often and sharing them with our older children . i recommend them to anyone .
i love the disney pirate movie series . i think they are very entertaining and fun . i have the whole set .
will ferrell should not have been chosen to play the leading actor for this movie . nicole kidman did a much better job than he did . the tv series was much better .
i think this is the best comedy movie of this generation . it is absolutely hilarious . if you have not watched it yet . then you need to .
love this christmas movie . definitely adding it to my christmas movie collection . super cute story line . love this movie and would definitely recommend it !
one of my all time favorites ! makes one think of their very first pet and how much you come to love them .
i heard a lot of rave reviews by so many people but found the story line predictable . the scenes themselves were grand and well done . not a bad movie and i 'd watch of again .
i love this movie . tom hanks is adorable in this . all the actors are perfect for the roles that they play . it 's a love story with a very unusual twist .
i bought this movie for my niece and she is super happy with it ! it came exactly as it was described .
there will never be another movie like this one . i 've watched it too many times to count and will watch it that many more .
you ca n't go wrong in buying this boxset . any i love lucy show is worth the $ !
mcconaughey nails this part , everyone in the movie does a great job , very entertaining movie . they need to turn another one of the books into a move ...
some of the sci fi program from my past was good , but i could never get into buck roger like before .
i got this for my son . it 's his favorite series . of course anything with zombies is his favorite . he 's watched it over and over and will continue to do so !
yes and he acts just like he did on his tv show and is just as loveable now as he was back in his own show
one of the most realistic crime films made . the interview with the writer of the book was especially interesting and at the same time , frightening .
this series is like the others . i have enjoyed all of them and have all of them so far . very entertaining .
i love the hair band music from the 80 's and this dvd did n't disappoint . it is super cute but i would n't advise any parent to show this to anyone under 18 .
this is a great action packed movie . will keep you guessing through the whole movie . great to watch with your friends .
robert redford is a great actor , and he is very good in this role . there are few movies that tell a good story and are wholesome in doing so .
this film made the roman army real . history at it 's finest ! wonderful costumes , great color . will watch this again , worth the rental !
this is a good move . show how some people need to watch how they do and act as much what come out of their mouth can do for you
i have seen the movie , and love it , but how can i rate the movie now since i have not received it from you all yet . goofy .
a really good story line . depicts live as it was during the time period . sad but very interesting . held my interest .
it was not the best movie but not terrible . pretty much what i had expected . tears did appear once or twice . good ending and sweet message about believe and not giving up
i usually like hugh grant 's movies , but this one was kinda dumb . i did n't care for the female lead at all .
this movie had more twists and turns than i expected and i was so happy with my rental . it definitely lived up to expectations and i would definitely consider purchasing this movie in the future .
exciting movie - lots of action - acting was very good - jennifer lawrence ( she makes almost any movie worth watching ) .
a funny parody of walk the line , great for a laugh , it 's a very silly movie , love this type of humor
delivery was timely as promised . since the item is a christmas gift , i 've no idea of the quality , but i assume it is as advertised .
i was expecting a more strong story , i felt it a little weak , but i did enjoy the action and part of the story .
this is the best special feature from the lord of the rings special features . the scenery is fantastic . the dvd was in good shape when it arrived and was what we ordered . enjoy !
this was not a good movie , the trailer was better than the movie . the actors were bad , not worth seeing .
john cusack was awesome in this . that was really great . i watch this a lot all the time . they were incredible . loved it .
probably greatest tv show ever . so far ahead of its time . this show set tone for everything scifi that followed
this is the most fun movie with great singing . i watch this over and over for that alone . do n't miss this one . it 's a gem .
overall , just great script , performances , characters . perfect movie , really , no flaws . i love this movie .
funny , funny , funny ! bill cosby had me laughing at the bill cosby show . he is just as funny today . i agree , bill , that you are far from finished .
the movie has the characters that you liked and scenes that are funny . but i did n't like the story . i am not a game player when it comes to relationships so i had lost interest .
i saw it a long time ago . need to pay attention from the beginning otherwise you 'll be missing what it is all about .
a classic of the genre . wanted to view the tv version but needed to catch up first . the dvd was in great shape and arrived promptly .
i ordered this to complete my andy griffith series . love to watch these old shows and the grandkids think they are great .
before super natural , we learned what a lady in white was in this movie . scary enough to hold our attention , innocent enough for the kids . so cute . sad though
the show was the most detailed of any police movie made . the action in it was amazing and very true to life .
season seven was great ! ! back to normal somewhat with the characters and the great stories continue . this season was a great one !
the movie was very enjoyable . i thought it was better than the first one . would recommend to everyone . a great movie for the entire family .
this was a good movie but kinda predictable . it did n't have that magical feeling like disney 's old movies .
this is the stuff of greek tragedy . long after repeated viewings , you find yourself thinking that yes indeed , it is that good . a must . a perfect gift for mother 's day .
good kid movie and adult as well . good story line with a modern ending that is a good message for girls and boys alike while also being a very enjoyable story just to watch .
dvd is good quality just not the best songs to much politics and i did n't notice the rating because there is swearing that surprised me glad no kids were around
my best friend n i love love this movies and she told me to buy it because i would like it and she was right i loved it
i 'd recommend this movie for any night of week . guaranteed to make you laugh ! ! uncle buck is my fav , but they both are wonderful ! ! helps for missing john candy ! !
$ hit ... if you are gon na get one or the other , go with this double pack . need i say more ?
one of my favorite adorable shows , brings back a lot of memories , thank you so much for having it available to me .
this talks about the ghosts of hollywood and marilyn monroe ! sounds like a lot of fun !
worth the watch , moved well , and was a surprisingly adult for a `` children 's '' movie . it may not be suitable for middle school or younger children .
this show is very cute and has a lot of episodes on it . great buy !
i bought the movie for bradley cooper . a very funny and good summer movie with a summer team , of course !
enjoyed everything about this movie . very exciting movie . there are not many movies i would watch twice , but this one i would .
a change from dvd to blue ray in the the underworld collection and in a complete set was a bonus
you could tell this was one of the first ones this is nice i like this format as well as the newer ones .
awesome set . now you can see why harry potter is one of the most enjoyable movie series of all time .
what could be better than ernest at christmas . this is a family tradition to watch this movie every year . love it .
anything john cusack is in is a good movie . this one was no exception . held my interest through the whole movie
this movie was a lot of fun to watch , the whole movie was well written and very enjoyable to spend some time watching
my son told me about the show a few years ago and now we own all the seasons . the special features are good and it 's great to be able to watch the show without commercials .
i liked the plot and the possible ending the movie could have taken . i really enjoyed the idea of making a living like that .
bought this dvd for my 6 year old granddaughter as a christmas gift , my understanding is that she loved it .
the movie in general is super . arnold at his best . the rest of the cast is a bit wooden but that is to be expected .
i hate reading movies but i really liked this one . i would watch it again . great stunts and really entertaining .
this is my favorite version of the timeless classic . i got the special edition for myself and for a friend who simply loves pride and prejudice .
i really love the action in this movie . some of the language however , is a little over the top . the purchasing experience was wonderful . fast shipment and the condition was just as advertised .
it does n't get better than this ... and , yes ! , i believe it 's more & # 34 ; ginger and fred & # 34 ; than the other way around .
this is one of my husband 's favorite shows . it combines his love of scifi with history . the actors are developing their characters well and the scripts are tight .
this is a classic slapstick style comedy . love bill murray in this one . quality of amazon streaming was great . highly recommend .
i love this movie . what a great story . i watch this movie a lot and never get tired of it . the cast and the movie was excellent !
i enjoyed this film . while the ending was predictable , it was enjoyable to watch . the music was great also . i can give this film a good recommendation
we really could n't get into this series . it just started out with so much unnecessary foul language . i will never understand why writers thinks this is what draws a crowd .
i 've been searching for this movie with a good price on it . i was very surprised and happy with the price of this movie . thank you now my husband has the complete set
wish i had known that the pilot episode would be included in the season 1 collection . now i have 2 of the same episode .
classics which i had on vhs and i wanted dvd to last . good quality movies that you will enjoy . john wayne is a hero of the war movies .
this movie collections talks about how a group of people get together for reasons that society puts them together . it shows how together they can overcome anything it comes against them .
this is the spin off series from dr who , just watched the 1st 2 episodes . great entertainment , good quality sets , the 1st of the 2 episodes both had great creatures to be fought !
i bought this as a birthday gift for my boyfriend , he loves it , this is all he ever watches anymore ! !
i do n't even know why this concept was wasted to film ... i want my time back for watching this so called & # 34 ; movie & # 34 ;
i mean , do you need me to tell you why this is good ? it 's toy story , come one , you know you 're going to watch it .
tom hanks is great in any movie he is in . he is so funny . this movie had me laughing until i was almost in tears
just like i remembered the show , it is still a good family show and my youngest daughter enjoyed watching every episode .
purchased for my husband as it is one of his favorite films . not one of my favorites even though it is a christmas classic .
please keep movies like this coming love it prime is becoming one of the best site to watch movies and tv shows
awful , just awful . a waste of time . not humorous . awful ... awful
my son loves all dog movies and this one was n't any different . price was reasonable and he enjoyed it . good .
season 5 has to be the best season . the boys are on fire in this season and as hot as ever . highly recommend ! ! !
this movie was enjoyed even by my husband who usually falls asleep watching dvds . a person could not but like the positive attitude of the young man
this is one of my favorite movies and when i am in the mood for john travolta this is one of my picks .
this was a gift for my friends daughter and she loves to watch this dvd all the time ... would recommend for girls ...
what do you say about the greatest drama series ever made . all seasons a must see .
this is the kind of story you remember and go back to over and over again ... again many thanks , bill
my granddaughter just loves all the animals in this movie , she dances to the music . so worth getting for her . she is only going to be 3
fast delivery great product good price well worth it . i 'm trying to get all of the avengers movies or what i can get .
save your money and time . dont rent this movie ! i was glad i didnt see it in the theaters . what a waste !
i am a huge fan of the predator series ... this movie completes my collection . it takes be back to the original w/ arnold s !
really cute movie even though this plot has been used many times . i think the actors are so charming , that it just works .
i really love the mummy movies , and this blu-ray collection allowed me to get them all at a really good price !
doctor who is a fun and almost corny sci fi adventure ... but in a good way . it 's never slow . i have been enjoying every season so far

great buy ! this is a very funny movie and great for the whole family ! wo n't stop laughing ! great messages in the movie too .
this is a pretty erotic story with not so bad acting . i would not own it but rent it next time as once is enough
engrossing yet humorous is the best way to describe the complete 7 years , the only thing wrong with & # 34 ; the closer & # 34 ; is there are only 7 seasons .
season 6 could have been better as the story had more potential than what was revealed but , that is not to say i did n't enjoy it immensely . must watch .
love the show , and i 'm happy to have started my collection . also bought greek chapter one . will buy the rest .
another great english comedy ! they really know how to cast a film . enjoyed the film greatly and will watch it over and over .
i really liked this movie ! i bought it for my kids to watch and i ended up enjoying it more . a very classic animated movie , for the whole family . i recommend to anyone !
action packed , typical cage movie . the acting was good could have pick a better person for female lead , but a good movie , enjoyed it .
these were so funny & so good . i 'm glad we got them as we love these old movies . thank you .
i do not care for horror movies but my daughter and husband love them . they were both excited by this purchase .
they could have done more with this . story line was lacking as was the vision . it completes the collection , but i wo n't watch it as much as the others .
loved seeing these two films and being on an led tv and blue ray felt like i was in there with them . great actors , great writing and very believable . two thumbs up !
this show is worth watching . i enjoyed all the actors and the moral lessons . i would watch it again . you generally ca n't go wrong with hallmark videos for family viewing .
i liked season 1 and 2 a little better than this season , but its still a fantastic show and i enjoy it
i do not have much to say of this film but skip it . trust me it is horrible . and all the people that gave this film good reviews definitely doesnt know what a good film is .
laughter , sadness , tears , and triumph ! who could ask for more in a movie ! the wife should really get much credit for the humor in this tale .
a wonderful book was brought to light in film through superb casting . a great job with obvious time and effort put into the making of this movie . a must see .
i always love an oldie . they do not make them like these any more , and it is a real shame , because they are really good .
the two racing personalities were really the theme but the racing scenes were superb . nice work . engrossing film for the human element of what it takes to win taken from different points of view .
this is one of the very best movies i have viewed . it was intense and the acting was excellent . i recommend
great music and excellent and entertaining dancing . acting and story line alright but not great . entertaining and i would buy it again .
i watched these when my grand kids were growing up , so i got the 13 set and sat and enjoyed all of them all over again .
found this movie funny and laughed a lot during the movie.. the actress is good and she adds and bring to life her character .
this movie arrived on time and in excellent condition . this another good movie that like the bar drinking , then some shooting . i would recommend this movie to anyone for purchase .
got this for my daughter . we saw the movie and she has wanted it ever since . she is getting other brave items . this was well packaged , came promptly and was exactly as described .
this movie made me like james bond even more . daniel craig is awesome . lots of action ! buy this movie ! it 's cool !
this was a good movie i gave it 4 stars , i love anything with arnold s. he 's such a good actor i hope he continues making good movies for all of us to enjoy .
we all should take a lesson from tyler perry 's movies . there is always a message in any movie he makes .
of , course , this is a classic , as far as i am concerned , ca n't beat jack lemmon , no matter what he does , he does it well ! ! !
not all that entertaining for anyone older that 3 or 4. this movie was cute but predictable . it was worth the $ 5 .
having seen the broadway musical this is a wonderful reminder of a show and of a time long gone but should n't be forgotten
i bought this as a gift for my husband for christmas . it is very funny , but make sure no children are anywhere around when playing it .
this is a movie that will stand the test of time . the movie is entertaining and the music is good ( by the four tops ) but beware of the ending too much cursing .
this show is so well made from setting costumes acting etc . i would recommend it to anyone . watch it while downton abbey is not showing !
not all that much to say . every one knows the movie . if you like it then buy it here . made the wife happy
my favorite show in the entire world ! so glad all the seasons are finally on prime ! ca n't say enough about how happy i am to have it prime finally !
loved the newest of the star trek movies great special effects and the actors did a great job in portraying the star trek tradition to a new generation .
one of my husbands favorite movies ! every now and then we pull this movie out and find it entertaining . one of the reason i ordered it on blu-ray .
my daughter loves this show and asked for the first two seasons so i got this for her . very clever , funny and quirky show , the kind we love !
have always loved this movie . glad i could find a dvd of it . used one i recorded from the tv for years .
thank you so much . i have always enjoyed hobbit movies . you did super and deserve 5 stars . thanks so much
i really enjoyed watching this movie . i rated high because it was just well done and i would recommend it to all !
great storyline , great talents , keeps me on the edge of my seat ! now i understand why its been going on so long , i definitely would recommend !
even with the movies low budget it scared me and my wife more than most big budget films ever have . some of the special effects are a little cheesy but what do expect from a low budget film .
this movie is funny when you watch it and some of the things they said . for the dad in the movie try to find him a wife .
loved it . sure it 's campy now but in it 's day it scared the crap out of me . loved watching this again all these years later . wish the second season was available ... now .
enjoyable original movies by disney . love black and white versions , but i know most people would prefer colorized version . love these type of films .
just a fun movie to watch . i did n't expect a lot when i purchased the movie but it was a fun watch . do n't take it too seriously . it is full of fun and action .
this movie came in great condition as it was advertised . it was shipped quickly and arrived in a good time frame from when i ordered it . i recommend this movie to anyone i can think of .
just a beautiful story follows a life in a touching and sensitive way that is easy to watch and easy to enjoy
despite the mixed reviews , i think this movie is worth watching at least once . i actually liked the movie and ordered it so i could watch it again . i thought it was a good story .
my wife an i liked this movie . it is very similar to pitch black . has a lot of action and weird monsters ...
awesome movie . i laughed through the whole movie . i hope to see a grown ups 3. this was so entertaining .
this dvd shows cop shows from the 70 's . they 're okay , but none of them are shows i 'd want to see again .
bought for my brother . he enjoyed it . he enjoys the older shows and has a big collection of dvd 's and most are of the older movies .
saw this at the movies and everyone in the family loved it so i had to own it . low cost and fast delivery .
some funny parts ( everything you already have seen in the trailers ) but is too long and not funny enough . hoped for more .
i wanted to know more of the story and got it , , , kind of a surprise ending tho ! was it really over ?
this is a great value for two of the best movies of the `` 90 's . '' this is a great choice to purchase for those who collect some of the decade 's best action thrillers .
i love this movie - i love both robert and reese as well as the other main actor in it ( they all did great ) !
cute movie did not think i would like it but was pleasantly surprised ! it kept my attention for the entire movie !
this movie had a good premise , but it was poorly executed . many of the things that happened did n't make a lot sense
awesome short stories , love the art , and creativity . needed to be a little longer for me . look forward to the next one .
i loved this movie and how judy garland played this character . this is when she 's at her best .
my grandson asked my to purchase this item so that he could add it to his collection of classics . he gave it 5 stars .
still one of my favorite movies . the blu-ray looks better than the old dvd . in this time of cgi everything , the movie still holds up .
have not yet had a chance to watch this season . have enjoyed the others so hoping these will be as enjoyable .
this is the first bond movie that i actually enjoyed . i 've never been a big fan of the bond movies
if you 're a dallas fanatic , you 've already purchased the other seasons so why would n't you add this to your collection .
great movie with great stars . had seen it years and years ago and will definitely watch it a few more times . would recommend to anyone .
it is a good movie and it is also nice to see it come to blu-ray . glad i bought it .
this was pretty good movie considering arnold 's age i enjoyed it would recommend had a a good story line but just pretty good
i did n't know what to expect , but the movie was enjoyable and full of excitement , of what you did n't know will come next .
i love action packed movies and this was one . saw taken so wanted to see taken 2 and was very pleased with this one .
not great but then again , a very different jim carrey role . entertaining but difficult to follow .
my dvd has no dvd case im so sad about that , if i had know that i would n't of bought the dvd . but the dvd is good i suppose
i like this series i got into it and i enjoy watching it and my family enjoy watching is a good series
this is a great classic film for the family to enjoy . good plot with all types of twist in the story .
this two part episode is perhaps the high point of the next generation tv series . the story , acting , premise , and blu-ray updated special effects are thoroughly entertaining .
my husband is collecting all of clint eastwood 's films and t v series so we bought this to do that
wow is all i have to say . i started to watch it on bbc and i knew that i would want it for my collection . it is fabulous . i reccomend highly . i loved it ... ...
movie was cute , had some very comical moments . : ) it 's a feel good movie . enjoy ! i did enjoy it and recommend for fun viewing
good cast but the end of movie was not creative . wish i would knew or read the review carefully . sadly !
another good movie , both my wife and i liked it alot . it 's not to many movies that dwayne does is not good
the dvd a different story arrived on time and in excellent condition . i thoroughly enjoyed viewing the dvd . i highly recommend this dvd to anyone who enjoys viewing a romantic film with a different twist .
raw is what this is . eddie at his best . the early days were some of his best .
great actors , great filming on location , tom hanks and julia roberts are profound actors in this great movie . love movies that are based on a true story .
24 hours a season is a great concept , fast paced , has you on the edge of your seat , one hour goes by in a flash .
it is so much fun the hear that some of your favorite actors can really sing and also dance too . they also keep their great character comedy interaction alive . awesome !
product arrived on time and in great condition . have not yet viewed this dvd yet so i can not make an accurate opinion on the content of this dvd .
this movie was right out horrible . not sure , about all these positive reviews . in addition , the acting was bad just as well . the artwork on the front cover is misleading .
the dvd was in excellent shape . the film is outstanding and thought it very interesting and too bad bruce dern did not win an oscar for his performance .
wonderful movie was glad i could find this movie on dvd . excellent quality dvd it 's made to last for years .
good but not great . seemed to move a little to fast but was entertaining . acting was good but not great .
good action movie with good actors as well . a kind of surprise ending with good visuals along the way as well .
this genre is just great for the clothes , the plots or lack of , the entire package ! the stories are fun and funny and these types of movies are a great gift for the sci-fi fan .
i recommend it to watch with friends or family . saw it with the family and they enjoyed it . add it to library
these movies and books are give and take . i think that it could have been a whole lot more . i was really hoping that you guys would have had a package on our hands with this one
... than acting . no academy awards - but enjoyed the story . was more like a documentary . mildly scary . would watch it again .
i am typically not a fan of romantic comedies , but this one is not so bad . although not a favorite movie , it is one i do not mind watching and will watch again .
but they do n't happen so that we can see something amazing and extraordinary . they happen so that we can see someone amazing and extraordinary . watch this movie and see him !
this is by far the best movie ever made . if you 're reading this you already know that ! ! ! yeah baby ! !
if you like romantic mysteries then hart to hart is for you . great actors , good storylines , a must see for those that love the genre .
i rented this movie because there were no others that looked interesting , but it turned out to be pretty funny for the rental ! worth renting
my son watched the movie over and over ! my husband even watched it a couple of times . you should at least watch it once .
i 've had this movie in vhs for a long time so i decided to buy it in dvd so my daughter can watch it with me .
if you 've ever wondered what goes on in the video game world , here it is ! sweet , inspirational and creative . good movie . yes yes . we will probably buy this one .
i finished season 1 and could n't wait to start on the second season . it 's a lot of fun with great characters and a great storyline .
i had not watched this series before . i really do enjoy watching it on my ipad . kinda scary and cool . of course love amazon prime which provides so much to watch .
think everyone has been in question with themselves between what they really want , and what they think they want in life .
i have never seen the movie so the rating is only for the product 's quality . the disc did not work for any dvd player i put it in !
the book was simple and so was the movie . if you loved the book you 'll like the movie . i thought the book was fair and so was the movie .
see my previous reviews of earlier seasons and then understand that it just keeps getting better with each new season .
pride and prejudice is an all time classic . there have been remakes on this film but the original is wonderful .
love it ! i had seen this movie several years ago , and decided to buy it . it is a good story .
not enough to make me watch it twice , but i laughed a lot during it . i would recommend it to a friend .
really brought the famous opera to life in an easy to understand and follow format ! i would recommend this movie ! ! !
what can i say ? there is nothing to say watch it . if your not watching it then your dumb . god i 'm in the wrong line of work !
this is an awesome collection . my kids ages 5 , 4 , and 2 absolutely love the tall tales . highly recommended to all parents who care about what their kids watch .
a great collection of snl holiday skits , with an outstanding cast of characters ! i enjoyed this purchase immensely ! i will be watching this dvd over and over !
if you have nothing to do , you might mildly enjoy this movie . it is not the worst movie i have ever watched , but it is far from the best that i have seen .
these 2 together are hilarious . melissa mccarthy is perfect as the partner to sandra bullock 's character . hope to see a sequel sometime in the future .
nice christmas story . good movie for the romantic and kids . clean movie with no surprises , predictable but cute . it 's great for christmas family movie time .
a great fantasy , combined with a romantic adventure . this is a sleeper that will keep your interest . interesting characters , well played by a fine cast . highly recommended .

its a good series touching stories tells you more about them . i highly recommend to all ages . good for history fans .
this is just great stuff they dont make them like this any more , can not get enough of this type of tv
such a great funny movie ... and not that over the top funny where it starts to get a little awkward .
this movie was well priced and arrived quickly . it was a good addition for my disney movie collection . a very funny movie .
this old movie , is also a well watched movie , so glad we got it on dvd , because our vhs was dead , and its so much better like this love this movie
all of the mummy series i enjoyed . these were the monsters in my younger years . i enjoyed this collection very much .
do n't care for violence and did n't watch this movie with my husband .
classic series from the 90s . rather bad color and art but with such great stories and voice acting , it is still enjoyable to watch today .
this is a very exciting movie with a lot of twists and turns . my wife and i enjoyed the movie very much .
i loved the twist near the end -- made it so dramatic . a great ending to a wonderful series . i highly recommend .
blue-ray really adds to the visual action and enjoyment of the alien series . excellent quality . only negative would be no extras included - just 3 dvd 's in a colorful box .
bought this when vcr were still popular . nice video and audio quality . nice to watch with your friends and family .
the humanity of the two main characters is very heartwarming . the struggle to be free at impossible odds is a triumph of a beautiful spirit .
this was a fun take on a classic show . i watched the original series and loved the movies ' approach . my entire family loved it .
i watched these shows when a kid so i bought them for my kids to see and they loved it .
if you have not seen this flick , this is a great movie for any age . i would recommend this movie to anyone that likes funny movies .
i loved watching this show on television and i recently wanted to watch more of it but it 's now off the air . i decided to buy this and i have n't looked back since !
we found this to be entertaining . we also watched barbie in a mermaid tale ii , and we recommend them both . the animation was good , storyline good .
i think the acting is good . i like seeing a reproduction of how life might have been like back then .
my wife and i very much enjoyed watching this movie . no bad language , no violence . a nice story with a happy ending .
this is a good go to when tv sucks i have watched it many times and its still pretty good , check it out .
what a great movie ! great story and fun movie , very suitable for family movie night . fun for everyone ! loved the characters and the heart behind the story .
my nephew loves this movie . it 's one of his favorites . i do n't even mind watching it over and over again . it was cheap and in great condition which just makes it even better .
this is a darn good , nostalgic flick any little girl or most old ladies would love . i love it and bought this for my granddaughter .
i can watch this with my child or by myself over and over again we even have the cars to the movie
the performances were quite good , the movie was fun to watch . all actors did a good job especially gerard butler , he has good comedic timing .
thank you so much ! was great to finally have one of my favorite movies ! love amazon and so glad i found this movie
this dvd series arrived on time and in perfect condition . this is perfect for our collection . we will definitely buy from this vendor again .
slow start , but the character development , clever plots , and excellent acting made this a favorite by the end of the season
this is an unusual movie . this movie is about this person is a small space craft like machine in a person . this is funny .
this movie was almost impossible to sit through . that is why i have it listed for sale .
i saw this movie when it came out in the 80 's and enjoyed it then . a lighthearted romance with a few laughs , i would recommend it .
excellent video and audio quality . nice story . nice special effects for an animation film . kids would enjoy watching this movie as well as adults .
as i have said before , this series is the best on television . i can hardly wait from one sunday night until the next .
it was only a couple of dollars to buy , so i did ... that is all i really have to say about it ... . lol
this makes the classic story of robin hood come alive ! we all enjoyed it very much ! we highly recommend it !
there are n't a lot of series that i would buy on dvd , but this is one of them . just adding my voice . . .
with all the heavy weight actors in this film , i expected it to be better . it was not a very plausible story .
when i watch these , i am curious as to the real story and characters the author had in mind . good story . not for the faint at heart .
same old stuff here - average special effects with mediocre direction and acting . i watched about half then shut it off .
it was a little dark for me . i had trouble with the subtitles and i really did n't finish it . it is just not my kind of movie .
this movie and the product was absolutely in great timing , quality and everything just was unbelievably good and very affordable !
we did not like this movie at all . it certainly was not a comedy . we would not recommend it at all .
this is my idea of pure light hearted comedy . we have enjoyed every single episode . one of the best ways to end a challenging day with a smile .
my kids love it and i like it very much , we seen it 3 more time in 3 days , that say alot
this is a great show and the storylines are incredible . this is a must-have for any collection big or small .
great movie . saw it years ago but was reminded of it recently . did a lot of research to figure out what movie i was thinking about . loved it : )
great series , love the plots and drama i bought the complete series so i could enjoy it when i wish to stay in or share with my friends
i can not get over how attached i have become to this great actor 's movies . this show what really could happen when our health system fails us .
say what you will about quentin tarantino , the sure knows how to write out some interesting characters and memorable quotes up .
have only watched series 1. the history channel did a very good job of putting together old films of the war . learned a bit in my old age .
not as good as i had expected , but still brought back memories of the family at the theater before we had a tv .
best setting , best writing , best story-line , best acting , best everything ! ! i like this entire series so much - all 3 seasons - that i bought two more sets for my sisters !
this movie is my least favorite of the harry potter movies . it came when i ordered the dvd so its a great deal .
love this movie am going to buy it . as always they rock for action packed movies . a must see ! ! ! !
the series doesnt get funny up until season 5 , so unless you love south park then i wouldnt recommend getting this season
the story begins slowly and it is hard to stay with it until it begins to make sense . in the end it turns out well .
this was just funny from the time it starts to the ending . if you really do n't want to think to hard and just want entertainment this is the movie for you . enjoy
it arrived on time , in good condition i had no problems i would definetly order again , i love the movie its great
great movie . language is old style but something makes it all the greater for it . it is not an action film .
this show has so many stars in it i ca n't even name them all ... one of the funniest movies i have ever seen full of action and crazy antics ... .a must see .
always great laugh on this show . even when they touch on serious adult subject matter , there 's always a laugh to be had .
very intense with a great storyline . worthwhile at a higher price . washington is always good and is in many good films
i always expect something else but it is what it is . i liked it -- loved it no but a enjoyable enough !
it was a very good movie i love it i really recommended to all kind of people i love it
this is not a bad action flick if you have a rainy day and want to see something with a little intensity . but the story and acting could have been a bit better .
the movie has already been out on bluray . enough with a description . someone , please tell me if this edition has a superior picture quality - a better bit rate , more detail , etc .
i have rented this movie from my local library a couple of times as well as seeing it on tv so i decided that it was time to finally own it .
it 's nice to own such a funny series . so far it 's one of our favorites to watch again and again .
i think if i were an american , especially from the mid west , i would have cried a lot . very interesting , well worth watching , or perhaps worth suffering through .
amazing classic that never disappoints . with a dialogue that you want to quote every day . not too dark and just the right amount of humor
portrayed very well , with that and our favorite john wayne , they are great hits . thanks for the good reproduction of these on dvd to replace our vhs 's .
so cheesy but so good ! must-see for anyone who knows what they 're getting and is thrilled by it ! loved it !
i really like this movie . it 's very funny . if you like period movies you 'll love this .
if you like to see actual world war 2 footage , and especially about their youth programs there during that time , then this is a good place to start .
we watched it twice on christmas . a great addition to the series . enjoyable for all ages . nice to see the faces of the voices at the end .
i am happy to have this but i have not had time to view it.i am pleased with it .
was a big fan of this show when i was a teenager . it was good seeing alot of those episodes i remember so well again .
how can you not love this series ? ? ? we have the whole thing on discs and i am sure we will watch it over and over , catching new little twists each time !
i have always liked matlock and hope that they get more seasons to buy online . i will buy them . thanks
this is an old show that was well know in it 's day , and now is not up to date enough to enjoy . we think at my house it is not a film we need .
wow , what a 3-d experience . so realistic you feel the sea monsters are in your living room .
my daughters love this movie ! i would recommend this movie to anyone 's movie collection . this will be a long standing favorite in my house !
this has to be one of the best barbie videos yet ! the color in this was amazingly beautiful , and it was a very good story , i hope there are many more made like this . thanks !
a wonderful classic movie . a movie i love to watch many times . i would definitely buy this movie again .
great service . love the film . hitchcock 's daughter did a wonderful acting job in her father 's film . happy to add this to my hitchcock collection .
this is a very good movie with denzel washington and mark wahlberg . this was very entertaining and fun to watch .
simply put , i liked the movie . it held my interest . i saw the movie twice , so far . a movie is n't good if i ca n't watch it more than once .
just as great and funny with lots of laughter as all the other seasons before it . i really did enjoy it as much as the first 3 seasons .
gritty story . a bit predictable but a must watch for kurt russell fans . strong language used at times in this movie .
i liked this movie . it told you how strong a woman can be if she has to . and she could be what was in her heart !
great movie , definite must see . great cast and storyline . perfect movie for any tom hardy fan . he 's great in this film !
one of the best ever musical productions ! there has never been a time it did n't lift my spirits and make me smile !
i 've never seen the original but thoroughly enjoyed this remake . it had good acting , story and a good sense of humor . it was pretty freaky . i highly recommend it to horror fans .
this was a great way to preview this series , and what it has to offer . i will buy more of these in the future .
i love this show so this dvd set just ranks right up there with greatness .
excellent , well written mysteries about a young detective who has a great deal of integrity and really wants to know the truth . a lot of excellent british actors .
if you have not seen it , stop reading and start watching . yes , it is that good . we 'll written and it never gets old .
it was a good price . i thought it was the new movie but i was wrong . but that is okay . still worth the price i paid
it was humorous and has great actors who portray the characters well , but it was much more sexual than i expected and appreciate .
learned so much about elvis i did n't know , especially his family history . loved it ! a must for elvis fans wanting to know how elvis and events in his life created his character .
love it great disney christmas movie bring tear to my eyes every time i watch great movie to watch all year round
now that the end time has passed i wonder what the value of this is . enjoyable for entertainment though at a good price .
both of my sons enjoy this series . they use to use all of the space on our dvr to record them but now that they have all seasons they are happy and so are we !
if you enjoy these charlie chan films you should consider buying the whole collection as i did . it will bring back so many good feelings of the past .
a must have for any dr. who fan . it was great to see the original footage . wish there was more
love the series , just wish it had more episodes . i would watch it forever if they made it . please make more

so happy . ordered it yesterday , got it today . thank you . got for a great price . i will watch it again and and again . ca n't wait for season 2
just as with the first series , i never tire of these episodes , watching them repeatedly . i just wish there were more than four seasons .
awesome story line - love bradley cooper in this . oh if there really were such a thing and it did n't have side effects
nothing deep here , just gadgets and explosions , good guys vs bad guys , revenge and lost loves . just sit back and enjoy
i love this movie so does my hubby . it is based on true events . it 's a must see movie . you will like it .
this is another super addition to my library . i love these old movies and i will continue to watch them again and again .

since this movie is base in a true life story , is a very talented and performed true events in new york city , love this movie .
blue-ray is the new thing , and sleeping beauty looks perfect , and crisp , and clear . sound is the best , picture is gorgeous and the films is still the best .
this is an awesome movie . the only reason i gave it three stars instead of five is because i 'd like to see it released has a two disc , unrated , special edition set ! ! !
just another set of old westerns . that my dad wanted to watch old men like westerns it played ok ok
great british mystery . my husband is in love with anything british and really enjoyed this .

cool story and you will laugh throughout the movie , the new mean girls of the decade . would recommend to watch
i ca n't give a review of this movie as i have returned it . this was in chinese with english subtitles .
i do n't remember ever seeing this movie before . i really enjoyed it a lot . i recommend it to you if you like disney movies .
fun , light hearted movie . i really enjoyed it . i 'd say it 's more of a feel good chick flick . i enjoyed watching it on my own , without my boyfriend : )
a little slow getting to the story and a bit boring but better than tv not much action going on
he loved it and he watches it in the car as we travel the 50 some miles form his house to mine and then back again

really enjoy the show . i used to watch them years ago and and they are just as great now . the characters work very well together and the show writers know their comedy .
not bad a nice video and i really did enjoy it i like to watch it over and over again
do n't have any idea why they made the movie and the acting could have been much much better if more money had been spent on the making of the movie
a most colorful , entertaining as well as well acted movie . the music was delightful ! good choice of actresses for the three girl 's . a must have for musical lovers . mouse up

as a stephen king fan , i loved this when it was first shown on tv , and i loved it when i watched it again on dvd .
good show hope they keep making them . i like how they go back and forth between countries and how they all play together
four more great world war two movies on one dvd . even though i have seen them on the tv i still ordered the dvd to have on hand if i wanted to see them again .
good movie , say the id story on this . ca n't believe this is an actual story , more so thinking he was going to get away with those events .

my husband loves this movie ! he wanted it in blu-ray . great movie ! a blast from the past ! ! ! a real classic !

white house down was an excellent movie lots of action keeps you on the edge of your seat great cast .
this is a great show , if you do not have this series to date buy it . you will never regret it it is that good .
great series and worth the money for what your going to pay for it 20 bucks for the entire two seasons who would n't buy this
i always liked this movie ... and with the other two , it makes a good set . good story and plot , wish there were more .
it was a great movie when i was a kid and i still think it is a great movie today .
with a world where technology is part of culture , it show 's how family is still a bond stronger than technology . this has to be a must have for any fan of anime .
a good watch , believable with enough twists and turns to keep it interesting . well acted and is one i watch every couple years .
i like watching the old match and see who the fans picked . this one is for any one who like these type of matches .
i used to watch this show as a child when it aired on tv . very funny and original . love the movie also .
they do n't make movies like this anymore , suspenseful , powerful characters , meaningful story line and a delightful look into the pass .
so bad we turned it off after a short time , could n't even find anything to laugh at , which we understood was the appeal of the movie .
uplifting , great story line and excellent acting . decent sound track too . a terrific movie for kids as well as adults .
this video was pure fun . i would recommend it to all of my friends . just might watch it several more times .
dead like me : the complete collection ... .. if you do not like this you have not watched it this is a deal i would never pass up get you will not be sorry
i saw this movie on hbo for the first time years ago and bought it to have in my collection ... .this is a really good female prison movie with twists and turns that will leave you shocked !
always love pixar films . this one is no exception . a great family film with a lesson that everyone can learn from .
i bought this for my wife . she likes the most random movies and this is one of them . we no longer have it .
my grandson loves anything thomas , so this is an add on to his collection . he watches it all the time .
power rangers rule ! this is a great dvd for my kids . i just hope they put all the power ranger movies on dvd .
this was in very good shape and a great concert , i recomend for anyone to purchase . a good deal if used
this was an ok movie . nothing to really write home about . i mainly wanted to watch it because i love john cusack .
it 's a great movie for the whole family . they do n't make them like this anymore . most of the start are gone .
i had watched this movie years ago and enjoyed it very much . considering the subject , the amount of people used , and the time it was made , this is a classic !
i bought this for my niece and she loves it also . i am so happy there is a dvd version is with this blu-ray so she bring it in the car with her .
hell 's kitchen is one of my favorite show love it and am glad i now have the dvd i watch it all the time thank you
this is a charming , feel-good western well-acted by john wayne and katherine hepburn . good dialogue and plot . i highly recommend it ! !
i love these movies . my grandchildren are now also fans . prior to watching these recently they had no idea who he was .
my wife and i found this to be a bit boring and not as good as the first one . and many of the situations were quite unbelievable .
this is a wonderful show about how strange creatures can become friends and help each other . fun family that will make you laugh and maybe cry .
breaking bad is one of the greatest series of all times . the fifth season is great and it helps build to the thrilling next season . you will not be disappointed in this season .
movie was great sad how the girl was treated but the movie was insane hope theres # 3 would so look forward to it
a mini series was the best way to handle this book . an entertaining version that stays true to the spirit of the original story . director 's cut is better than the television version .
i liked watching this series to find out how its going to end ! very exciting events happened and you can never guess what 's the next move to either the police or the gang ! very nice
this was a very good but complicated film . you need to see this one twice .
also have the book . very good movie , although a little different from the book in a few areas i thought were significant .
a good comedy with a heart , even if from very & # 34 ; rough & # 34 ; old guys . not good for an audience under 16 .
this was not a new movie but i had not seen it previously . there are some pretty good scenes and some that could have been better . the overall product was a good movie worth watching .
this traditional old disney movie so touching and loving and sad all rolled up into one . family all love it .
i really loved this show . wondering if there will be a part three . donald sutherland was brilliant as always . loved it .
love this series . one of my favorite ! very addictive though . i watch one , and then i have to watch the next one . love it , and so will you !
it 's a movie that i thought i knew right at the beginning what was going on but a nice surprise it took a nice turn .
this is a very good movie , this is one movie that will keep you guessing on who the killer is . it is action packed and an all out good thriller .
i liked this movie because it had jeff bridges in it felt like we were watching men in black so it was great .
you will see mostly hardy boys but nancy drew helps them a lot . holds you in suspense . better then newer shows for kids and adults .
great story and well filmed . good to watch on a rainy day . the four stars are for the & # 34 ; fun factor & # 34 ; .
i really enjoyed watching this film . it is good entertainment and jake did a great job as usual .
this movie was very moving as was the novel . i very much enjoyed both of them . i love the actresses that were in it .
bought this for my son he is trying to get all seasons . came in a timely fashion and at a good price .
you just got ta love tina ! watching her on stage or listening to her cd 's will make you smile , buy this dvd ! ! ! ! !
i have always loved this series . i am so glad that it is now for sale . i have all but two seasons . i will purchase them as soon as i can .
received dvd in great shape and was well packaged , this is one of my favorite actors , and i have a lot of his movies .
good animation ; good story ; good interaction between the bear and wahlberg . i liked it for creativity , but it could have been written stronger , for more funny .
even though i do not have young children , i decided to rent this movie . i loved it . a good lesson to learn ... love and respect your mother !
gift for the wife ! her favorite star , richard gere is in it . she said it had a great story line . wwii
again hugh jackman gives us another view of the wolverine . as to be expected , fast paced and plenty of action . if you liked the x-men series and the previous wolverine movie you wo n't be disappointed .
i loved this movie . if i could trade places with jane for a short time i would do it in a minute ! what a great idea this movie is . a must see for any austin fan .
got it in the mail , case slightly damaged , but it looks like normal wear and tear . very happy with it , thanks so very much
good twist on the old movie , but i did not like the new khan . but i did like the new story and the rest of the movie .
was looking forward to watching this move and i am glad i got it . the family really like the movie a lot of fun to enjoy .
this is a ready made scream fest ... got ta have it , got ta have it all !
as remakes go this was terrible , the orginal is far better , the remake is so-so , the back ground music is better and that about the only good thing about the remake ,
i have read the story many times but seeing this film really made it come alive . the film made a huge impression on me and i thought the whole thing was very well done .
strange little movie , but i enjoyed it . if you have prime it is worth seeing it for free , but i would n't spend the money at red box for it .
i have n't seen this movie before , bought it without knowing exactly what it was about , and i 'm glad i did ... disc is in perfect condition as promised and it was such a good movie
this was a favorite of my own children . we watched it together and had the best time remembering better days . i could n't believe how much the main actors had n't change !
book was fabulous and i had high expectations for the movie . perhaps if i had n't read the book i would have given this movie 5 stars instead of only 4 .
seeing these 3 together again and hearing their songs , which sound as good as ever , is a gift . now that mary is gone , especially , fans will appreciate the performance .
so happy i could purchase this set ~ amazingly funny shows & lots of good memories watching them as a kid !
great writers and great actors ! this show is so perfectly put together . just ca n't have enough of it . freaking fantastic ! ! !
great film one of the classic westerns would reccommend for any one 's library of western films or horses and cowboys
i collect dvds of shows that i enjoy watching . although i received this later than season 7 , it was in good condition .
great series . i have all of them from the beginning and enjoy them all . i will keep ordering them if anymore come out
what a devil of a man . this movie says it all and the actors do very well to keep the audience engaged .
this movie could have been better . it was okay and i did get to see some action in this movie .
if you are looking for a good movie with a good message , this is the movie for you . it has a good , subtle christian message . our family really enjoyed this movie .
i enjoyed watching this christmas , this movie has the perfect cast and a funny story line . this christmas reminded me of my family on the holidays . a good movie to watch anytime of the year ! !
can it really be christmas without watching this wonderful movie . we have a family tradition . we watch it every year .
great so fun ! loved it ! really enjoyed it ! fresh and fun ! still great even after al these years ! loved it !
needless to say , i love it . im currently on season 4 and know that i will be disappointed when it all comes to an end .
my wife is a huge fan of this series and somehow this season went missing . so ordered replacement only to find a week later . that aside very good show highly recommend .
i decided it was time to purchase this film . we watch it every time it comes on so now we can see it any time we choose .
without giving up too much , just in case you want to see it . the movie was ok , most of what was going on took me by surprise
the book series were even better , but the movies were great , too . i do believe we own the entire story now , and we never tire of watching this movie in any order .
this is a very enjoyable movie . the acting is excellent . the only problem i have is that the movie drags a little at times , but when the action picks up you are glued to the screen .
i wanted more after viewing the entire series . it is such a good story and i enjoyed every minute of it . highly recommend
it had a great twist that i wasnt expecting . had to keep watching it due to the story , pretty good !
got this for my husband for christmas . he loves this show and was very excited to get season 1 and 2 for christmas .
you ca n't go wrong with scooby doo - it is fun for all the family . i watched with the kids and felt like a kid again .
liked the series , but just 2 seasons , it get you and thats it , i have both seasons , just disappointed it ended . eve
loved every minute of it . british comedy is so funny and serious at the same time . still watching some of them .
i wish they actually kept this thing running ! today 's cartoons are mildly entertaining in comparison !
this is a must see . comedy , drama , action , suspense , educational , you really ca n't ask for more in a series that touches on the reality of family life .
it is one of the best movies i had seen back in the day , everyone needs to see this movie
both actors at their & # 34 ; subtle & # 34 ; best . extraordinary chemistry among the actors . you know some of these people . 1 , 2 , 3 .
even after all of these years , this film is still wonderful . a must for all who miss him still . brings back many memories of watching it the first time !
another great old classic had to add it to my collection . winner of 3 academy awards including best picture . include some of the great actors and actress and i am good to go . loved the movie .
sleeping beauty is probably my favorite disney princess , and i absolutely love the music in this film . it 's another must-have disney movie !
this is so much better than the remakes . only fault would be wish they had stayed more with the book .
i am a huge fan of action anime and naruto has plenty of action and a good story . there are funny characters and good morals : ) a great anime for teens to adults : )
it is great series and have more to watch of the series . will watch more at a later time . like it
this is a fun movie to watch . not all that realistic but fun . yes , i would recommend this movie to someone who just wants to be entertained .
i am a 007 fan . this one was ok by my standards so i give it 5 stars .
it was just ok. i had to force myself to watch the whole movie at one time . i 'm sure some people really enjoyed it .
i gave the film two stars because it provided some entertainment . there was some humor in the story , but i did not care for the storyline
my grandchildren loved it and so did i ! i would recommend it for everyone in the family but maybe a little scary to very young children .
sequels have been known to become rather stupid . but this & # 34 ; iron man 3 & # 34 ; delivered well . pretty action packed with humor and a twist .
i liked the movie . it was slow in parts but not too bad . not sure i would buy it or watch it again , but i did like it .
the first was kinda funny in spots , but painful to watch the rest of the season . i kept thinking it would get funny , it did n't . do n't waste your time on this season .
this movie is incredible , anyone that is a fan of westerns should see this movie as well as the first one because they are awesome !
action packed and full of suspense ! excellent cast ensemble . i have already recommended this movie to quite a few friends .
we have watched this one several times now ... .very very good and did not expect the ending which ended up good anyway ... .
the cutting edge first going for the gold movie dvd is my favor i love sweet is my favor sweet i love sweet .
love it and kids do too . they do n't make them like that anymore ! great find and also a great price !
it 's an okay movie . would recommend it to a friend . also , watched on amazon instant video great product and service .
i love monster movies . the story is a good one . the actors and monsters will keep you watching . i even got some of my friends to watch it . they also enjoyed it .
the pace of the movie is quite slow but it 's nice . light up , sit back , and enjoy .
the quality was great and it was nice to get to see this movie in it 's true form once again .
i would recommend this drama series - it 's interesting and the characters are believable . it 's set at the beginning of world war 2 .
it was ok. nothing i would watch with the family . the picture and sound from the stream were very good . just not that great of a movie
excellent series , even better without the long commercials ! a must have for any present or future monk fan .
great cast and non-stop action . glad i rented it . this movie makes it 's sequel , & # 34 ; red 2 & # 34 ; an absolute must see .
i was very surprised after watching this show . it was very excellent and also had very good acting . hated to see it end .
our grandchildren loved this dvd . they watch it even during the summer months . probably because santa is fun every day of the year
love jason statham , he is handsome and a great actor this movie is different from his others but its still has action in it with his amazing fighting scenes .
saw the movie , but needed to have the dvd . it arrived the same day as the release and when i watched it , i realized i had forgotten much of it .
this movie was not quite what i expected . not worth the money as far as i am concerned . others may think differently .
wow ... love old movies ... this was deep , intense , and she had the last laugh in the end ! wow again ! highly recommended if you like old mysteries !
this is a wonderful video , with good lessons and no evil characters . really wonderful . i also enjoy watching it ! my 8 and 9 yr old girls love it .
i give this movie 5 stars for the cinematography alone . i found the plot engaging and the acting excellent . you really feel like you are watching real life .
loved it . my granddaughter and i have watched it at least three times . it 's such a tender story between sisters .
grand kids love this and surprisingly so does my husband . ( me too ) . we watch is frequently when they come . a good addition to our cd library .
i 'll just be frank about it . it was n't very good . i like movies that really pull you into the story and i just felt bored with this one .
the dog is fantastic ! the actors , ok. the story line , ok. good movie for the kids seeing good versus evil , with good winning in the end .
surprisingly good . very funny throughout . well paced , it never feels like you 're waiting for something to happen . very well acted and cast .
the 3d image was sharp , and the sound was awesome . this was a good but at a good price along with a good dvd . who could ask for anything more .
it was a good movie and i enjoyed it . having hugh j and kate b in a movie makes it better .
as usual meryl streep and liam neeson are really great in this movie . the plot is simple but interesting enough for the viewer to want to get involved in the story .
another great movie at the time i 've enjoyed . along with the original black and white feature , i 've truly enjoyed seeing it in color , i 'm happy to have the best of both worlds .
what can i say . it is by far the best movie . we watch it when we can . good to add to the shelf
this was one of audrey hepburn 's best movies . we watched it again and were just as happy . thanks to the vendor for their great service .
it does enough to keep you interested and you wo n't be looking at your watch . the plot is simple , you get an idea of what will be happening next but it 's not overly predictable .
this series is extremely educational and lots of fun . we 've been watching it since my son was about 4 ( he 's six now ) and we still watch it .
thought this was going to be a good wholesome movie . if you have values than you might not want to get this . was very disappointed in it .
there was too much hype about this movie . the special effects and 3d were great . the story just sucked it was very dull and slow paced .
these jesse stone movies are excellent ... tom selleck is perfect for the lead ! ! ! ! the story line makes you think , music is good ! !
this is such a great and amazing show i wish i would have gotten it sooner . i would recommend it to anyone who would like an anime with a story .
our youngest daughter loves scooby doo , just as i did when i was her age . it was a wonderful feeling to sit and watch these mysteries with her .
i cant believe i didnt watch this on tv when it aired but oh well i can watch 2 or 3 episodes at a time now ! love the drama and suspense
i liked the movie . mark and the rock are funny ! ! ! ! the fact that it is a true story kinda make you think how accurate the movie is
my grand children love it . a lot of action to keep their attention . it was sent in great condition to us .
very good deal . seen the show on cartoon network and really liked it . the whole season in one package . a great steal for the price .
there is so much to be said about this film , but i do n't want to spoil it . it went inside the regret a parent must feel when their child does something against society .
i love this movie so much . it is so good and keeps you interested constantly . i recommend it to everyone !
my little boy loves this movie and i think it was a great sequal to the first ! it made the decision to purchase the blu-ray version so much easier !
kept my interest through the whole movie , pretty sad movie but makes you think about things that can happen . i have recommended this movie to friends and family .
dvd 's are standard dvd 's and packaging is typical for a box set . i can say i really hate the commercials for their other dvd 's at the beginning of this one and all the others ...
ordered it based on a recommendation . it was a good movie even though somewhat brutal when it came to working with people
okay movie , a little hokey and slow at times but entertaining enough . not at all realistic but what movie is these days ?
very intense believe able movie about jesus christ . even though it is subtitled , it 's easy to understand what 's going on . another must see ! !
did n't seem to stick as closely to the book as the others , but then a good amount of time has passed since i read the book
great series , unfortunate that it only ran for a season or two . would of liked to have seen more , and at the price on sale it was a great steal in my opinion .
my family loves this movie . it is very funny and the characters are a joy . we 've watched it a couple of times already .
if you are a johnny deep fan this is a great pirate movie for your collection . it was sent to me on time and packed well very pleased
i love this movie , it 's different and not like all the others . the whole thing is just fun . the actors , the story , all of it is amazing !
this is a great old movie that we watch over and over . has a lot of twists in the plot and enjoyable through the years .
i bought this for my 10 year old son after he would see it playing at the comic book store . he loves it !
many thanks for your prompt service , it was good to see this video once more , good to know i have this for later !
loved this movie . took awhile to find it but was well worth the search . i dont think my kids enjoyed i as much as i did . lol
i 'm a huge john candy fan , this movie is one of my favorites of his . i guess you ca n't go wrong with both pryor and candy .
my mother loves this movie ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
i finally got the last one to add to my collection i have the whole set of the three stooges , vol . 1 to 8
i got this one for my father and he love it . i enjoy see it too . any one who is a daniel craig fan will like this one .
this movie was a joke . it was about these different people who all had problems and it just did n't do it for me
ca n't say enough about the roseanne seasons of shows . just a great bunch of shows to really make you think and give you a laugh as well .
i am such a fan of the old musicals . music , costumes and the acting , what a great way to spend time .
good story line , and kept my attention right up until the end . this one was n't as boring as i thought it might be .
this was a good program when it was on , i tried to watch when i could , it has great acting , lot of action if you like this type of show .
good movie , great action scenes . jason statham keeps making good movies . good storyline , better acting and action . suprised me with how good it was compared to my low expectations .
i especially liked the acting in this movie . sutherland was good . the ending left you hanging and wanting more . but other than that , good entertainment .
i love this series ! it is well written and the actors are great ! keeps you interested from start to finish .
my family really enjoyed this movie over the thanksgiving holidays . it is not for small children . all the adults were laughing so much after the kids went to sleep .
this is a great movie , one i can enjoy more now that surround sound and large tv 's are around . an oldie but a goodie : )
we enjoyed the film very much . visually very good with good acting . the animation was smooth , and the graphics were excellent .
glad that this movie was true to real life . also was pretty funny so i 'd definitely watch it again ! highly recommended !
this is one of my grandchildren 's favorite movies . well made and graphics are realistic . i would recommend this to others .
maybe they are old and some say outdated , but my grandchildren are totally enthralled with these movies . way to go , the peanuts gang still lives !
same jokes same actors same hilarious product . if you have enjoyed seasons one through nine then season ten will not disappoint .
nice family movie . gentle , emotional and touching . when you feel like a nice quiet evening and there is nothing on amazon prime provides this .
i cant say more , but this movie is really worth it . arnold is really cool
acting good , story ok but it is based on true story . people can not find this in netflix .
it worked great no problems . it is a great dvd . . . . . . . . .
come on its the classic batman flicks that was bad a $ $ and did n't need much work as the movies we have now too much computer graphics . excellent buy for movie collectors !
matlock has been in reruns forever but you ca n't beat a good show . never get tired of watching this show .
i purchased this to complete my set and was thrilled with its quality and faithful rendition of the story . a very good purchase .
really great story for young and old . i 've bought several copies to share with others !
a tear jerker for sure . enjoyed the movie and have shared it with others and they have positive comments on it
the series is great i have ordered thru you the entire set . i also have the first sex ad the city . this is great
this stuff never gets old ! great writing and it sure is nice seeing all the old familiar faces ! yes , it 's dated , but fun !
great fiction movie that nonetheless guess you thinking about the impact the human race has on nature . a must watch .
i have always loved this movie and watch it at least once a year . i wanted a blu-ray copy and boy does it deliver ! great service too !
i have not watched it yet , but i love all these midsomer murders programs . i have about 14 sets so far and will most likely continue buying them until there are no more to buy .
not quite as good as the first one but still a good movie . i really ca n't think of a film he has made that i did not enjoy .
i bought this movie as a gift . i had looked in several other places for it with no luck , got ta love amazon !
a classic teen comedy ! a very well written film with a great cast . if you have n't seen this one yet , it 's long over due !
service was all it should be but the video was not great . it does not keep my son attention while i am driving which most videos do .
i really enjoy this tv series , one of few that actually gets me to laugh at times . in fact this is my second go at watching the complete series .
it was not an award winner , but well acted , directed and written . i recommend it . the dog fights are fun to watch and the plot is a good one too .
this was a good & # 34 ; movie night & # 34 ; pick . it held my attention throughout with lots of drama and suspense . i would recommend it to my friends .
great movie ! i picked this up just based on the positive reviews and i was not disappointed . anyone who picks this up is in for a treat .
pretty close to the bible account . i bought it to interest others in the bible and a movie is easier to get them to watch than a documentary .
loved the ending - although i think i 'm still confused by it lol . . . .. . . .
the dvd box set was a gift i gave to some one they seem to enjoy it so i guess it was good
loved the dvd and the price was right for me appreciate that very much ! ! . keep up the good work . amazon is a great place to shop .
slow moving , boring , the screen always seemed dark , i kept thinking they would eventually turn up the light . i love period movies , but this was a disappointment .
this is a great series -- wonderful actors ! ! ! ! my husband and i really enjoyed watching season one . you are left guessing what will happen next . not predictable really and i like that .
good comic book on screen , but i suppose i just could not keep my interest in this film . i am sure younger viewers may like this more .
the writing and acting are excellent as is the storyline . we will continue to watch this show . missed it the first season and are enjoying now
enjoyed both movies . good to sit and watch a movie without sex , violence and foul language .
watched this movie last weekend with family and everyone loved it , both adults and children . highly recommend for any family movie night .
for some reason it stopped playing half way thru movie then i tried to play and it showed i need to buy it again . i think there is something wrong with this instant movie
this was an amazing and some what ground breaking show . please bring this series to either dvd or even better - streaming ! there is money to be made so there has to be a way !
good movie just to kick back and enjoy for what it is . just a fun picture and well done .
i brought this movie to replace my vhs and i was looking for this in dvd . i found it here and the prices was right . it arrive on time . i like those kind of action movie .
great movie ! my daughter loves it and so do i. its well worth the price and a great movie to start a dora collection of movies .
this movie was very unique in the clint eastwood way . he had good supporting actresses & actors which played their parts well .
great movie . creative plot . laughs for adults and kids . i was thoroughly entertained throughout ! forgot what it was like to see a fun movie .
not as good as book , but , what movie is actually as good as the book , the ending needed to be done with a bit more understanding of the books ending .
purchase was great . robert downey , jr. is great in this movie . i plan to buy the next movie too . love the movie .
jennifer lawrence is fabulous ! was n't sure i 'd like the story , but it was very well done & i did enjoy it .
i bought this just for the bonus material . i love it . i think that every dvd should include a lot of bonus material . sometimes it 's the best part of the movie .
this movie is great ! exciting and thrilling . i love matthew mcconaughey 's performance . i would definitely suggest others watch this movie !
great to see it again after all these years and the dvd extras were just wonderful . five stars to a well deserved release . thanks .
this movie is part of a series . great movie and is a good family movie . i highly recommend the entire series to all age groups .
you just got to have it - being a collector - they are enjoyable for my opinion that is -
i had an old copy of this movie from cable . it is nice to get a good original at fair price not outrageous .
saw this movie on tv first and knew immediately that we needed a copy . a super movie for all to see .
this sequel was done just as well as the first . it was also entertaining for the children as well as the adults .
i all way 's like family guy , it is a funny show , its my best show that i like it is funny .
definately not for kids ! we watched the season in 1 week and enjoyed the story . ordered season 4 ( on the waiting list ) .
this has been a favorite for a lot of years . i enjoy this version over the newer one with tom cruise although it is okay as well . thanks
we love this movie . the good guys win and the villain loses in the end and is really a good joe in the end . i think this is one of doris day 's better movies .
the film was very interesting . and it just goes to show that one person can make a difference for good .
it was well edited , exciting scenes , good actors and just really good sci-fi fun . i will watch it again and again
you can tell its a lower budget , but it is still pretty good . i did n't feel like it was one of those home movie types of horror films . it definitely has some strong points .
the show has a natural feel to it . in other words ; they seem or at least try to keep it real . i would recommend viewing for anyone .
as with all of the mission impossible movies i found this to be exciting and full of action . all of the actors/actresses did a fantastic job as always .
i really like the entire sixth season quality production and good action pack by all means , so i really like it and my wife really like the series ; for i bought it for her .
oh my god i loved this movie i laughed and i cry you have to watch this movie it is about life giving and taking those ladies had so much power
i liked party of five since it first aired on television . it reminds us that all families have issues but it is also this same family that is always there for you in the end .
i just watched the first episode and now i am hooked . it 's so interesting how the story plot goes . i look forward to every episode .
this is a love story , and the bonus is keanu reeves , i love this movie , it is such a feel food movie . fast shipping , great price ... ... worth every penny .
at long last a movie that lives up to it 's name . i watched it back to back two times ... stop reading and go watch this fun movie .
i love this dvd it is so funny and all of my family loved it as well , and the price was good as well
i loved this show when it was on air , and i am enjoying it just as much now . in this age of reality tv it 's nice to watch something creative , and witty .
i enjoyed the characters . it is sensitive and funny at the same time . themes did begin to get a bit predictable and repetitive .
the premise was interesting , but i thought there were some major holes in the plot . i like this type of genre , but this particular movie was a bit disappointing .
i was n't pleased with the couple selection . chemistry lacked and they did n't compliment one another . younger actress holds her own but the older one had the wrong part .
lots of twists to the point that you do n't know what is real and what is a dream . kept me interested .
i bought this video series for my wife and she absolutely loves it . this series was one of the best english comedy series for the bbc .
very sad and depressing as the characters lack hope and morality . could only finish half the movie . not a good use of your time .
this is always a go to if we ca n't find anything to watch on tv . old movie but a good one .
product arrived in new condition . i love the sg-1 series and this was a great way to complete my collection .
pretty long , glad i rented and watched the movie at home . thought the movie would be better but it was just ok .
great story , the harry potter series movies have been more faithful to the books than any movie remake i have seen .
it a mind game movie , you have to pay attention to the movies to understand it . it 's a good movie to have .
this was such a great movie . it is a similar story to october baby . it will touch your hear . a great family movie !
arrived on time and in perfect shape . i never thought i would like this one but it turns out that this movie is hilarious .
a classic . . . wonderful . . . wonderful . . . wonderful . . . i highly recommend it .
one of the worst movies i have ever seen , makes the blair witch project look good !
would have been good i think bruce willis is an excellent actor i think i have seen this movie only from tv . thank you
grew up on this movie looked for it everywhere on dvd , found this one and actually gave it as a gift , still need my own copy !
this was a fun movie and lots of action it was a good second movie to the first . hope you enjoy it
great movie . strong , dramatic . different insight on addiction . never boring . must watch if you like personal stories . denzel did an amazing job .
my wife loves this movie so decided to purchase it on blu-ray and it wasnt that bad of a price for this movie . ca n't wait to see it again but in blu-ray instead .
i looked forward to this movie and was terribly disapointed . the movie was 1 hour too long , the special effects were weak , and over the top . wait for it to come out on cable
i loved this low key romance . kristen scott thomas is an actress that i do n't love ( even though she is really good ) ... but in this movie she was so funny !
this 3d movie is awesome and is going to make a great gift for the movie buff in our family .
my 7 year old grandson just love to watch anime and he is starting to collect , this is his first and he watches it constantly
the mini series itself is amazing and very well done . the product in general came in perfect condition with a good case and everything in it . would definitely recommend this product .
this is one of those flicks that comes on tv now and then . i always seem to make time for it . good acting and a good story line .
it 's a classic . hard not to love it . had to get it so that my nephew could watch it at my house when he comes over . ; )
this blu-ray dvd has a very clean picture and sound . also this movie is funny and well written . would recommend ! ! !
this is a crazy movie and it is not for kids . it well have you on the edge of your seats after the movie is finish .
long movie , but well acted and engaging . good story . the ending is not what i expected having never read the comic book series .
this is a great movie , it 's how we wish we could act around people , without a care in the world .
heard this movie got horrible reviews so i thought i would check it out . it was funny and a good movie
this is one of my all time favorite movies ! i am so glad that i found it on amazon for such a reasonable cost .
it was ok , i was hoping it would have been better though . it was worth the money for an evening 's entertainment , but not something we 'll watch over and over .
the movie is like this review . nothing there . after watching it , i was mad at myself for wasting the time to watch it . do n't waste your time .
i think the dog soldiers made for an intelligent werewolf movie . there were creepy parts , with lots of suspense , and likable characters . if you like werewolf movies , you will love this one .
i saw this in the theatres and bought it when it came out on dvd and had to rent it so i could show some people at work . they all loved it of course .
another classic stallone movie to which i highly recommend that you people should go out and buy for your kids
this is a fabulous family movie . it has comedy , romance , but the most important fact is that is great for the family during the christmas holiday season .
so very well done . we enjoyed watching this collection . i know we will probably watch it again . we enjoyed it so much we bought a set as a gift for someone we love .
one of my favorite stories of an old house as a kid , now watching it as an adult a little different because of the filming , but acting still fine .
this is a wonderful dvd on addiction . i am showing it at a family support group . it is a great tool .
will have to watch again to see if i can figure it all out . very long and i think i fell asleep . must have to watch it earlier in the day
x-men was a good movie . perfect summer action flick for teenagers to see with their friends . ca n't wait for the next movies .
i remember watching this program when it was on television , and it 's just as funny today as it was then . very funny and worth watching if you enjoy some silliness .
arrived as promised and was in great shape really happy with the dvd and it is a great movie a really great choice for our collection and a great price .
the trailers made us think it was a comedy and it was not . the acting was good but the story was depressing .
a fun funny movie for kids . my little brother enjoyed laughing through this movie and loves to watch it . 4 stars
kept me interested and glued to the set . great cast and plenty of action . would recommend for an entertaining evening
again , when my wife is happy , i am happy ... i get my wife all the marvel movies when they come out . she is a serious marvel fan .
these are three wonderful mysteries ... i am just sorry that the entire mystery woman series is not available on dvd ... hopefully soon ?
it depicts the time period perfectly for what women were going through . it is not a family film , more for adults .
this is a movie that my wife grew up with and i was able to purchase it and surprise her . it is one of her favorites and i have to be honest i find it heart warming and funny
another fast paced , but i think , the least interesting , of the bourne trilogy . still , it is another very good movie , if you like action and intrigue .
nice to see a series that does n't have blood and gore ! well sometimes blood and doc martin does n't like blood either !
happy to find this one . it is one of my wife 's favorite movies . happy to add it to our collection .
it 's a good movie for kids . my six year old grand daughter loved it . she was laughing through the whole thing .
this is a good insight into the bourne creation . i expect to see more of these . jeremy renner is great .
i was surprised , clint eastwood work is generally good . not this time . x x x x x x x x
it came quickly and was in great condition . i ca n't remember if it was used or not but if it was it looked and worked like new .
good concept but i was disappointed with the lack of chemistry with the leading characters .
so glad i found this , made my christmas ! i never see this on tv and my kids even remembered watching it too . made us all very happy !
usually scooby is a house favorite but this movie would not keep my children engaged at all . i feel that we are avid scooby fans but this is no where close to the movies .
this is a fun ride . it has characters that pull you in . this movie can make you crack up , cry and want to sing the next minute . my family loved frozen and so did i !
this is a good movie that keeps your interest and is n't predictable . my boyfriend and i really enjoyed it . lots of action , chase scenes and suspense .
this is a great family movies love it and my kids love it to got it for a great price came fast love amazon
i love disney animated movies . this is one of the best . i really like the music . i would recommend this movie to anyone .
good story and the actors do a great job -- a must see . lots of adventure ! some violence , but no bad language , which is a plus , these days .
this is an important chapter in american history and i think everyone except small children should watch it . to top it all off the movie was very well acted .
grown ups 2 was even better than grown ups and it 's a dvd you will watch many times over . get ready to laugh !
wow love this movie from disney , and all the stars who are the voices of the dinosaurs , i loved it , wow ! ! !
just loved this film , after watching it 3 times i purchased a copy , its funny , well made , good actors , and a good storyline . well worth a second viewing .
i enjoyed the old shows and the movie . this one is a great one to get if you are a fan of the show .
great buy for a great price , discs are in great condition and i am huge fan of the show so that is all a plus ! ! !
this movie does not require much description or explanation , if you are a movie collector , then this is a must .
great great movie . watch it every time it is on the television cable channel and took it with me on vacation .
i love the view ( and the story ) of the island . it 's played by 2 top actors .
with keaton at his best this is a movie that you will want to watch over and over ! great cast starring in it ! !
of course , alice in wonderland is crazy and colorful and full of adventure . the scenes are cute and young children enjoy this classic .
i 've started watching this movie twice now , and it is so slow , that i am having trouble getting into it . i hope this week that i can get thru the whole thing .
the sets and period clothes are still top notch . the plot is beginning to feel a bit repetitive . still good tv , though .
i loved this series when i was a kid . when i saw it online i just had to buy it .
my friend requested this for her birthday . it 's one of her all-time favorites . she said the acting is great and the story is great .
funny , enough said . this movie is even better than the first ! and they really should 've stopped here . the condition of the case was good and there were no skips in the movie .
this dvd should be watched by everyone who is married or who might want to be married someday .
an above average b horror sci-fi movie . a great movie for older teens on a rainy saturday . lots of action and a bit of unnecessary violence .
typical of sequels , but fun to see after all these years of not knowing there even was a sequel . has it really been that long ? ? ?
this is one of my all time favorites ! i dont have alot of movies on blu-ray but this one makes any collection seem complete !
i have never seen any movie that is steven king that i really did not like . i did not watch this yet but the condition is great .
i watched in television all this program and i found a good price in amazon . i recommend if you want to have a piece of the best musical .
the action was good but i hate subtitles on these type of movies i wish amazon prime will come out with a way to change it to english
this movie teaches kids how to be better friends . another great disney film . our entire family loves it !
halloween is my favorite movie series . these are great movies ! we watch them about every october at least . michael myers is one of my all time favorite movie characters
in the simpsons the complete second season there are 22 episodes . it also has the best dvd extras that i have ever seen .
a very unique and beautiful story of a good family , you can see what was then and what is now . i really like the story , great video .
beautiful story , with a predictable little twist , but that did not spoil the plot . this is one funny , witty and very erotic movie . i enjoyed every minute of it .
i am a big fan of british series and this one fills the bill perfectly . drama , comedy and love all rolled into one
i 've been buying the seasons for my wife and she could n't be happier . now that she has them all she can go back and watch her favorites .
nick cage has stolen another couple hours from me . i ca n't help i just ca n't & # 34 ; put the bunny back in the box & # 34 ; .
i enjoyed this movie and found myself laughing throughout the whole thing . there were a couple parts that were n't as exciting as others but i would still highly recommend this . the whole storyline was great ! !
one of my favorite films , this dvd was a terrific addition to my film library and i 'd strongly recommend it to everyone .
this is a cute movie and we 've seen it many times . it is a classic and if you like billy crystal , you 'll find it funny and heart warming .
this is the one and only best version of the christmas carol on video . i would highly suggest if you like the story to purchase this version . you wo n't regret it .
i thought the movie was great , acting wise , but the plot kind of fell off towards the end . well written script but i wish there was a bit more to it than the way it ended .
i enjoyed watching it , however my grand kids got bored and took off to play . if you like cat in the hat , this one will be good too .
absolutely hilarious ! it does n't take religion seriously nor does it bad mouth religion . it just makes you look at things a little differently , which is what a good comedy does . i love it !
i bought this season used , and it came out good , everything played well . all the dvds played really well , none of them skip .
i would n't call the 2 hours a waste of time , but i know this is not a movie i will watch again .
do n't really see much of a difference from a regular dvd or a blu-ray but either way it 's a good movie !
this felt like is not at all going with all the rest of bourne movies and with ending be so open , we all agree this was just very poorly made
if you enjoy christmas then you must have this in your christmas move collection . this is a timeless family movie that is just a must have .
the first season was fantastic ! ! ! i enjoyed watching the interaction between the characters . the show is much better than the actual book !
this is one of perry 's movies that i enjoy quite a bit . i 've watched it a few times , and i 'm sure i 'll watch it some more .
we love them . the films are hilarious and quality historic entertainment that i share with my family and friends . new does n't always mean better .
i think this is one of the best movies and cher and nick were outstanding in it as were all the actors
i ordered this dvd and it was just what they said in good working order and clean no skips at all i had it with in one week very fast process and i will buy from them again
the kids love this . they received it as a gift and were so excited . it has four episodes . so far , it is a big hit !
good movie not as good as the first in the series but was okay . i do recomend it to friends .
a little too long , drag a bit . not as good as the last one . but still good action movie with wonderful graphics and animations .
i love the movies that disney puts their name on . they do a great job making family friendly movies . enjoyed watching it
a thrilling cold war story written by one of the great cold way spy thriller writers of all time . the move does the book justice , excellent cast . thrilling to the very end .
purchased this for a friend . this is the type of thing he like to watch and he was very happy with it . thank you !
the story was ok , but not intriguing . the act was terribly poor and boring . i can not understand how this pilot made it .
just right for grand children during moving time or taking trips in a vehicle . holds their attention quite well and not very many scary scenes .
i had this movie once before but we lost it in the move now i have it again and have watched it 4 times already !
the rock just keeps on getting better , i love the action and the plot of this movie , not to many low spots , great watching
this is a movie that is worth watching . it is very suspenseful and will keep you on the edge of your seat .
three 's company has alway made me laugh . i wish there were more episodes on the dvd though .
this is such a good movie ! i remembered watching it as a kid , and when i saw the great price , i had to get it . i 'm so happy i have it now !
this was n't even close to the book . i understand that the book is usually always better then the movie , but this was just bad ...
great blu-ray love watching tom and jerry on the big screen rate the blu-ray five stars it is worth it
we got 4 & 5 for christmas and have not gotten to 5 yet . we have the 2nd disc to go in series 4. this is a great series and wish there were more .
classic chevy chase comedy . i do n't know what to say other than this . if you like chevy chase comedy , then you 'll like this movie . watch it , you wo n't regret it .
these are both typical chuck norris movies . i really enjoy these and would purchase them again . these were good quality dvds .
this is hollywood at its best . story , acting and direction all working together to make a memorable and touching film based on a true story .
i was quite taken with the series and learned so much about ireland in general . the characters were well developed and i loved the story line . could n't stop watching it . recommend it to all .
i loved watching this movie when i was younger and i still love it today !
arrived quickly and in perfect condition . my parents have already watched all the movies and loved them ! !
great movie ! i loved watching it twice .it 's a classic now and i would recommend it for your enjoyment . having all three is great as well . under rated movies .
it arrived on time and works well . i love shopping with amazon . things are always as they appear and the prices are always reasonable .
good movie ! good story ! would be better if it is in color ! can it be remade in color ? i 'll buy one if it is in color .
bought it for a friend at work . watched it to see if i wanted a copy too . not my kind of movie .
wanted to add these to my collection , and at this price , i could not afford not to ! very happy with this dvd set ! !
just watched the movie and it brought back memories when i first saw it many years ago . goldie hawn was great in this movie .
it 's an entertaining movie ! just when you think you 've got it figured out , you 'll be surprised in the change of events . worth the rent !
started out an intriguing mystery but became a kind of stock story . worth seeing but not memorable . good for kids .
good sound and picture get to see neil off stage as well good live versions of some classic hits as well as newer ones a+
i enjoy a good a movie that keeps you on your toes . this one does and you are surprised at the ending .
great movie , great picture great sound and a lot of extras on the blu ray ... . must have for your anime collection
it takes a little while to get into it especially with this first season but after 3 or 4 episodes , you should get hooked .
another one of the stories that i did not relate too ( for some reason ) but i am sure others will rate it much higher .
this is a fun story for kids and adults to watch over and over again . a well thought out story with a good point .
after seeing previews on tv , i thought this would be a good movie . not so , it was a long , drawn out and boring movie and i would not recommend it .
great movie for a good price . i was actually looking for both the new and old movies and amazon was where i found them .
the great writing and the chemistry of the cast make this great comedy entertainment for young and old .
for all of us gay guys that are more interested in love and caring than just sex . love is all you really need .
brings me back to my childhood with this series . i was n't able to watch much television , but when i was , this was one of my favorites !
this was a very original movie . it was fairly well written and acted . it was probably the best movie experience i have had in quite some time . it 's worth your while to watch
was an all right movie . the kids did n't like it as much as we were expecting . not as kid friendly .
it was a gift for someone else and they like it and it was at a great deal and price
absolutely dumb ! there was a storyline you couldnt follow and the gore was lame in the parts you thought were gon na be the best . good actors but a horrible movie ... .
this is a great sci fi movie . and its stunning on hd dvd . if you have an hd set , you need this movie .
great movie very funny see it a long time ago and just had to have it on dvd to own
i love all of these movies . they are all classics and this a very great value to get all four of them in one set . you ca n't go wrong !
my grandson is into sports . when he ca n't play them , he likes to watch them . this dvd fit the situation . it provides hours of entertainment .
this is one of the best sci fi films in the last twenty years . such good action , acting , hot ladies . etc . you get it . buy it .
after watching season 1 , i went on to purchase all the seasons on dvd . one of the best written shows i 've seen . i 'm now watching this for the 2nd times !
typical adam sandler production , good story happy ending . hey i liked it you decide for yourself ! great for the family .
it was a great production , the acting was fantastic . a war picture that was more about the characters and their mission then just blood and gore
we enjoy the heroes and there stories and collect many of them and enjoy watching them many times with friends
this movie is incredibly sad , yet you feel a sense of hope in the boy , oliver . the songs are catchy and the timing is perfect !
this is one off my favorite cartoons . i 'm so glad i found it . it is one of the cutest cartoon movie . kids of all ages will like this movie .
a very good story that explains wonder woman 's life . the rest of the story is a great action story with some great with reference to greek mythology .
this movie is just stupid , do n't waste your money on this ! poor gore and poor make up and stupid acting ! just glad i never bought it . not even worth renting !
my kids and myself absolutely loved it , it 's funny , it 's sweet and most of all it 's totally entertaining . one of those movies you can watch over and over and still love it
very surprising . loved the singing . bought the cd also and love it . the actors and actresses were excellent . what else can i say , it was definitely a blast from the past .
amazon is the only place i buy dvds and cds they always come in good condition and very low prices .
this is a very touching movie with superb acting . it goes straight to your heart . it is one of the most romantic movies that i have ever seen . i highly recommend it .
this is another one for our john wayne collection . not a big fan of this type of movie , but we did want it just to have it in the collection .
i did n't get to see all the waltons when i was growing up . since i am older i really appreciate this show and it brings back a lot of good memories of the way i grew up
this movie is one of my all time favorites . great story . wonderful special effects . truly a must have for any sci-fi movie fan . pure enjoyment .
i love sinatra and like him in his later movies . it 's nice to be able to see him get better with age .
rocky has got to be my favorite movie of all time . a true inspirational story and a very well written screen play by sylvester stallone . totally recommended .
my kids loved this movie they were owned vhs before and lost it . thank you and have a nice day !
when i first watched this movie it made me cry on some of the parts but a great family movie to watch with the whole family
needed the first season to finish the series this is a great series i am so glad it finally came out on dvd for us all to enjoy .
if you have n't seen these movies you missed some great movies , both of these movies are timeless classics for your collections !
ted was a great movie unrated of course truly not fit for kids but it was really crazy i liked it
this show was always one of my favorites . i will watch it many times . the actors always do a good job .
if you ca n't afford the full season on dvd get this one instead . it has some of the funniest episodes on one dvd .
we happened across this originally on youtube and my son loves it . it gets annoying when playing for too long , but my kids find it so funny ( 1 and 2 years ) .
i would personally rate it 3 , but my husband really liked it . he is like a modern day dirty harry , but in a tv series .
loved this non vulgar version of a classic western movie . happy and sad at the very same time . loved it .
if you do not have this in your library then i suggest you buy it for sure ! keeps you on the edge of your seat . very action packed . i give 5 star
one of the best historically accurate war films ever . great action scenes , great cinematography the acting is good , location great and well balanced movie .
this dvd of elvis is a must for elvis fans . very entertaining and funny with great music .
this movie and girl ca n't help it are the best cult films ever . just plain fun !
i ordered this complete series as a gift to my mom . she is a huge columbo fan and loved getting the complete series .
80 's movies are the bomb and these two do not disappoint at all . good combo movie pack . i hope they bring out more classic 80 's movies soon !
murdoch mystery has appealing characters , excellent writing and is a wonderful period mystery series . highest rating for a fun detective series .
love this movie . saw this as a kid and always wanted to own it . saw it , bought it , watched it , loved it still . thanks !
i love this movie . it is light and fun but still meaningful . goldie hawn is so funny in this . can keep re-watching .
it was a long silly movie . i can not understand how this movie could ever get 5 stars or any awards . it is absolutely a waste of money and time . the story
this is a great movie . it shows love compassion strength . and courage . i have told all my friends about this movie . thanks barbara
i enjoyed this one too . it is fun and clean ... typical of this decade . i find these movies refreshing since they focus more on the human aspect than a sexual one . nice .
have n't watched this yet because i got this dvd to add to my collection of tv shows that we watch .
the military is already training for this type of scenario . does n't surprise . i am surprised it has n't happened already . very well directed
thank you for putting this together , whoever you are . in my opinion , the first four seasons of happy days are the best , so on to # 4 !
good old fashioned scares . actors are great . the settings and the lighting helped keep me on the edge of my seat . really enjoyed .
this is a fun movie with fun acting and good actors . do n't take this too seriously and you will enjoy this movie .
great movie , kind of a chick flick with a great story line . and what makes it even better is that johnny depp is in it .
some movies are made for children ; this is one of them . it held the attention of my grandchildren and they loved it . that is all that matters . it was cute and funny .
sat down and watched it with my kids who are young teenagers . they loved it and they wanted watch again . great movie with good values in the end .
it 's a pretty decent movie . lots of action to keep you interested but it 's also very weird in the story and what 's going on
i had to get this dvd to add to my other shirley temple collection . watching her as a kid is one of my memorable memories .
love this program . it has action and some romance . very good and exciting , it is a must see show . love it !
it 's the only place i could find a blu-ray of & # 34 ; head & # 34 ; and am very satisfied with my decision / purchase .

i really love this movie . just a great , uplifting story and a feel good movie . a great soundtrack as well .
how can you not love the little mermaid ? this is a great price for a double pack and a good way to complete the little mermaid collection .
i like this one as much as the first , but i seem to watch this one more . the action , comedy , the supporting cast , everything made me like this . check it out .
the whole saw series is very good but the transition onto blu ray looks no different then it did on dvd
i loved the original story , i loved the movie as a kid , i still love it now as an adult , i have the whole collection now .
i liked this movie . i definately did n't see the story going in that direction so it definately helped it not to be so predictable .
my 3 1/2 year old granddaughter loves this and likes to watch it repeatedly . i love it because it is a lot of fun .
lots of action , which i love . and who does n't love & # 34 ; the rock & # 34 ; ? i would watch again . good story line .
we really enjoyed the movie . the color was good but the background music was too loud . the story line was very good .
great sandra bullock film to add to my sandra bullock library of her old and new films . nicole kidman is also great .
i bought this for my daughter because she wanted a work out video that had easy moves and good music ... she loves it ! ! !
a good plot to the movie . very believable flying action . the acting was good . always got to have a hot head in every movie . already suggested friends to watch it
... movies ever made . how anyone could rate this less than 5 stars is beyond me .
its timeless . its awesome . u cant beat blu ray . u need to buy it to believe how cool it sounds and looks ! !
though this movie had many well known movie stars , i did not find it interesting enough to even finish watching .
great acting , story line , another outside of the box approach to one of the greatest figures of all time ... son of god ?
i do n't know what more to say . i love criminal minds , it 's one of my faves . and this is definitely a good season , full of drama . you 'll love : ) .
this is a great movie . the story is original and the movie was very well done . i hope they continue this series the way this movie was done , a must see !
richard gere plays a different side then i am use to . you kind of hate him and love him in this movie .
entertaining for a moment , but cheap tricks and cameos are n't enough . i ca n't even remember the major plot points . i would pass on this in the future .
this is a well done mini series . the acting is superb and the story is rich . i found it to be funny .
the movie , at its core , is a good movie ; yet , i found it to be long and dragged out , at times . could have been better ...
i have always enjoyed disney movies - animated or not . this was well written and fun to watch , i would highly recommend .
i really enjoyed watching the series its so hard to find a good sci fi . would have enjoyed a fifth season
we love disney movies and toy story 1 & 2 are both awesome movies . this is a classic that will always be loved by children of all ages .
i loved the history in this movie . i found it very inspiring and think that all americans should listen to the message !
the first season of charles in charge is great , but it gets much better throughout season 2. i really hope universal releases season 2 soon .
this was one of my husbands fathers day gifts . need more steven seagal movies as he is so crazy about his movies .
story line could have been so much more . i found it hard to follow . i watched it a second time and caught some things , but there are still some things that i have not figured out .
i actually liked the original better - i did n't think the acting was as good as it could have been
plenty of it in all of them . cast and characters superb . i 'll never tire of watching them .
a visually stunning movie ! this movie is just beautiful to look at and sometimes i forget to follow the storyline . the story is classic and told well .
i was raised on westerns and this one does n't disappoint ! buy it , pop some popcorn and enjoy !
i find myself looking forward to watching each new episode . i like mystery type programs instead of reality drama shows . this one is a home run for me .
not my cup of tea but my wife can not get enough of this show . it is a laugh fest for those who like that kind of humor .
great movie . have loved this movie since it first came out in the theater . the special features on this dvd are also very fun to watch as well .
we purchased this shrek dvd to replace an old vhs copy . now we have the whole set on dvd - older kids still love it !
this is a great movie just started watching it and its awesome ... ! ! ! i cant wait to get home and watch the rest ... ! ! !
cameron diaz is always entertaining . she is very funny in this movie . it is a little raunchy at times . this is a fun movie to watch .
jason statham had hair ! ! ! it was nice to watch him in another part , then we are used to seeing him .
not a deep thought provoking film but a good watch nonetheless . the film moves along well and the action is believable .
buy this dvd ! ! ! one of the cutest movies out there for the whole family ... for big kids and the little ones ! adorable !
i love this movie , every chance i get i 'm watching this movie . this is the type of movie that never gets old . i laugh everytime i watch this movie .
i love love love this set ! i have it on vhs and now i have the set on dvd . thanks so much !
excellent movie . low budget but done very well . good visuals , plot and acting . i would recommend this as a must have for any scifi fan .
i only wish he had made more movies . he may not be the greatest actor , but still a good clean movie .
great deal ! i could n't pass this offer up , as it is rare to have this price on a disney blu ray .
since i have not received this dvd i can not really give an opinion , but am sure i will enjoy it when it gets here .
love this movie ! ! ! bought this after having numerous friends talking about it and i have loved every minute of it ! !
i really liked this series , even though i do n't really believe in revenge . it explores the good and bad about revenge , and is quite a sad show .
too too many people have tried making horror spoof movies , and this is the only one that did it well .
excellent movie if you enjoy action packed movies . all the guys in the movie played a perfect part for their role in the movie .
but i ca n't do any better . this is really a super performance .
this is a great and funny movie that all ages would enjoy . it will make you laugh and cry . i highly recommend it .
this is a nice set and will be a great addition to any american dad fan . there is nothing special about it or the packaging but you get the most important thing the episodes .
what a great sense of the 1950 's gone space age . the look and the characters are great . this is a fun film .
this movie is great , have always liked this show . love the songs and music as well as the comedy plus a love story . would recommend this movie to all who wants fun .
i have only used this once and did n't particularly like it . although , it did give me a fairly good workout . it is not my favorite dvd . but , would recommend it .
this is a great show and the fifth season was amazing . glad i own this .
i really liked this movie a lot . it has everything you want to watch in a movie . it is a great movie ! !
father ted is just fun . not unlike the three stooges no deep message here just a joy to watch . very funny stories .
how can you go wrong with a ( 3 ) movies with john wayne he is great . all 3 movies were great
i enjoyed this movie and thought all the actors did a great job . i may actually purchase this so i can enjoy it many more times .
no particular words can rate this hitchcock movie except that it 's a & # 34 ; wonderful classic & # 34 ; ! ! one of his best ! ! great buy .
the movie was very good , even if it was sad . the actors did a great job . most women would enjoy this movie .
this is probably the best mini doc ive ever seen of probably the three greatest musicians of our time ! highly reccomend if you 're a fan of one or all three .
a thin book , but worth the price . she is obviously a loving dog owner but also a good teacher . i understand what my dogs are telling me much better since reading her book .
the pirates of the caribbean series in general is one of the best set of movies out there for people who like action , romance , and witty humor . definitely watch this movie , and its sequels .
i never saw the movie . i thought i purchased a dvd and discovered too late that it was digital to be used on the computer only . we ca n't watch movies on our computer .
clean cut , entertaining movie , would recommend to anyone , especially if you grew up in a large family or wanted to know what it would be like to grow up in a large family
good way to relive your childhood and enjoy a good tv show were you know good and evil was so must buy
bought this movie because it was based on a true story and that can make a slow movie worth watching if you like that type movie .
at first i thought it was going to be lame and cheesy but it turned out way better then i expected ! ! ! !
my husband and i have always loved this movie and i am glad to have it in dvd ! the special effects are great !
it 's so funny and cute . kept the whole family entertained the entire film . we usually just rent movies but we actually bought this movie .
it was a really good show , and i recieved it fast it was packaged very well , a movie the whole family could watch
my daughter has been watching this movie since she was about 9 months old and at 2 years old this is still one of her top favorite movies . it was the first movie to make her laugh .
i thought this movie was decent overall . better than i expected . it kept me interested , what can i say .
search for this movie for sometime - hard to find a place that carries old movies - came on time .
this show is great and wonderful entertainment for the entire family . you do n't get many shows like this any more . if you do n't own it , what are you waiting for ?
bought for my daughter . watched it and was pleased . sometimes i have to watch a chick flick to get back to reality .
although this version has no big name stars , it was the version my daughter and rest of family would watch together each week on pbs . we enjoyed it as great family entertainment .
this movie is an old favorite and first introduced me as a child to morgan freeman . i cry every time i watch this movie .
a real waste of time ! you might like this if your jewish but then again you might be more offended too !
this is a great movie . thanks for getting this movie to me on time and in one piece . john wayne is one of my favorite actors .
late to the party on this series but now i am completely hooked . i think the next couple seasons will only get better .
very fun . lots of innovative twists with the different monsters . good message for parents and kids . i enjoyed it a lot more than i expected to .
love the movie ... love dennis quaid and julia roberts as well as robert duvall and the other actors . it is funny and entertaining and well worth watching .
love having this show on dvd because i can skip the segments about george 's parents . they are they only dull point in an otherwise amazing series .
i have never seen this show , so i was so glad to see the complete series on dvd . have n't watched yet , as i am watching something else .
state and main is a witty , intelligent , and funny movie . worth owning .
love this story and all the bugs . disney did great job on this one . perfect for young children . loved it
funny ... never thought about it ... bateman is only one letter away from batman ! one of the greatest psycho thrillers ever . if you have not seen this movie you are just wrong .
they do n't make movies like this anymore . chevy chase was king of comedy when this was made . i will buy more of his movies .
we watched this movie and it is something that all families should watch . i would recommend this to any one
pretty neat premise with lots of twists and turns . a bit predictable by today 's standards but still a great movie that stands the test of time .
i had a friend over and since she had not seen it , we watch together . it was delightful . very entertaining .
the product arrived in excellent conditions and in time . and the product itself is great .
great movie . if you have never seen this movie , it is a great kid movie . there is also a second one that is good too .
suppose it could be called chick flick with a difference ... but still well beloved and does n't disappoint - if i say that over and over it is because it is true and so seldom is !
pretty good subject but i honestly thought it 'd be a better movie . it 's an ordinary comedy while this subject could make a wonderfully amazing movie .
i received the movie quickly and i have enjoyed watching it with my son . i hope that they will make more . : )
got this as a gift for my grandson , have not watched it yet , so hoping the dvd is in good working condition , would recommend this site
goldie hawn and kurt russell are delightful together in this dvd that i have seen many times on video tape .
loved the first 2 movies , but the 3rd one was lame . otherwise , i would have given the set a 5 star rating .
what a wonderful combination . the movies are amazing ! i 'm so glad to have these movies in my collection ! thank you !
if you like linda blair you will try to get as many movies as you can with her in them . ca n't say it was great but is great for my collection .
love this movie very suspensful and awesome very well worth purchasing who highly recommend this to who anyone who loves suspensful movies
i 've only watched half of this at this point but it 's already got me hooked . i enjoy history anyway and this keeps your attention .
this was a xmas gift for my son , so i know he has enjoyed it , but i ca n't say i have watched it at all . but he wanted more info and movies on world wars .
meh . liked the other bourne movies much better . did i mention it seemed really long ? in short , not worth the time .
it 's one of those movies that i grew up watching . it 's not meant to be plausible , it 's not meant to make sense . it 's just meant to be fun .
i just like dr , who with tom baker the story is great , clean , and action . and the ladies that work with him are also great . for me he is the best doctor who
i purchased this for one of my sons for one of his christmas presents . he loves the spartacus series and i will purchase any further series for him .
it was very enjoyable movie . it was non stop action . it was an effective background for the lord of the rings trilogy .
enjoyed different episodes and were good family entertainment . had seen some before but good value for the price . whole family could watch .
it truly is a family movie and is one of my favorites . i do n't think this movie ever received the attention it should have . imagine star trek for real but , funny : - )
bringing up baby is fun . i saw this movie when i was a kid , then after i discovered it at amazon i new i had to buy it .
this dvd came promptly after ordering . it came as stated on the amazon website . i am very happy with my purchase , and i would recommend them to others .
you 've got to see this if you have n't already , and if you have , see it again ! it 's great ! ! loved it !
kept me guessing and was an interesting story . i thought it had a nice twist for the ending and was fun to watch .
different take on a famous historical figure but quite enjoyable nonetheless . especially good to watch in 3-d as the special effects really come to life in such mysterious ways . worth checking out .
i did n't particularly like this movie . it was dated , plot moved very slow and in fact my wife and i turned it off before the end because it was getting to be boring .
this was better than the last one . i 'm sure it will be popular . just not my favorite . a bit predictable .
the world has been saved . a great scary movie for everyone who is anyone . bravo .
came before it was promised it the shape it was promised and it 's just a great all around movie . l
what 's not to like , and blu-ray makes it even more wonderful . everything works to make this classic a wonderful view to keep .
denzel was great as always and i loved the fact that he owned up to being drunk and not putting it on his dead friend .
we watched this movie with my mom who had not seen the movie but had read the books over 30 years ago . she loved it and is looking forward to seeing other movies that she has not seen
i havent watched this movie yet but i have read the book and one of my friends said the movie went well with the book so i am sure i will love it
one of my most favorite movies that i re-watch all year . like the story , the characters , the setting , the family !
bruce willis makes the ultimate sacrifice to save the planet ... it moves me every time i watch it , just plain awesome !
this is the real aliens movie , not the knock off . great acting , award winning graphics and effects . highly recommend this movie .
i remember reading this when it came out in comic book form , the artwork and story are very true to the original .
i rented the hunger games first because i wanted to make sure i loved it as much as the books . when i ordered the 2 disc dvd , i was impressed with all the extra features !
received these dvd 's in a timely manner in good condition . these are great . tom selleck is the perfect actor for these .
awesome anime movie one of the best out there and awesome voice actors love it
this movie was not what i had expected however , it was a very heart felt movie . i do recommend everyone give this one a watch .
good action movie . i like anything with bruce willis and this was not a disappointment . if you like this kind of movie , this would appeal to you .
i just love the charlie chan movies i like the old black and white movies i think they are best they dont make movies like that any more .
there 's not much to say . great movie . i had it on vhs . i needed a clean version for my dvd collection . it a class of it 's own .
again , this is one of my husband 's favorite movies and he 's enjoying it a lot . thanks for a quality product .
i enjoyed this movie very much it was entertaining and kept my interest . i would like to have more movies as good as this available on amazon prime . i may even watch it again .
it is what it is , a kids movie . it is ok for kids up to 13 yrs old . do n't take teenagers . they are going to want to leave half an hour after starting .
this one was n't as good as i hoped it would be . the ending is n't what i wanted and i guess i hated to see it end a series of shows that i loved .
this is a fantastic movie . some historical mistakes like there was never a car chase , but that 's hollywood . ben is fantastic .
i bought this dvd collection mainly for scream of fear , but the other movies are solid , too . you just ca n't go wrong with some hammer horror !
this movie has lots of sex and twists to it . i liked it for the most part .
loved it . so excited to have this in my collection . ca n't wait for the rest of the episodes to come out .
thanks for the great dvd and the wonderful memories too ! now i can rewatch when i want ! ! ! thanks for the memories
another movie that the trailer was better than the movie . just a terrible movie to watch and sorry i did .
i 've loved this movie since the first time i saw it at the theater . now i can watch it as many times as my husband watches his favorite war movies .
i was disappointed with this movie . there was nothing special about the storyline that kept me on the edge of my seat .
as with all things i order on `` amazon.com '' , i received the dvds earlier than anticipated . i was very pleased . in fact , i just ordered more dvds from amazon.com yesterday .
i had seen this years ago when it first came out but i wanted to see again ... .it 's really good without being corny .
kind of a crazy movie , funny sad , weird at times but over all a good movie . you will enjoy it .
the movie was good but i did not care too much for this documentary . but for sure you should catch the movie .
i ca n't say much about the movie because i have never seen the movie . my daughter is the scary movie fan in the family and she says it was great .
this is a very entertaining movie . getting a chance to see a cg version of what ancient rome looked like is worth the purchase price alone .
i 've ordered every season and know it will probably come to an end soon . if you enjoy british police dramas , then this series is for you . it 's worth the $ .
i enjoyed this movie . it 's definetly best described as cute . i did not realize it was not actually in french though ! i would recommend it .
i loved the story - it was well done but the quality of this picture was a two star .
i much say , it 's an excellent movie . action packed as all of vin 's movies . the cast was excellent . it was so good , i watched it 3 times in 24 hours .
it 's a great restoration of the theatrical presentation . i 've only seen it on commercial tv previously and have seen parts of the movie that i 've never seen before
matthew mcconaughey is awesome in his role . he should have gotten an oscar for it . his partner in the movie was awesome as well .
i gave it 3 stars because it was n't as good as the first hunger games . now i know that a 3rd will be made and i hope it is better .
now this is what movie making is all about . two thumbs up all the way - five stars - a masterpiece .
the people were very good actors , interesting to watch , not boring and lots of twists and turns in this mystery . good quality dvd , played good .
we can not go to the movies , so we buy them . this was a great flick . it was great make believe .
the movie was very good and also the acting . it really lets you know what this family went through to find each other and is a true story . very sad but good ending .
i very much enjoyed this little film that i had never heard of before . only an hour & a half , well worth killing some time over .
this is one of the best romantic comedy film , i love all the main characters here , great story , great characters and great acting !
i grew up on johnny quest and the hardy boys . i love how this show takes it to both youth classics .
i chose 5 stars as it exceeded my expectations ! ! ! this series is very suspenseful . i 'd reccomend this set to anyone .
this is a good muppets movie and keeps the kids attention . this is one of their best i think and worth the money
this movie is really awesome . it is really funny and has plenty of action . the ending is unpredictable .
the dvds came ahead of time . work perfectly and i found the show to be enjoyable and entertaining . it 's just a shame there were so few episodes .
i gave this movie as a gift , person i gave it too enjoyed it thoroughly , i thought it was given too much hype
this movie was stupid and i might watch it again , but it will be a while and it will probably be by accident .
very good movie with lots of action and also a good story to go with it , enjoyed watching it over and over
the audio and video quality of this movie was extremely poor , not clear at all and lots of audio noise too
the regular dvd edition is better quality then the blu-ray . there are no special features . its also in french . not sure why this version sucks .
really enjoyed the movie , thought both leads were somewhat believable . if you like johnny cash then do not miss it .
i like these types of movies and enjoy it very much . price was right and quick shipping compared to some other online sites . the movie is a must see for those who enjoy the sci fi approach .
i thought the picture was clean and the sound great . it felt like you were in a movie theatre . i like the price of this blu ray
excellent story line and twists throughout that will keep you guessing until the very last frame . good drama , good action , and good suspense . what more could you ask for ?
just went ahead and bought it finally . a must have film for chick flick lovers . terrific cast and very well acted .
best investment i ever made ! if you are a west wing fan , pick up this collection . you will not be sorry !
this is one of the more enjoyable movies in my kids collection for us all to watch together . great movie for the whole family
this is the first of the twilight saga . it is a great movie ! i would for sure recommend it to anyone in the world ! !
loved the way he teaches and the information in this dvd . ca n't wait to get the rest of the passion talk series .
one of my husband 's favorite movies and my son watched it for the first time with us . love the movie . great quality and will definitely watch again i am sure .
well i knew that it was something like men in black but i can not say that i really enjoyed it .
i bought this series because i enjoyed watching it when it was first produced - the acting is excellant and the story is good - i do enjoy it !
my kids love this movie am not sure why its kind of creepy i think . my sister sad its scary but its not scary looking to me . any ways very pleased and great price !
our purchase and delivery of the product was a wonderful experience ! to top it of , the condition in which the product was sent was exceptional ! we are very satisfied on the overall .
this is awful . with sandler all talking in a weird voice , pretty awful . and the animation wasnt even that good .
i would recommend this to anyone who is wanting to keep the trash of today 's t.v . programs out of their children 's minds .
it 's hard to say what i think about this . it is really interesting . but overall only worth seeing once . at least that is how it is with me .
i really like this movie cause it is old and romantic . it is long and that is good and the actors are great .
this is one of my favorite movies of all time . if you have n't watched it ... you should !
the fact that it is based on a true story was remarkable ! had to listen closely at times as the accent got me sometimes - very good movie .
i think this should be the last in this series . the characters are getting tired and need to be put to rest and a new series started .
if you are a die hard phantom fan , you will enjoy this second film . it has a few twists and an interesting ending .
excellent movie . so nice to see no violence on this just plain fun film . all the actors are clean cut mostly and a joy to watch
this is a fantastic movie and is one of our favorites . i thought i had already replaced the vhs copy so when i realized i did n't i had to get it .
no other words necessary except that johnny depp is the coolest ( next to keith of course in the next movie ) ca n't wait for the sequel ! ! !
i had never seen this movie before so had no idea of what to expect . it was enjoyable yet sad at times . i am glad i picked the movie .
arrive on time and in perfect condition . it 's so nice to be able to watch a singer sing . love this dvd . thanks you !
excellent series ! the greatest series that has ever been on tv . this is series that i ca n't get enough of ! i would recommend this series to anyone who loves good tv shows !
excellent cast and character development ; good story . this was a fast moving plot with characters that immediately got your attention .
this movie was so lame i do n't know where to start . the only good thing is the story line had potential . it was just not put together very well .
great movie about the values of life - faith , honor , courage , and helping others achieve their dreams : ) . loved every minute of it !
highly recommend this movie . great acting and great story . plan on buying the book and the movie it is based on .
i enjoyed watching it . it was n't as intense as the first two but still good to watch .
a `` chic flick '' for certain but one any ( mature ) chic would enjoy . another oldie but goodie . cute plot and well acted .
finally this saga comes to blu-ray in the only edition that matters , extended . finally comes alive the way you wanted it to !
movie came early and played well , no problems at all , was a good movie to watch for some good entertainment
i had already seen the made for t.v . movie so i knew what to expect . i enjoyed the story and delivery of the product was wonderful . that is why i deal with amazon .
sorry but this was not my kind of movie.i only watched part of it and really could not get into it . the acting was not that good and to much nudity . i will not recommend this movie .
this is one of the all time great series from hbo ! ! and as good as the first season is , it only gets better and better ! ! ! ! nice play , amazon : )
fun , goofy , full of adventure , good actors , odd slap stick , never ending , slightly predictable . clean fun . kids will love it .
i love step brothers and watch when i need mindless laughing . will ferrell is hilarious in my opinion and this movie is no exception .
this movie had no purpose . i did not like it and hate that i spent the money to buy it . it was not what i expected . i was bored with it and never finished watching it .
this is a cute movie . my 3 kids love it as well as the other two movies . i recommend for your disney collection .
have n't watched the entire series yet but am finding this series simply wonderful .
i really ca n't say anything more about this movie other than what has already been said . just a freaking awesome movie !
we watch this because my husband want to and it was a good cowboy movie . it did have some moments in it that i would have not seen but over all it was a good movie .
first season is the best ... although you can get it in the colorized version , i prefer black and white . it 's classic and i enjoy watching it over and over !
i love this series ! so funny and entertaining . i ca n't wait for the rest of the seasons to come out on dvd .
i watched this show since it was first aired and it is such a great balance of drama and humor and a great story line .
this is a good movie , especially if you like the music of glenn miller . it 's a bit slow but overall good .
i am rating this movie low both on the quality of the image and the film content itself . a bad movie with bad image quality . avoid at all cost .
this dvd was purchased as a christmas gift . my husband really enjoys this movie . the dvd had good quality sound and picture .
great movie for kids . hope they keep making more . the grandsons loved it . made a great gift . did n't worry about them watching it .
i love watching good hero movies and when i saw this in the theatre , i had to add it to my dvd collection .
this show is a classic . it is great and well worth the money when you find it on sale , which is often . the dvd came in one piece and brought back memories !
i very much enjoyed the movie , it was funny and delightful to watch . i 've seen some of the previews of the title and could hardly wait to get it .
this maybe old tv show but was still as interesting as it was years ago liked seeing the old faces again the new movie made us want to go back and get the old tv series to watch
had the vhs but wanted the dvd this worked perfectly and is exactly what i needed to update my collection .
my kids enjoyed this series so much better than the new stuff so i decided to order all the seasons .
had n't really heard much about this before i got it but got it based on reviews . the kids loved it and the story was good and safe for the young ones . overall , very good movie
i watched with my wife and daughter , they were on edge most of the movie . i liked all the action . not a bad rendition of a zombie movie .
great set of movies at a great price . got this blu-ray set when it was on special . ca n't beat it .
this was a huge series when i was in high school , everyone i knew , even teachers talked about it the next day .
well , what to say , most of these `` types '' of movies just suck , but this one was good . watch it , good funny movie
my kids love it but i 'm a little tired of it . but they like the songs and they like the story .
i bought it because i was searching for some movies to watch , and it was cheap so i guess you get what you pay for . it was not bad just somewhat cheesy sometimes .
was a very good movie but not what i expected however i would recommended it since it was very good watching .
the one that started it all . ordered this for my dad as well . i like this one the best out of all the movies .
these two movies are both very good choice 's for viewing on a family movie night . adults and children will enjoy them
only down side was it did not last long enough . it was just a mini series of a few shows
another amazon deal of the day with a great show like this how could i pass it up ... .
i loved this so much i ordered the 2 disc version . i love the music and the voices . and i would have chosen the phantom .
very fine copy of an all time classic . the lead actors are stunning and the writing is outstanding .
love this movie , great adaptation of the serial novel by stephen king . when i first saw this movie i could n't believe stephen king wrote the novel this was based on .
we bought this after renting , then buying super 8 on dvd , which got scratched because it was n't put back in the case . then we got a bluray player and decided this was a must buy !
i loved this film . it was incredibly funny , sweet and just well done all the way around . it had good writing , acting and directing . i laughed my butt off all the way through .
my 3 year old watches this over and over . this is one of her favorite movies and has a good plot . she is learning and having fun at the same time .
this is a classic redford movie . we watch this every christmas season and on blue ray the scenery is even more gorgeous .
this anime i can say met all expectations . it was just like how i remembered and i can recomend it to anime fans . in fact a friend also said it was good .
i really love this movie . i have watched this show for more than 10 times . fast pace and great effects . for me , it is a must have dvd .
always loved this film and now so do both of my daughters . a fun film with lots to think about .
this movie was n't as good as we thought it would be . i really would n't recomend it .
the original is hard to beat but they changed it up a little and did a pretty good job with the story .
most movies do not often beat the first or continue to get better . i was really happy with this movie . surprisingly moving and entertaining .
fans of the show are just fans of the show . i 'm a fan of the show ... one of the best and funniest tv shows ever ! !
the picture on the cover of this dvd gave us the impression that the quality would be better than it turned out to be . this was extremely disappointing !
excellent movie . the dvd is remastered and looks great from the old vhs version . a must have for lucille ball fans .
my mom loves this movie , so i thought i surprise her with an early christmas present . she was very happy to see it again .
this was a fantastic movie . i really enjoyed the special affects . ill be watching this one again for sure . .
it 's one and still one of his best films - not for kids but a great film and will always watch it every so often
have been collecting them for a while . would get more if i had the money . retired now and now working .
cute and funny and the ending was not what i expected . wo n't give it up so you have to see it for yourself .
i love this movie as a child and wanted to share with another child ! sharing is a good thing to teach children .
i love this movie . it is a tradition at our house to watch this at christmas . i highly recommend this movie .
barbra streisand 's best work is in this movie ! too much fun and watchable more then once .
how can anyone resist jane austen ? this is a very good adaption of jane austen 's & # 34 ; pride and prejudice & # 34 ; . i enjoyed it very much .
low budget , but pretty entertaining . lots of funny lines and other entertaining things . the acting is not as bad as many reviewers say . i have seen lots worse .
this is a great tv show even though some of the characters are off the wall . it still holds your interest .
this movie is fantastic ! ! ! ! it is an adventure classic . we all know the ending , but it is an all time favorite ! !
a classic performance by a great canadian and who is just amazing , can listen to leonard all day . awsome cd
this is a visually beautiful picture , it is well acted and i think the actors match the characters , not very deep , just an enjoyable evening .
i have loved this film since i was a child watching these war time movies . i was very happy to be able to buy once for my own collection of classic films .
five star movie . great acting , spectacular scenery , good character development , and much historical information about ww ! ! . wish i had know it was based on a true story before i actually watched it .
i enjoyed the movie very much . it was not only about fast and furious driving but a good story line . the characters were very good . i loved it .
the story was changed slightly , probably to make it more politically correct . the acting was no where as good as the old version . the songs were not very good.i was bored .
i used to have this move on vhs and i really loved it . tom hanks and meg ryan are great in this romantic movie .
good picture quality and a pleasure to watch - i am glad i bought this title as it is fun and makes me feel happy .
was a funny and overall great movie . my 2 year old grandson sat and did n't move threw the whole movie .
i enjoy watching all of their movies . i am watching house party as i type this and that is a classic movie as well .
you must watch it to believe it ! ! ! it can not and will not disappoint you . you will not not regret purchasing this ! !
loved this animation ... great message ... gave as christmas gift ... good for young and old alike ... can watch this over and over again .
it 's just a dvd set of my favorite era of wrestling . its the greatest matches ever . we watch it non stop
love one tree hill . my girls are really getting into it and loving it also , really enjoying it . thank you .
awesome - action packed and complex storyline as we are getting with the new bond movies . watched it with my 11 and 13 yr old boys - we loved it .
this movie did the tv series no justice at all . i never watched the tv show , but i heard it was pretty good -- this was terrible .
alex cross is a change for tyler perry . however , it is worth watching . i found it to be different , but entertaining .
great fun ! . if you like british shows and specially dr. who . its the bomb ! i hope they come back . enjoy !
i never saw it coming , great thriller without all the gore that other scary movies have . it had suspense , intrigue , with a twist . i would definitely recommend it .
i so enjoy watching downton abbey each sunday night . it will again be a long wait for season 4 to begin .
i love this movie and if you are a barbra streisand fan it is worth buying ... it is a movie i enjoy watching over and over again .
i watched this again here recently after seeing it several years ago . great actors and a great plot . will probably watch it again in a couple of more years .
this movie is okay , but i would not really recomend it for young children . there are a few messages that young children might not understand .
it was nice to get one more chance to see the gang . happy endings all the way around . perhaps not quite as magical as the original series , but still very enjoyable .
how wonderful to watch something clean and fun . i found myself smiling after every episode .
this was a gift for my son . i think he 's watched the whole series through about four times and will watch it again .
great movie with great actors and an exciting plot . it is not to be missed and you wo n't be disappointed .
absolutely heart warming , entertainment . no violence , cursing , sex , just wholesome entertainment with excellent acting . everyone below the age of 40 should be required to watch it !
i really liked this movie - if you are looking for suspense and a good story try this movies ! i was pleased with my purchase !
this is a very good mini series . if you like science fiction and an all around great story with very good acting . watch this ! ! ! !
this was a sit up and take notice kind of story and kept me on the edge of my seat throughout much of the picture . very good suspense .
there , s plenty of action in this film . victor mature played a good part in helping the soldiers bring peace with the indians .
as with all the previous series , series 5 continues the tradition of smart , witty , and very human comedy . where is series 6 ? ? ?
if you like sherlock holmes this is a good place to start a collection and a really good movie to watch
this one & # 34 ; grew & # 34 ; on me . some words hard to understand but will probably enjoy watching again .
this is one of the funniest sitcoms around . definitely worth watching . jason bateman is great , as are the other actors .
there is no information as to whether this blu-ray is the theatrical cut , or the far superior director 's cut . if it is not the dc , i will not be purchasing this .
love the movie when i was a kid , brings back times when i was young . great movie and would highly recommend if you grew up in the 60 's .
it great price for clint eastwood movies if you like boxing or space movies . my husband enjoy all the movies in this set
this is the second part . it was very violent and bloody . it was an interesting look at the development of this criminal and how he got to his end . subtitled and definitely not for children .
this was purchased as a gift for my daughter . she will be happy to have this in her personal library .
we had it on tape and then our vcr went bad on the tv . so when i found it on amazon . i had to get it . we watched it on christmas day . it was great
film is really outdated but i was interested in how rating system came all about
this is a movie for my mother she really likes funny make you feel good movies this is a very good movie to see and enjoy with anyone
fun and a decent action film , but a bit too predictable if you are looking for suspense .
this , in my opinion is one of the best films ever made . scary as hell , beautiful to look at , great acting all around . just watch it you have n't yet .
this is one to watch over and over again and can enjoy with your family . you will be captivated by this and anyone watching this with you will be captivated as well . i highly recommend this .
nothing good on tv , i go to amazon and watch instant videos & i like the older shows like cheers !
although the story line is a bit different that the book i did enjoy the movie . i would watch it again .
he 's a kid who has everything , so it is difficult to tell when something is exceptional ; however , he did view these and seemed to enjoy them .
it 's not my favorite movie , but it was pretty good , and even a little funny .
it 's an ok movie . not in the class of the first expendables . heroes coming out of nowhere to save the day . ok
received dvd on time and in good shape . this is one of my favorite tv shows .
some ! great price ! arrived on time ! perfect condition ! and it 's an awesome family movie to watch during halloween or whenever ! i would recommend the movie , item and seller . two thumbs up .
a fabulous movie that was perfectly cast , acted , and directed . i read the book and saw the movie twice . i recommended it to everyone i knew . the perfect movie for dialogue lovers .
it is such a classic movie . if you love the old horror movies you definitely should add this to your collection . my granddaughter loved it at 7 yrs old .
this is a classic that the whole family can watch and enjoy i could watch this one over and over
this was a gift for my daughter and she was very happy with it . we will recommend it to others who like this type of animation .
great ! we all love raymond . we like the commentaries of the writer 's too . that really adds to the enjoyment of the episodes .
alot better then the first movie , as long as you remember that this is a comic book version so it should not be realistic but just intertaining . alot of action .
i 'm not much for tv programs but i loved the movie . the story lines were good and i just loved everything about it . special effects were wonderful
i love it and i enjoy it very much , this product have very good quality and i will recommend to all my friends , thank you
great show wish he never went nuts . . . . . . . . . . . . ..
got it for father 's day present for my husband . he loves it . watches it all the time .
i 've enjoyed this movie since it was first released in theaters . it 's so much fun - the characters , the situations , even the end credits are funny .
i can watch this with my boys and even get lost in the story at times . ca n't wait for season 4
disney has done it again . this will be a classic . everyone loved watching it , from young to old . love the theme and songs !
i remember watching this as a child . i enjoyed it just as much as an adult . something about doris day that is timeless .
finally a date movie that i was n't rolling my eyes the whole way through ! i loved it ! the ending was perfect . i do n't understand why it got such bad reviews ... .
a good film in the buddies series for all ages . they are given super powers and help out the true owner of the rings .
we really enjoy this series . the cast is excellent and the stories are entertaining . i recommend this very fine tv show .
pretty decent and entertaining movie , not of the kind you 'll never forget , but a sweet story with some humor , nice .
i like it , but i wish it was digital , i would probably use it more . i was amazed at how good i felt afterwards .
my husband and i love the british comedies . this is his favorite . i think we have every one that has come out so far . excellent seller to work with .
movie received and was in very good condition , bought the movie for my grandson but enjoyed watching it with him !
i 've loved this movie since i first saw it in the theater . what a great suspenseful movie . clint is the best !
this movie was a bit different . not really a feel good but was n't bad . liked david hugh jones . the movies was a bit slow as well .
any real fan will love this season . the price is not that bad either ...
the acting awesome , the premise of this film is very innovative . scary but one day that may be the world we are all living in .
what can you say about this movie that has n't already been said . it is 50 years old but just as good now as then .
any texas fan must have this for all the extras on this version of the classic film and uncut finally
loved this movie and the actors were great . storyline was amazing and i loved the ending . thanks for making this .
i watched series 1 thru 4 and just had to have series 5 and now ca n't wait for series 6 ... .
not one that i would care to watch again but do not feel my time was wasted for watching it once .
interesting and some education . not a family movie . it 's more for couples that been married for a while . some interesting and funny things that come up .
good movie , well cast and you cared about the characters . however the ending was predictable ... maybe just because i would have liked a happy ending .
i 'm glad i bought this one because it is fantastic . i thought it would be some & # 34 ; b & # 34 ; thing , but it was absolutely great . must see !
this is the best one yet out of all them if you are a fan you will love this move
plot not well developed . did not leave me riveted to the screen . the dialog could have been better . some character could have been better developed .
after watching these films you have to wonder why eastwood would attempt comedy . but the movies are great ; well made and engrossing . but this is n't the collection to watch back to back .
this is a must have for any adventure time fan . though a few of the dvd 's have some repeat content . it 's still worth owning them all .
this is a great movie and my girlfriend had never seen it . read the description and if you think the story is even slightly interesting give it a shot . you will enjoy it .
i love this , i watch this with my children and they loved it to . i grew up watching this and it still holds it 's own .
it was good to see arnold back again . he is not as buff as he used to be , but he does still have that screen presence .
happy to have found these for our grandson to watch . his father enjoyed them every saturday growing up now his son can enjoy them too .
sean penn is so good in this movie . it is a really good movie and it is true ,
i really liked this movie ! it brought back a lot of memories of the way it is way down south . great action , just everything ! i loved it !

this is truly a movie gem - if you have n't seen this move - it is a must see . every couple of years pull it out and re-watch - it holds up to the test of time .
i received the movie die hard 2 within a week in great condition . i 'm very pleased with the movie and the service .
great story . truly a lost artist . another good example of remaining true to yourself . nice story that is uplifting . well worth owning or renting .
really good movie -- the opening scene , was a classic ... .. the new version of this movie will be just as awesome
extremely funny . have been in some of the situations that this dvd portrays . most of the parents with children will enjoy . recommend for friends with grown children .
this dvd is very good and educational in a christian view . i am glad i purchased it so my niece has good cartoon to watch when she comes to visit me .
impossible years is a good old movie from the sixties . it 's dated and the dialogue is fairly contrived , but it has some pretty relative humor on the never ending battle with teenagers !
watched it upon receiving it and not too excited about watching it again . probably should give it another try . not bad , just nothing special .
we have enjoyed watching this series and look forward to the last season which we have already received and will start watching soon . anyone who enjoys action and drama will completely enjoy this series
i had no clue about the back story for this movie , not a boxing fan at all , but really enjoyed the movie . great acting . christian bale is superb !
slap stick british humor . so silly it is funny . if you enjoy this type of humor this is the movie for you .

this movie is now one of our family favorites ! very fun and engaging . every family with little ones needs this title on their shelf !
this film is entertaining but does not live up to the first one , which is rather a pity .

of all the comic book movies that have released recently thor is the best . the special effects are absolutely amazing and the story line solid . you should see this one . i highly recommend it .
i love matthew mcconaughey , but in this movie he was scary creepy good . it has a twist worth waiting for . i recommend this movie to any suspense lovers with a strong stomach .
what can i say ? ? it 's jeff dunham and gang and it is a lot of fun . definitely something you want to watch over and over again !
i thought this was a great all around dvd concert . excellent music and picture . if you like these guys you cant go wrong with this dvd .
did n't think it was going to be that good actually watched it a 2nd time i enjoyed it so much would recommend to anyone who likes music and laughs .
i liked this one , it would be good for those with little kids . or those who are kids at heart . i will watch it again i 'm sure . & # 60 ; 3
this was a good movie . it did drag at some spots and could of been a little more interesting . but overall ok .
could have been alot more action scenes but overall it had a great plot and how it all tied in the characters .
my new favorite show . each show has a plot and builds off the previous episode , although if you miss one you can pick up pretty quick .
it 's a wonderful dvd . i loved her show and never missed an episode . it was nice to watch some good clean humor .
great movie - funnier and more story than the first . a must see for christmas time . you will enjoy it ! !
this film was the usual plot , usual characters , usual setting . blah blah blah . if you seen one ; you 've seen them all .
i love sci-fi movies but only those with a convincing story and plot . although the plot is simple , still holds a few surprises . it is a bit slow at the beginning but still very enjoyable
i already own this movie on dvd but my best friend never got around to buying it so i got him the blu-ray version and he loves it !
this movie will make you laugh . it is a great family movie . it will put you in the mood for christmas
bought this for my grandkids to watch . they enjoyed it as much as i did as a younger person . i would recommend this to anyone .

replacing old vhs tapes with dvds . i do n't know how many times i have seen this movie , but it has been plenty so had to get this one for when i need a laugh .
this show keeps me laughing for hours on end . i wish there were more episodes because i always watch a ton in one sitting .
i was really interested in this movie . but , the singing just did in for me . i could n't even watch 20 minutes of it .
perfect mix of satire , silly humor , and great music . i never get tired of watching this .
i like colin farrell movies and i think he did another great job making this movie exciting and on the edge of your seat .
just loved the people and story line very sad when it came to an end got very involved with them .
we are very pleased with this purchase . we purchased this as a gift for a family member who loves this movie .
star trek is back with new faces but the same characters . the visuals are wonderful and the storyline is entertaining .
i enjoyed watching sometimes just to see who is going to cry the most . it was good enough to keep me watching through the whole season .
i sat thru the first hour of this dvd , man was it boring . i would n't spend money on this piece of crap .

i love all the marvel videos . i had this before but someone borrowed it and never returned it so i had to get it again . great movie
sleeper film . lots of talent , both musical and acting . the plot seems a little silly , if you read it - much less so when you see it .
patrick swayze can do more than just dance . this is one of those pleasant surprises that you will enjoy . this a tale that will inspire and entertain at the same time .
captivating story set in an interesting time period . definitely a drama that is worth the watch . good acting and excellent scenery .
my son is a fan of the show , so i purchased it for him for his birthday , and he loved it . so i recommend it .
this was a very nice package and was a great bargain . it is like a return to the time and the series and something to keep and share with family and friends . thank you .

this was a cute and fun movie when it came out and it still is . a great movie to watch with the kids or simply enjoy rewatching for the adults .
as long as you do n't take it too seriously - it is a comic book - good fun , good cgi - worth the watch
i feel the movie was well done , it could have been longer . what i saw of it i really enjoyed .

ca n't get enough of iron man . robert downey jr. continues to make the series believable because he is one of the best .
the only thing wrong with this series is that there are not more episodes . i truly enjoyed all of the episodes .

any movie with al pacino is sure to be a winner . i 've always liked this one because it showed his future genius .

i thought that this was a great movie . so sad though . i hope you enjoy the movie like i did
very good actors/actresses playing the different roles close to the book and tyler perry very good choice ! thank you for an enjoyable movie .

it was funny but i would not buy it for anyone else . delivery was great and it was on time
these movies are a lot of fun . getting them as a set for such a good price is a great find .
not quite as good as lord of the rings , but a wonderful movie . ca n't wait for number 2 to come out
i had my first date with my future wife at this movie . it was simply a great movie and i decided to get a copy of the blu ray version as soon as i saw it .

anything with celtic in the title is worth buying . i also collect celtic woman dvd 's and cd 's to listen to on the road
i love this trilogy all 3 movies are really great and like they say they are more than meets the eye . if you love transformers i highly reccomend this trilogy .
one of the great 50s science fiction movies with very good actors . beware the & # 34 ; id & # 34 ; . it scared me the first time i saw it with my dad .
i grew up on the rocky movies and i love them to this day . i now have all six rocky movies that came out and they will be one of the all time greats .
i bought this as a movie our whole family could watch . my kids really did not like it . i love robin williams and the movie is ok but i would not buy it again .
great uplifting story , stellar cast . just good all the way around for cast . presentation , and the message to & # 34 ; carry on & # 34 ; .
this is one of my classic movies i love it we watch it ever year ca n't say enough about it love it
a lot of twists and turns on this movie . angelina jolie and antonio banderas are amazing actors when they work together ! definitely not kid friendly but a nice treat of a romance for adults : )
thought i would be able to be entertained by this film with the right amount of substance abuse , however i was left with only a few cheap laughs .
always interesting . like the stories . like the characters . nice to watch them again . fun to watch and remember from childhood .
the idea sounded like a good one for a story , but the movie just was n't as good as i thought it would be . i would n't bother watching it again .
here is a part of history that should be in everyone 's dvd library ! step back into time , and see how the civil war in america was fought ! i love this dvd and highly recommend it .

like the other series , they are all great . i would recommend it to all of you if you are interested in this family series when they were younger .
so the first animated resident evil movie was good , this was not quite there , but thoroughly enjoyable . i recommend this to any other resident evil fans !
what more can you say ... saw it on sale and added to collection - got there in time for the weekend .
this is a great anime ! i definitely recommend it to friends and anyone that enjoys a good laugh and stories about friendship .
story line is awesome , the movie is well produced . the acting is n't `` a list '' but is much improved over the previous movies . great family movie ( more appropriate for older children ) .
the movie was good with a surprise ending but was slow in the middle of the movie .
terrific performance can not wait for the bates a hotel 2 come out . very interesting . highly reccommend so good and entertaining .
season 2 continues a very good show . the characters continue to be developed and the storylines are interesting . looking forward to season 3 .
this movie hit on alot of life 's lessons and it is a good one to watch over and over . it is a good family movie and should be owned .
a nice alternative to the classic . can be used to get the point across but it is different that the bible in some points
i love this movie . it was purchased for my grand daughters and they loved it . good to have . teaches a lesson .
it was a little different than the first edition but still enjoyable . the story line was continued and am looking forward to the third .
i ca n't watch it i do n't have a vhs so i ca n't watch it so it does me no good .
this was delivered as promised and replaced quickly when the first one arrived damaged . replacement arrived quickly . i would do business with them again .
this is a look into a different kind of lifestyle and how two people are meant to be together . the other side of this is that these two guys are brothers and that 's just weird .
one of mark wahlberg 's and the rock 's better movies . the story line was excellent , ( based on a true story ) , and all of the other character 's were well played .
it would have been a good movie if it was free on prime but not worth paying for . kevin hart is funny though
love selleck , and this was not a disappointment . did n't know it was out , even though it 's one of his older ones . am glad to have it .
just plain weird . i can not say much else except a very strange premise . the description i guess doesnt want to give away the movie .
saw this movie on tv and liked it better then the other harry potter movies and i and to have it and to me it 's worth buying .
i loved everything about this movie . it has a good message and the story line is a winner . you wo n't be disapointed if you buy this dvd . a decent film for the entire family .
this is a warning , do not watch this if you do n't like to cry . i promise you will definately cry ! ! !
well i must say it was a pleasure and definitely an eye opener . great cast . story line was adequate . should be a keeper .
this is a christmas gift , but i enjoyed the one i saw . as long as this is new , it 's what he wanted .
i enjoy watching every episode with anticipation . i have not been disappointed in any of the episodes . the cast is fabulous !
tried to find this movie in the store and they never even heard of it . one of my favorites as a teenager . it was like brand new . thank you .
if you loved the first sherlock holmes then you 'll love this one as much . good acting and excellent production . even had some funny scenes too .
this movie brought back memories from when i was a child . i loved this movie . had to get for my collection
this is supposed to be a movie . it tells a story however there is no plot and not very funny . got through twenty minutes and had to turn it off cause it was so boring .
it is a strange , dark movie . if you are in to that sort of thing , then this may be a good movie for you .
this is my all time favorite comedian and this is by far the best movie ever . this movie will have you laughing from beginning to the end . i love jerry lewis .
i have all the columbo dvd sets and find this one to be the best of the best . i highly recommend it for any fan of columbo .
great movie that everyone that likes action and drama should watch , without fail . i was not disappointed in one bit !
this is a excellent dance movie to watch , the whole family enjoyed it and the kids watch watch it over and over because they like dancing to it .
disney really knows what they are doing - putting together great family entertainment ! the cinematic appeal is always wonderful and the story lines are great ! kids of all ages from 1 to 100 will love this one !
loved the whole series . it 's rare that sequels are any good , but 3 sequels , i say they were all awesome .
very entertaining enjoyable film . the whole family watched . this was a heart warming story with lots of humorous scenes . the film was very well done . i definitely would recommend .
i liked the fact it was based on a true story . very poignant and thought provoking . makes you realize what is important in life .

i have been a fan since i saw season 5 on cable . i am excited to find out how they got to there .
i have always liked johnny cash but never realized how good an actor he could be . he was outstanding in this movie .
a wonderful version of g & s 's pirates . beautifully performed by all , but kevin kline is really dynamic as the pirate king .
one of my favorite seasons from this awesome show . there is always something funny and new in each season and show . too bad they stopped making it .
the facts of life the first and second season is a great show for every teenage girl and everyone who just wants a good laugh .
this is an awesome movie this movie is so cool . the effects and the acting are great . this movie rules .
i love this movie and it looks even better on blu-ray , the special features are great . its soo cheap i think everyone should buy this for themselves or as a gift .
great movie , arrived quickly and was just as described by seller , very pleased with purchase . watching the third one tonight , spiderman week in my house , : ) .
a thoroughly enjoyable mystery series ! my family enjoyed and we are sorry there were only three seasons ! i recommend you start from beginning .
it 's still good , but not like the original movie rose red ... but it gives you an insight of the first movie ...
i 'm a big fan of lost and i watched every episode when it aired live throughout its 6 seasons . i do think that the 1st and 2nd seasons were the very best .
love this movie . soooo scary . this is an excellent addition to the scary movies that we watch in october for halloween . this original is much better than the remake . get this one ! ! !
a cool plot that has some very exciting moments and some neat tricks . all of the actors are great and work well together .
what could be better than this ? great stars and i love the story . i have watched this movie at least 10 times in the past 20 years .
bought this to complete my grand daughters collection she loves harry potter and this was purchased to complete her collection
we truely love this show and this man as an actor ! the show is great , has action , humor and james garner makes it great to watch !

i really liked the movie . it was extreme to watch & i 'm glad that i found this moive when i did .
love this movie . both of these guys are hilarious . it was not only funny but full of action as well .
all music seemed clear and complete , and some songs that stick with you long after you 've listened .
i have watched it twice now and even knowing the ending i liked it because i see a lot of the old actors you do not see any more .
the best movie ever . the whole family really enjoys this movie . download download this movie . i recommend this to anyone
our original dvd was damaged and we ordered this to replace it . jones and smith hit it out of the park . we must have watched this movie ten times over the years .
i like his job , he is very a wild guy with an innocent spirit that make this movie very funny .
not quite believable , i realize it 's just a movie but was depressing none the less . i guess it was okay .
my cousin got this for my grandparents and i was watching it and it 's sooooo funny ! it 's one of the best english comedies i can think of . get it !
i 've been waiting for this movie to come out on dvd . it finally arrived . this is the last great hollywood musical with class and charm . i have to have it in my dvd collection !
i thought this movie was going to so-so but it was so lovely and sweet . the whole family enjoyed it .
i like everything about this series -- the characters , the crimes they solve , and the portrayal of modern england . i recommend this crime series .
i saw this on cable but had to own this dvd . this item shipped real quick and we were hysterical all night . will do business again
this show is well written , with excellent characters and the plots are always pretty good . this is my new favorite show .
i am very happy with this selection of poirot dvd 's i try and buy one a month so i can end up with the entire collection .
so much action and mystery my heart kept watching and watching til the very end i could not put it down til it was completed ... . excellent movie
i got this for my husband who is a history buff . he loved it . he gave us all a history lesson while we watch it .
after watching the movie on tv , i knew i needed it for my collection . it was shipped quickly and i got it for a great price .
i purchased this for my daughter in law for christmas . it is one of her favorite movies and reminds her of home .
seems like another issue of men in black with another cast , not exactly my type of movie though it passed an hour or two
i first saw this on tv and wanted to watch the original . it was still funny to watch and even more so seeing the original .
i was really looking forward to seeing this and came away very happy as to story and overall effects to this movie . bring on the third movie !
this movie is kind of like mary poppins . i really enjoyed it . i will watch it over and over and over .
when the movie started , i did n't know what to expect , but his movie was pleasantly surprising . enjoyable . good acting and casting .
what is there to say except this series is one of the best every made for families to watch . it is full of fun and good values .
i thought this would be like any other alien vs human fight for the world , in which it is basically but the way the story line plays out keeps me entertained . nicely done .
i bought this movie because i thought i already had a copy but could n't find it . it is a very good film .
actually , this one was for me . it was recommended to me by my daughter . i did n't think i would , but i liked it . it was cute ! !
i love the simpsons 2nd season ! this season is the season that turned tv around .
this was a pathetic excuse to make a western cartoon ! ! ? ? ? the story line was completely unbelievable . oh well , you win some and you lose some .
good acting that could not overcome a very average predictable script . this is an adequate filler on a bad tv night . otherwise , i would pass .
love the action and chuck norris . i 'd really miss his walker texas ranger , but i have them all on dvd
love elmo and i love the dancing segment in particular . my grandaughter has been watching this alot since long before she was two and loving it . we always watch together
i think this is a true story , if not , then it 's very plausible ! replacing my vhs with a dvd for my collection .
i had seen this movie before but forgot the story . richard gere makes a good bad guy . not the best spy thriller ever made , but it has some exciting twists and turns .
this movie will stay in my collection for years ! ! what a great old horror flick ! !
everyone loves this film , it is hilarious and well written and just fun . even kids love it , safe for all ages .
i only bought this to complete my avengers movie collection . its fine if you like the hulk , but overall , meh .
very pleased with the overall service . the package came in wonderful condition and on time right before christmas as promised . very satisfied .
this set was a bit long in getting to me but i was very pleased with it and used it as a gift !
good story line , this was a great follow up on the hunger games . woody was great as always . jennifer lawrence was great
i actually bought this for my son . but i loved the series when it was on tv and plan on watching again .
i received this movie a few days ago , and my grandaughter loves it . well worth the price ! i would recommend this movie for children , especially on having kids over on a saturday or sleep over .
classic disney masterpiece , great blu-ray digital transfer , fun extras . i was thrilled to see this movie as a kid , and it only seems to get better with age .
it 's so hard to believe that it 's funny . i do n't think it was meant to be serious . what a spoof !
love the actors , loved the story line . definitely a chick flick but a guy could possibly enjoy it too . i would watch it again .
i bought this for my sons birthday and he has watched it over and over . he loves it . it has all his favorite songs on it .
my title say it all ! you 'll roll on the floor every time you watch ! if you 're in or on your way to college , this movie is a must have ( along with animal house )
my husband loves these movies . the only one we do n't have is the very last one . well have to look for that one .
denzel washington is always good . he 's such a great actor and good human being . it was a gift for my husband and he thoroughly enjoyed it .
i liked the movie , but it was a little scary that this could possibly happen . the characters in the movie were excellent
have loved this movie since the first time i saw it many years ago . it is so wonderful to now have it in my collection !
so glad i was able to buy it and so quickly . this is a classic for anyone that has n't seen it . acting , music all awesome . steve martin steals the show .
what more can i say this is an absolute classic and i am glad to finally have this on blu-ray
i chose this rating because i love this show . so it was great that i could get them on here
part three was the only real disappointment in the series ; not a terrible film just did n't meet the standards of the first two .
i think this is one of tom hanks best , he never loses character ; even as an adult . this move had added things that were cut from the theater version ; which makes it much better .
just when you think there can be no more story , it twists and turns again . this series is even more intense then the first three .
we had purchased the first two seasons before we saw this set . this complete set was a much better deal and we have had hours of laughs .
i am pleased to have found a reasonably priced set of this show that i have just started to watch to allow me to catch up with the series at my own pace .
needed season six to complete my collection . great series , wish they would have continued it ! ! dvd 's were in very good condition when they arrived .
i really enjoyed this series and was not disappointed at all in season 1. ca n't wait to get season 2 because they do n't make series like this anymore , plain & simple .
good condition love this movie funny entertaining fun to watch alone or with a group with pop corn . i would recommend this to you
the storyline & acting were a bit hokey but , all in all , i liked the movie . it was entertaining & the giants were my favorite characters
i think the movie was plain fun and nothing less than just great . it was just as good as the first movie .
the dvd was delivered as always in perfect time ! love this horror movie . the best actors luke and kate , and the hotel was really scary !
i could only watch about half the film . i did not care for it at all . my son enjoyed it and had recommended so others may like it .
this is a charming , heartwarming and funny christmas movie which is a must for anyone who loves having a christmas movie collection .
i liked the writing and the plot with lots of twists and turns . this is a very good series to watch
very entertaining . i would recommend to anyone who enjoys english period movies . this is truly a classic movie with wonderful costumes .
like it at all . story line goes all over . did n't understand it . the story line that is ! . price too high !
i love it and i ca n't wait for my son to get old enough , so that i can force him to love it too .
a very good film i recommend to see good love story good ending . i did n't recognize the songs they were good .
season 7 was good , and the story line was more believable and the writing more upbeat . it is terrible that will only be one more season left .
been a long time since i watched this movie . was funny then and is funny now . enjoyed it very much
this season just pulled me in and would n't let me go . went to bed worried about the characters ! really complex characters and familiar relationships in our lives .
this was good if you are looking for the documentary part of the movie . but i didnt keep it . it was a one time watch and i gave it away .
murder she wrote is still a very enjoyable show to watch with interesting plots , good acting and some very familiar faces you will be glad to see .
it is a dvd it was for a gift dont know any thing about it i just need five words
i purchased this album for my sister , a major fan . i was not even aware it was an entire series !
a good storyline that fits around the original . would recommend to all oz fans , young or old . acting could have been better ( oz )
these episodes are so much fun . we will want to watch them over and over . love the acting by these two main girls . they are wonderful .
the 7 book series is phenomenal and the movies do an excellent job of following them . i highly recommend both .
i did love tinkerbell , one of my all time favorite disney characters & amp ; the music was great . a few things could have been changed , but not much .
a must add to any family movie collection me and my kids enjoy watching this one over and over again
i watched this movie not once , but twice , it was so good , i highly recommend it , on my scale , i give it a two thumbs up
a great movie with a wonderful cast ! ! and a good story ! ! the whole movie is a classic story that will live on ! !
i have watched several of these some on youtube and a couple with my kindle , they are good british humor , but you have to like the brits .
what a treat to watch these shows during the holiday season or whenever you need a little lift during the year highly recommend !
purchased this because my grandson loves mickey mouse and i wanted to have something for him to watch when i have him .
the action is this movie is superb . the huge intelligent aliens the soldiers deal with really put fear in the hearts of all involved . great movie ! ! !
i 've seen this on tv and it is quite different from all the other bible scenes , perhaps more accurate and interesting
i had no problems receiving it or looking at it . the movie took me back to when i was a child
the dog that every one loves . you will remember how they got the dog . one family movie truly wonderful the dog that is the boss of the family .
everything 's great about the movie . you do n't get tired of watching it over and over again . it 's what america should be all about !
a good movie with nice twists . nothing spectacular , but overall it was n't a complete waste of time . i probably would n't watch it again though .
i love sci-fi movies besides martial arts and marvel turned movies . this one did n't disappoint ... story may have been lame but the special effects definitely worth it .
the beginning was boring but it gets better as it gets going . whoever played the old crazy lady was very good .
definitely better the second time around . this is one of those movies where sometimes you just do n't get it on the first watching .
her leading man is a talent too but if you love eye candy you must have this simply to see how beautiful audrey is !
as an owner of volumes 1 , 2 , and 3 , i will tell you that i love them all and they are so much fun .
i saw this movie as a kid so when i saw it had to get it for my kids it a great family movie great price and it came fast love amazon
these is also a great movie , my whole family likes the beach party movies
this is a good foreign film . i liked it quite a bit . why do they make up leave a minimum number of words ?
a real change from the popular walt disney version . the grandchildren like it , even the grandsons do n't think it is too bad .
my mother actually bought it and i have n't yet actually watched it right through . she finds it a very good movie .
i actually got this item to replace a dvd i had loaned out and was never returned . both are great stories .
love the show . this is fun to see them interact and enjoy the relationships with each other and the characters .
we have enjoyed watching grace card and after several times watching it we still enjoy the movie . thank you ! we will be ordering again .
this is the top chick flick in my collection - incredible cast and well acted ... great score .
the movie is ok. personally i would take all violence out of children 's movies , now i have to teach the grandson as he watches all of them .
thank you - almost brand new ! the story was wonderful and what you sold was not damaged . we will look to you in the future to purchase from you .
the movie arrived on time and in perfect condition . this 1950 classic is joan crawford at her best . i do n't think joan was acting in this film ; just being her true self .
the continuation of the story is good . the characters interact better than before . the story line of a predictable vampire story is ok .
well , not as good as i 'd hoped it would be . some very colorful language and a few laughs - but not nearly enough to take it to the next level .
i will be returning this item - the disc skips on every cd player or computer i 've tried it on . unwatchable .
will smith always delivers as an actor and i love the sci-fi action . i loved the books in this series and would recommed them to people who like the movie .
this is an easy movie to watch with a great cast and excellent scenery . it will make you laugh and think twice before you try to run your parents life .
what can i say , it 's supernatural and you are either a fan or you or not . going with that said ; we enjoyed season 8 and we both are looking forward to season 9 .
my niece and cousin love this movie so much that love to watch again and who would watch this movie again it is awesome to watch .
this movie is excellent . the acting , the storyline everything the rock did , was awesome in this movie . the story is mildly gripping , and the action is fresh and entertaining .
a nice conclusion the the bourne series . could have used a little more imagination on the ending .
great classic and happy to finally have this film in my collection . one of my favorite movies that i will enjoy for yrs to come .
i like this version as much as the usa based show . the characters and stories really let you see how british legal system works .
i love vin diesel , especially in action movies . pitch black was his first action movie . he is a good actor , and i enjoyed these movies .
i 'm really happy with this purchase . it works perfectly , thank you ! it does n't skip , and the case is in good condition . no problems whatsoever .
two of the all time great actors along with a great supporting cast ! a great story well told with great acting !
i thought the story was well told . acting was excellent . technical production was very well done . overall very entertaining , may be a bit too violent for 10 and under .
the grandchildren as well as the adults all enjoyed this movie.the 3d quality was exactly as expected ... .great ! thank you
this film was really well done but it is very dated . you will need to be an old & # 34 ; film buff & # 34 ; to really enjoy it .
this is a great sequel so she had the baby she was n't in this film , pity ! it 's a very sensitive heartbreaking thrilling horror
a favorite at our house ! good price , fun for the whole family , made a great present ! debbie reynolds and gene kelly ! just makes you feel happy !
so much has been written about this and other versions that i would only be adding to the noise . excellent performances .
this is a good item , enjoyed it very much , was a bit scary , the way i like . i passed it on to a friend .
this is one of my favorite movies . i watched this while taking a train ride to st. louis . i have seen it many times but always find things new in the video .
great series , great writing , some of the best casting i have seen in a series . the pieces fit together so well , and subject matter is always worthy ...
this is a very good movie . it is one of those movies you can watch over and over . would recommend
a very worthy middle movie in a trilogy . i 'm excited to see the final installment . by the way , look quick or you 'll miss the walk on by peter jackson !
great movie i thought , had to own it 's been years since i 've seen this one . a must see you wont regret
wonderfully complex characters . well developed . surprising plot twists . realistic characters beautifully acted . another british masterpiece . i loved it . great series .
i only watched a few minutes with my girlfriend and it just seemed so dumb we just could watch much more of it .
enjoyed watching this again . james bond at it again ! never get tired of watching these even thought the technology used in the day they were shot is not what it is today .
this is not up to denzel best , there were to many bad actors in this movie with him . i was glad i did n't pay full movie prices
good humor but fairly disappointing for the actors involved . i say it is worth watching , but do n't bother moving it to the top of your watch list .
i loved this show but never got to see it from the beginning . i will continue to watch the episodes until i seen them all .
it is an older dvd , but it is a good murder mystery , it also has some light laughs throughout the movie .
for those expecting something like the original movie , you may be disappointed . however , if you like a modern movie on a classic theme then i highly recommend this one .
great actress , a real natural ! it 's always a pleasure watching these old shows . we need to bring back shows like this one !
it was okay , but did n't hold your interest very much . a lot of cheesy lines and at times looked fake . i would n't watch it again .
an old classic movie i have n't seen in a long time . my sister wanted to order it . action packed movie
amazing ! easy to follow , fast paced documentary . i am considering buying a copy as christmas gifts for family and friends !
great movie . my 8 year old and 3 year old girls love this movie .
this is one of the best shows . i loved it . need to see ! ! ! ! ! it was new and scenery and lots of stars
there were some funny parts but mostly not . i guess my husband and i expected it to be much funnier .
did not view all the way . not much of a story to follow , but lots of action . if you just want action go for it .
great movie . i am not a sports fan per say but this was such human and inspirational story that i really enjoyed it
i have been watching these since they aired on cbs when i was a kid . great cartoons for the garfield fans young and old .
really a surprise - enjoyed the story ( its a well told story but i like the new twist on this one ) different and very enjoyable .
this season is definetly not as good as season 1 or 2 but its still funny watching these girls be outrageous
my husband loves this show . the purchase of the dvds made him very happy . that made the purchase worth it .
there is quite a bit of mystery in this movie . it 's a pretty good film to watch .
my husband and i love mysteries , and the british ones are very good . i have other series and hope to view all of the midsomer murders .
my wife says it is a a great movie . we have different taste in movies so she has her movies and i have mine .
saw this at the movie theatre and loved it . wanted it for my movie viewing . ca n't wait to see it again .
i had it in my library of movies for years but it walked out the door and never came back . just had to have it for the grandchildren and me .
for some strange reason , this one has always been my favorite in the series . particularly from the forest scene onto the end . as a child , it had really stuck in my mind .
it is my favorite love movie , well acted and very funny . if you like love stories with humour you will like this .
this is one of the better vampire movies . most of the newer ones are pretty lame , but , lost boys is pretty good
if you like tcm you will like this film , good effects , creepy story and superb acting . get this now .
we have all 21 of the original seasons and have watched them from beginning to end a few times . i ca n't imagine anyone not enjoying this series .
amazon once again delivers . nothing to bring back childhood memories . i will recommend this to anyone who loves a classic cartoon .
great show , great quality dvds . recommend for everyone . it 's a great series with good values being taught . enjoy , enjoy , enjoy !
good story line & actors . the beginning was a lot to follow but the movie had a good story line .
loved this movie before i got it in 3d ! the home version is almost as great as the wide screen .
this is good old movie . not by todays acting standards but for its time it is funny and well made
i have fallen in love with all of these characters . i have discovered that the bbc is very very good at producing excellent series . i am very sorry that this one is at an end .
this blu ray transfer was well done and brought out details that i had missed before . it is a famous movie so i can add little there but the blu ray version was worth my money .
love the series and the quality and shipping of the item were great . still watch this video from time to time . nice to have this to watch when nothing appropriate is on television .
loved watching this series ; some of today 's shows do n't seem to me to be as good as jag because current viewings offered just do n't hold my interest
this is a very good movie for christmas time showing the spirit of giving even from a criminal . very touching movie .
our whole family enjoyed watching this movie , especially my 6 year old . very entertaining and fun , with some adult humor thrown in .
i gave this as a gift to the same person who received the 4th season and she was thrilled ( she now has 4 seasons ) .
def . worth adding to blu ray collection just for the vibrant colors . plot of this movie was okay , just as anyone would expect of course .
keep your expectations low and simply enjoy the comedy and atmosphere . this is pure entertainment not art ! ! ! great halloween fun for the entire family and the kids will learn some new words for the sat !
was well acted , michael j. fox is a funny guy and the show was something the whole family could watch .
great service . purchased this for my daughter who loved this movie when it was first released . gave it to her for christmas .
not what i expected , but diane keaton can pull anything off . i felt her pain over losing her son . all in all , it was good .
this is a good story with a good cast . i enjoyed it very much ! i would recommend this movie to a friend .
many stars that i love starring in this movie . it was funny and touching and just good plain entertainment . i would recommend it to friends .
it is a great story , great actors playing their part to perfection , great sound track , therefore making it one of my favorite movies . i highly recommend it to everyone .
this collection of the final episodes of not only of season 2 and the also the final episodes of the series ! good , worth a watch !
the dvd got here ok. it may be months before i have a chance to review it . since i love shakespeare , i 'm sure it will be grand .
it 's a chance to go back and live life for others instead of for yourself , and learn new lessons too
i 've seen this twice , and it will be one to watch again ; it has good acting , good story , excellent cgi - a thoroughly entertaining movie .
wish there are barbie a mermaid tale 3 ! please do make mermaid there ? ok ? it pretty good than the first one
very satisfied with the product and with the speed of delivery . all was in very good order .
it 's not as advertised . poorly directed , bad acting and really quite boring , i was not pleased with it .
we love this movie and cant wait for the 3rd one in the series . this a move that we can watch over and over .
was in good shape glad i bought it . is a real good love story . will buy more dvd . have used it twice and going to watch it again soon .
great cartoon . brings me back to when i was a little kid watching the marvel action hour with iron man and the fantastic four . a must have for marvel fans .
cool little movie . good for young & old . lots of singing so if you do n't like musicals , this is n't for you .
its not bad but it not anything special either not really something to pay to watch its really not that good
one of stephen king 's better movies . this one is worth a watch . did n't care for all the sequels that came afterwards . i can live without them .
richard is the king of comedy , his movies are classics and will live on forever in our hearts , i 'm glad i got the opportunity to grow up in the 70 's ...
i love this movie . despite some people 's reviews i really enjoyed it . looks great in 3d as well ! i love the wicked witch ! !
i have watched this movie many times . i really like the people chosen for their parts . the premise is interesting and well written . i can recommend this film . thank you amazon
it 's part of the lord of the rings . i am kinda biased because i love this franchise so much . would definitely pay to see it again .
this was a good way to spend a rainy afternoon . sometimes the plot was a little slow going but then it picks up speed and you will not be disappointed .
it was fun watching this with my daughter for the first time . she realized where a number of cultural references that she grew up with came from .
seeing this movie will make you think twice about kids lol . not much to say about it . check it out . what 's the worst that can happen you spend time with people lol
this movie is one of my faves . i ca n't help but watch it everytime i notice it 's on tv . it was better than most 80s movie but not as good as the lost boys .
i 'm so glad that i bought this set . i waited for it to come out . she is so funny . i put on one of her dvd 's whenever i need a laugh .
of course i saw this long ago but forgot what a lovely movie it is . even men like this one .

this was a christmas gift for my daughter in law and she watched it right away and she absolutely loved it .
a cary grant movie my husband enjoyed and wanted for his collection . a great addition to his collection of movies .
surprisingly good movie that my entire family enjoyed , all the way down to our 8 year old daughter . it definitely was n't anything original but it filled saturday night movie night very well .
this is really one of the best comedy tv shows ever , i hope that all seasons to be released .
my son who has read the novels was not impressed with the movie version ... so thumbs down from a 9 year old who read the books . stick with the books .
sidney poitier i am a fan of his early films . i also have & # 34 ; in the heat of the night & # 34 ; a moive that should move you heart .

i bought these for my husband for christmas ... he loves them ! one of his favorite sci-fi shows , it was fun watching them again .
excellent movie based on a true story . tom hanks was awesome in his role ! great entertainment ! i recommend it for everybody to watch if they have n't , i watched it twice !
the quality of the blu-ray transfer is very good . this movie is an excellent detective story and also provides an interesting glimpse of just how difficult life was in europe during the middle ages .
nice romantic comedy i had watched it before so it was kind of cool to watch it again ... really enjoy it !
you can never miss with tom hanks , and this movie follows suit . dvd was in perfect shape and shipped promptly . thanks : )
we rented this for $ 1 before thinking about buying it . the tv show is better . suggest you rent it . we will not be buying this dvd .
i think this version is better than the newer one that came out a couple of years ago . brings back great memories of hanging out with my dad and watching john wayne movies . loved it !
i was looking for a friday night thriller and after watching the trailer , i was sold ! this was so much fun ! loved it !
this movie is a special kind of christmas , one that everyone needs to see about how we touch each others lives

brilliant ! one of the best of this type of film from the golden era . it is a treasure for any collector .
yep , now this is a good movie . i recommend it to anyone who is interested in watching this one , for sure !

i love midsomer murders and have watched all the sets , and look forward to the new ones now . highly recommended
this play had me and my hubby rolling around , laughing till we could not laugh anymore . if you like a good play , with laughs and christian themes , this is for you .
this is a wonderful movie . i got one for me and my 18 year old grandson , he loves the movie .
had seen the first movie , and thought i would enjoy the others in the set . i have to say that i was disappointed , and ended up selling this to someone else .
great show i love it one of the best hbo shows of all time a great conclusion to a great show
this dvd has a lot of hard to find 70 's movies rolled into one . it is definitely worth the money .
after watching several different productions on dvd at our opera club i have purchase a 3 of dvd 's of different productions of this opera , i like this one the best .
i bought this movie because i already own part one and so naturally part two completes my collection . it was exactly as described . great condition and delivered on time . i am totally satisfied
if you liked the dvd & # 34 ; big changes & # 34 ; , you 'll love this one too . a continuation of big changes , it 's just as enjoyable as the first .
i loved the shows in these seasons . i have now all seasons and ca n't wait to see when the next seasons come out
my daughter loves this movie ( just like every little girl i imagine ) and sings the songs all the time . the show has a great story and is n't too annoying to watch as a parent .
liked the series when it was first on tv and enjoy watching these again . simon baker does a great job of playing a likeable bad boy trying to be good .
i was hoping for a little more substance to this movie . dancing was good though .
this would be an awesome movie if it was n't for that . i 'm glad i watched it first without my kids !
watched this video when i was a kid and wanted a copy for myself . still a good show for the kids to watch .
if you are looking at this , you know it is good . i dont have to tell you that you should buy them all . seriously
i love even watching them on tv but to have them and be able to watch them anytime i want is the best
a very good movie about a wonderful singer . another movie that i can watch over and over and not get tired of it .
i have always wanted to see this . i know it 's an old movie but i 'm going to enjoy watching it .
i have not laughed so hard since the original hangover . this comedy is in a class of its own . leo is unbelievably hilarious ! highly recommended !
i bought this dvd mostly for the inner light , but all of the episodes are great . this is a great deal for any star trek fan !
have always liked how burt reynolds always had the same people in his movies . this is certainly not high cinema , but it was fun back then , and still kind of funny .
this is a very good movie . it was very exciting and kept me interested through the very end .
great action , great cast . ca n't wait for the next one . the end of this one leaves another sequel guaranteed . i hate it when they do that !
this show is intriguing and keeps you entertained . there is a great story line and it will keep you at the edge of your seat .
this is one of my grandson 's favorite movies . the story is cute . the music is awesome . this is good family entertainment because us older folks loved it as much as the kids .
i remember watching this growing up . it is a bit cheesy but good 80 's fun , and you ca n't beat that .
i very much enjoyed this movie . i liked this better than some of the other batman movies . i would recommend this over some of the other movies .
good for all ages . the characters are good to look at and believable . i like the story a lot . awesome

i love this movie ! this is for sure one you should put in your collection ! very good transaction , so no need to put off the purchase !
i 've seen this movie on the on demand free movies and i loved this movie when i watched it on tv for free . i 'm glad that i have this on dvd to own .
i 've watched this one a few times now and still laugh at it . who can resist betty white ? ! that being said , if you can resist her , pass on this movie
always a outstanding nicholas sparks read really like his books and movies they stay close to the book . great outstanding ! ! ! !
great story . awesome acting . fabulous scenes . cool movie . clint has done a lot of impressive films over his accomplished career - this is my favorite ! ! !
criminal minds : the sixth season is really a thinking persons show it has plots to keep you guessing and the ability to make you care about the cast . it is well worth watching many times .
this movie is good even if you have not read the book you will know what is happening all the way through .
what took them so long ! if you enjoyed the andy griffith show in the 60s you do n't need a long boring description . just buy it !
this show has great acting and fantastic characters ! its a great show from start to finish ! if you like comedy and syfy you will like it .
a good movie for a sunday afternoon . it was entertaining , and andrew mccarthy is always a good performer to watch .
one of the worst movies i 've ever seen . yes , it had a few parts that were disgusting but for the most part it was just slow and really stupid .
one of the following movies to the series , only buy this if you watched and liked the anime series . i reviewed the anime series .
this ai n't your normal sci-fi just trying to make it work with blood , guts , horror and special effects . nice plot twists will make you think .
my mom and i wanted this , thought it was a good movie . it was a good movie night . had a little bit of everything . the story is something that everyone can relate too .
i enjoyed watching this movie along with my two granddaughters . i highly recommend this for the girls . it is good to add to the barbie collection .
great movie , first chance i 've had to replace an old vhs copy i 've had for years . not only a classic movie , but a great cast . all these great actors are now gone .
i am a fan of british tv . this was excellent . great actors , story and excellent setting . looking forward to watching the whole series .
i missed it so much i had to buy it . i could n't resist . it 's just a fun show to watch . the families and the friendship make it a great find .
i saw this when it was in theaters and just saw it again with my daughter . it 's still a fun movie .
one of the best mini series i 've ever watched ! it is fantastic that there are people in hollywood that still remain true to their faith .
still one of my favorites after all these years . well-written dialog and plenty of action makes fun for the whole family . a must-have for any true transformers fan .
i enjoy watching this series from time to time and i still enjoy it . the quality is great and not disappointing .
the last movie in the series that both my husband and i love . i wanted it so we can watch them whenever we want and commercial free .
love that they have been releasing the 70s and 80s shows . i 'm not a television watcher now , too much sex , violence , and language . love the chemistry between lee and amanda .
i love this movie . it 's a classic . i 'm glad i was able to purchase it on instant video . movie night !
i enjoyed the premise of this movie and looked forward to watching it . it seemed to fall apart and i did n't like anything after the 25 minute mark .
i really like this show , but the first season was not a funny as i remembered . i 'm sure it will get better as the characters develop . i 'm excited for the next few seasons .
this is a great classic film that i have seem many times over the years and it is always a good one to go back to . even my grandson liked it .
i liked this movie better than the first movie judge dredd played by sylvester stallone but then i like karl urban .
arrived on time and was new as promised . great price . great dvd of john wayne , are n't they all ? great price .
not sure why this was such a dud in the theater . it could certainly have been better , but it was a reasonably enjoyable movie .
one of the burns ' brothers best - amazing amount of research and information but time goes by so fast its presented in such an interesting way . great educational tool .
i 've always loved this movie ... and even more now that my daughter is old enough to watch this and enjoy it with the wife and me .
nothing imaginative here . really no good acting . certainly no good writing . an action film without much compelling action . i would n't recommend it .
the movie was okay . it had action , some suspense and even though it was based on actual events , i would n't rent it again .
this has always been one of my all time favorite series . a must have for , let 's say , the older set . lol
zany and funny , well written and well acted . a bit silly and over the top but highly entertaining . a great date movie .
so much more to this story than expected . for the young at heart who grew up on mary poppins . emma thompson is wonderful .
i first only saw the first episode and knew that i had to own it . this is a great anime .
this film is a definite winner , with an outstanding beginning , middle and end . the film is action packed and well acted , as well as produced .
love paul hogan in this series good fun and great continuing plot a a a a a a a a
i 've seen these movies time and time again . i wanted the entire set so i could watch them commercial free whenever i want to see them . great purchase

a classic movie and one of bogart 's best , everyone should see it . many good quotes from it . it is a timeless movie .
i loved this movie ! the end , when things are revealed , was a total surprise to me . good acting , good action and overall just a great movie .
had to get season 5. it 's so sad . love sam & dean ! the heartbreaking , world saving choices they make !
one of the funniest movies ever made . it 's a thriller as well . the stars are in top form . watch it !
boring movie and i did not like it at all . i love matthew mcconaughey but this was a waste of his time and mine .
a good arnold bloody , action packed movie ! ! pretty good for an aging actor ! ! good story line !
a great segal movie where he takes care of a problem that needs to be done .
what an amazing adventure , captured on film ! i had no idea that this footage existed - so glad we discovered it !
have not got to watch yet , but i should get to it in a few days really like superman , just wish i had his powers .
good actors , but plot will leave you with bad feeling . sad for our society . cruel killing , crazy people . very sad .
it is great having all 4 movies in one boxset and at a great price you ca n't go wrong with adding these awesome movies to your collection
it was ok , but i could tell you at the beginning what was going to happen . i like ones i ca n't figure out .
received the dvd have not viewed it yet but it appears to be new as promised . thank you
i really enjoyed this movie . it 's easy to see that it was filmed a while ago but it 's still good .
this was a different type of movie than i usually watch . it was ok. i do understand that it came from comics and that is why i watched it .
i liked it a lot to put it simple i can say more but i do n't want to waste time telling you i do n't regret buying it
i 'll watch anything he appears in , and i saw this movie years ago . goldie hawn was even less annoying than usual ; it holds up well .
another disney adventure movie . ca n't wait til my grandson it of age to watch this with me . i know he will enjoy it too .
awesome special effects for a mostly done on blue screen movie , lots of extras , great addition to battlestar galactica series .
if you are looking for sex ... ... forget it ! however if you want to watch a good movie that is serious and somewhat reflects history ... this is it !
i used to watch this movie on lifetime every time it came on so i was so excited that they had it available to buy .
this is a great family movie . you can sit down with your children for a night of family get together and popcorn and have a good clean time .
great animated series for the whole family and a definite classic for all time . if you do n't like the movie , you will love this , for it is somewhat opposite of it !
i love bleach . i own all bleach up to box set 6 and hope to get more . i share them with friends .
i watched the first season and had to see the second season . it definitely has a twisted and great plot line .
got here in good time and looked to be in good shape . can ; t wait to watch it again . such a good movie . you should give this one a try !
my son loves this movie and so did my mother in law they are both big baseball fans and really enjoyed it
this was a great miniseries addition to the spartacus series . while the spartacus character was not seen , it really gave back story to the characters that made him what he became in later seasons . great series !
wished we had good clean movies like this still . enjoyed so much , good family entertainment . would highly reccomend for anyone
worth watching but not really that scary for me . others may be scared by this movie but it was more like a scary documentary
got this to go along with the original movie . we are happy with all three of the cinderella movies made .
ive been wanting this movie for over twenty five years . i saw this movie when i was a teenager . im so happy to finally have it .
the story is pure fantasy . the music is great . the costuming and set design are over the top beautiful . do not know why it did not win an oscar .
this was a heart warming and hilarious movie . the entire family truly enjoyed watching this again and again . thank you !
this is one of my favorite clint eastwood movies , and the second one called any which way you can came with it . with clint eastwood you ca n't go wrong .
i first saw this movie years ago and thought about it the other day . was very excited to see that amazon had a copy , and it came very quickly and in great shape .
my husband and i saw this movie several years ago and loved it from the start . was a for sure must have to our christmas movie collection .
this was such a pleasure to watch again . i would recommend anyone that has not seen this show before , buy it ! you will love it !
this is one of the best movies of all times . every year or so , i get this feeling that forces me to look up the movie and enjoy it once again ... addicted ! ! : )
this era has always intrigued me and this series and the characters within , portray it very well . looking forward to more episodes .
i enjoy watching this movie with the twists and turns . it ended with happy ending and kept me on the edge of my seat thinking and wondering .
just an easy watch before i go to bed . the show is a classic and fun . this one is not as exciting as the previous seasons .
my sister loves this show and was happy when i got this for her . she has watched and loves it
the storytelling and speaking style is different from the previous seasons , some are different voice actors . it 's okay , but definitely different .
the expendables is a very good movie love the one liners very funny looking forward for part 3 all the stars for one movie brilliant idea stallone love both expendables
this movie sucked it was not even worth the money it did n't even make any sense i swear there has to be a part 1
character is too hard and too tough for too long . no one could hold a job with that attitude . too much profanity .
price was great and i received the package sooner than expected . i love this series , so ended up buying the dvd - still hoping it will come back on tv soon
i think the bluray looks good . anyone who thinks too much into this stuff needs a life . van damme is bad ass as usual and never gets enough credit .
probably my favorite all time 007 movie . i was really pleased to find this on prime for no extra charge . always fun , suspenseful and with a touch of bond humor .
hard to find a gay film these days that has any production values . this was well-acted , poignant , and visually satisfying . good film .
this is one of my favorites great singing great storyline all in all needs to be long and everybody 's library
it 's a documentary . really slow start and slow presentation . i could not finish watching it , if you like documentaries you might enjoy this .
i really like this movie . it is a great romance and mel gibson is one of my favorite actors . was surprised that my purchase arrived so quickly . can wait to watch this favorite again .
fun movie with a great cast . it 's a little slow getting going but worth it in the end . those guys have a lot to teach us all on how to enjoy and live life .
bringing all the avengers together into one movie was a masterful move . the special effects are awesome . thor and iron man play the best characters !
this was an awesome show my sons even liked it . watch it though make sure the dvds play on your dvd player before you do anything else .
got this dvd for the grandchildren when they come to visit . they just loved it and watched it several times .
another great movie good for kids to watch also michael keaton is great in this role cant say enough about it
would highly recommend this movie as it is a realistic truth about history and the powerful catholic church . not at all what i expected .
the 3 pink panther movies were a great deal ! they were funny movie . the movies came in good order and quickly .
i enjoy this moving ever time i watch it . its definitely a tear jerker , thats why i had to have the dvd
i loved this movie . it made me cry but the acting and the music were just great . it drew you into the story very quickly .
this was highly rated , but i was n't all that excited about it . it was average as far as acting and story line in my opinion .
i always loved the series , and now i own all four reasons . it is good tv watching for anyone who remembers tv before special effects took over .
i think that this is the best of the & # 34 ; twilight & # 34 ; movies . i loved all of the series but this was by far , the best .
another great addition to our midsomer collection . especially at an affordable price . we look forward to adding more sets as well ...
i love this movie but lost it to a fire , and i had to get it again . its a really good movie !
i am a big fan of this series . although i do have to add there were some episodes that i did n't like .
great family story ! highly recommend it . most of us can relate to some part of it , for sure . original as well .
great & classic movie ! what makes it even better , is that whitney houston is singing throughout the movie . miss that voice !
while this season is n't as good as 5 or 6 it 's hard to complain when even a bad doctor who episode ( for me ) is still better than most anything else on tv .
love it - quality excellent - great in the theater , great on dvd . books better , but that 's usually the case : - )
this was a great collection . all of the movies in this set were entertaining , moving , at times suspenseful , and definitely something the entire family could enjoy . that 's always nice .
it was great to see alot of the older actresses with there clothes off again .
this movie has one spot that skips other than that it 's great . kids love it . thanks a bunch for all .
to mark the 20th anniversary of this wonderful film . it has so many special & wonderful features that any fan will love .
if you love them on tv you 'll love them even more on dvd where you can watch any time you want .
very good ! i do n't know if i like the second season as much but the first season was pretty good .
could n't wait to have this movie . what a great ending to a great series ! delivery was prompt and was very pleased to receive it . love the potter movies !
interesting considering it 's based on true events . acting was n't great . i would say it 's worth watching even though the acting was n't very good .
i remember watching this film as a kid . it is nostalgic to me now . not the greatest of movies , but the younger generation likes it . my younger brother sure does .
intense and well done home invasion thriller . i loved the weird feel of this and the surprises kept me entertained . missed it in the theater but will watch it again soon .
i really am not into new tv shows , too much blood , too much core , too much ... i like this because it is fun .
enjoyed the joy . have n't seen it in a long time . love disney movies and this was no exception . it has nice characters and a good family show to watch .
the fact that i could only watch 30 minutes of it does n't count . ca n't believe they all sang live . nice set .
this movie is a classic . you do n't need me to tell you that . there are very few movies that i will watch twice . this i could watch twice a week and still laugh .
i already liked this movie and this dvd was in excellent shape and a pleasure to watch ... it is a great story if you do n't mind facts and you can accept facts as they are .
i am waiting to get this great movie on dvd , its about time it came out on dvd
lots of back ground of her life . not much focus on what she did and how it was received . i would not recommend . acting was very good however .
i think there should have been more episodes ... ... hopefully , more to the series will be produced . talent in series was very captivating .
a tense film of the cold war era that makes one almost feel as if you are there !
it is so good it needs no introduction . the plot line is just enough and the plot is excellent and engaging
it was ok but not as good as the first one . i may watch it again sometime but i 've watched the original a dozen times and will again .
i have seen this movie quite a few times . though it is a bit old it is still great for its time .
i think that this is his best special hes ever done and i bought this used and looked just as good as the new ones . s
great movie , good price deal , came in no time , good condition , awesome movie recommend anyone to who likes action and adventure in movies
it liked all the stories , they were interesting and different . i recommend series to any that likes horror stories and looking for something more than zombies .
comedy , action , romance , social commentary , blood , great actors and great performances . if you have n't seen this you are in for a treat .
loved it a long time back so i knew i would like it more now so i got it again
my granddaughter 's favorite princess and favorite movie . how could this not be a great purchase . really pleased with this movie
it was entertaining , but could have been better . too pg , if you know what i mean . needs more gore and and more excitement , it was just a bit slow .
loved this movie . if you love elvis movies then this is a must . it was a great movie but then i think all of elvis movies are great .
this movie was very interesting and exciting at the same time . lots of action and a little strange , but good .
peter falk was perfect for the role of columbo . he made you laugh , cry and always wonder what he was going to do or say next !
my brother told me this was a must see so i bought it and i loved every bit of it
i saw this movie when i was a child and i didnt remember it until my mother asked me to look for it . i remembered it and bought for her . we both love watching it .
i bought this 3 movie pack as a gift for my grand daughter . she loves these type movies . try it for yourself .
i love liam neeson ! the unknown was one of his better movies . i really liked the part he played as well as the climax of this movie !
you ca n't not love smallville . if you are a fan of super heros , then you are going to love this show .
ok this move was a great movie , i am so glad i have it in my collection ! as i could not imagine it without it !
bought this without knowing anything about it . kids and i watched it and were surprised at how much action it had and it held our full attention for the full movie .
i should have bought this one instead of just renting it . i enjoyed it and so did the kids . maybe for the new year i will buy it .
this is a musical that i can sit down and watch over and over again . my 18 year old daughter was amazed that i knew all the words to all the songs .
per memories . one of the first movies i ever saw . beautiful hawaii .

excellent as a movie , then a vhs tape , then two different dvds , now a blu-ray . get it now , who fans !
i watched the trailer and was expecting more . it 's an okay popcorn movie but was n't as good as i 'd hoped it would be . the characters are pretty shallow and the ending is stupid

i love iron man he is so funny and powerful . i like hero movies and this is a good one .

this movie is cheap laughs nothing special but nothing bad . just the common every day movie . but how can i complain it was 5 $ when i got it .
a good movie ! kept my interest . it was a sensitive movie and had its comedy . not a funny movie but one with a message ! i will watch it again and again .
they have the second movie to this one , but love this one just as much ! ! was delivered quickly and works perfectly . thank you ! !
as long as you can handle reading subtitles and you enjoy martial arts and action movies this movie is a must see .
one of my all time favorite mystery `` who done it '' films . great plot and great acting .

this is a great movie something i would recommend to anyone and if you love horse 's you will love this story
ordered this for a friend an she loved it ! she just loves to watch this movie . although kinda hard to watch .
it may have been a lesson on & # 34 ; be careful on what you wish for & # 34 ; . i would n't watch it again , but do n't regret watching it .
this is also a wonderful film from the 1950 's . i enjoyed seeing these films then and definitely love seeing the films on dvd now .

i 'm going to give this to my daughter for christmas . we have these shows on vhs , but well be better on dvd ,
this movie was horrible ! ! it made no sense what so ever ! it was boring and it did nothing to hold my attention .
this man was so way ahead of his time . is life was to short but his music will be around forever ! worth any amount .
it was really great that we found 1 dvd that add all 3 movies in a set . really good deal .
this movie was not what my wife and i were expecting . it was better . well acted , well written , well shot . what more can i say ?
one of the best old movies from the 60 's entertaining . movie is a great adventure to watch . grab a bowl of popcorn a drink and sit down to watch something very entertaining .
great price for all the discs . the movie itself it bad to the bone , ca n't wait for 2 and 3 .
i thought the movie was funny ; kevin james always makes me laugh . if you 're a fan of kevin james , you 'll enjoy this movie .
this a great cast and none stop action , the two main characters are absolutely fantastic together and has a superb storyline . makes another great addition to western collection .
it was a good film but it moved slow in spots . the acting was well done and the plot was interesting
my 2 1/2 year old grand daughter just loves curious buddies and this one has not disappointed her . she loves it !
pretty predictable , but still entertaining . i liked this movie the best of the series , and had seen them all so had to finish with this one .
this product worked fine for me . nice movie that i enjoy watching more than once . shipped in good time and in good shape .
i mainly purchased it for our sons . i enjoyed the movie , but my boys loved it ! we highly recommend this movie .
i did n't particularly like or dislike this film ... truth be told it was on sale and i bought it to add to my collection of lifetime movies on dvd .
what a nice bonus to have 2 seasons in one . i enjoy watching this series as much as i enjoy shopping amazon .
it 's wayne 's world ... so you know it is funny . but i do n't think it is as funny as the first wayne 's world . but all and all i still enjoyed it .
even though i am a big transformers fan , because i use to have some of those toys since i was a kid .
you just might be surprised by the way it ends . from start to finish , this series was truly great .
this is a very good movie and a good product despite the lack of extended version . excellent special features .
where are the season 3 dvds ? why is it such an issue to get them released ?
the first season did n't really grab me , but the second season has me riveted . i love it ! i look forward to each episode .
this movie is action-packed with wonderful scenery . tom cruise does an excellent job of acting . i believe this film won an academy award .
very good i would watch it just because its star trek , but even through it was well done it is a bit like the first one !
i bought this cd to complete my bond movies , one of the best ! the bond movies already have a space for this movie
i ca n't believe it is 2013 and i 'm just now watching this movie ! where have i been ? this movie is worth the watch !
very good story line . i could really relate to the characters as i saw myself growing up . exceptional acting . i would watch it again .
was n't expecting much but was surprised how great this movie ended up being . it was action packed and a fun ride . i 'm definitely a fan of both of the main actors now !
it is amazing how this guy could turn everything into an fun journey in life . even when he is walking into his death , he tries to make it fun for the son . i am very impressed .
loved watching it over and over . cant wait for the next season to come out . this seller will always be on my list to use over and over .
i had no idea that this movie had so much scary stuff and scared me a little . just a little .
really enjoyed this series . ca n't wait for the next season on dvd . made a great gift for my daughter . thanks .
this is a great remake of the classic . i enjoyed it more than i thought i would . i love the graphics in this movie .
i thought the movies was good but a little to dark for my taste . it could have shown more of the street life they had to do
i have watched this sooo many times . it 's so sad & so great all at the same time . i got a second one for my granddaughter . she loves it as well .
great fan of meryl streep who is so versatile as an actor . glad there is a source at amazon to get great movies at a reasonable cost .
it reminded me of the harry potter series of movies . the first was the best movie and the last just completed the series .
really can you not like something johnny does . it is great nothing like the original . this is a fun movie not really for young children .
i had the cover and was glad you had just the dvd . the kids love this movie as well as myself !
not as great as the first one , but still well worth watching . the obvious talent in the cast is just great
ca n't wait for the next season ( 4 ) to be available ! ! ! characters are portrayed as if you are living in that time .
one of the first anime series i ever watched and got me hooked on all the rest , if you have not seen this series you dont know what you are missing ! !

this is a great movie i love it well done i love tom hanks he does such a great job
this movie kept my interest and was fun to watch . good actors too . i would recommend it to the action movie fan .
this is a classic movie , i saw it over 30 years ago and was so move by it i had to added into my movies collection
i thought i was n't going to like it but from the get go the story is riveting and exciting . great show
it was not as good as the first one but i really enjoyed it all the same , would buy it again
what would you do if the circumstances were the same with your daughter ? i found the movie very realistic , and it is one i would watch again and recommend to others .
great sexy and fun that makes fun of that other movies -- this bat is more sexy than the male model of the same -- also their joker not half bad

enjoyed in theater . wanted to see again as you miss things first time around . usually buy movies i enjoy watching .

i remember watching this movie as a little kid , and it is just as great as i remember it . it looks amazing on blu-ray too . worth getting .
if you like scifi as i do , you will like this series . one of my favorites on amazon prime . i recommend this show .
i love this movie i saw it in the theatre and could n't wait for it to come out on dvd i was surprised to see it on the free streaming videos .
very good dvd . again , this was the very same saturday serial that i saw at the movie theater when i was a kid .
but the story was pretty good . i thought the acting was done very well . i just wish it had more laughs in it .
i ordered and received the movie brand new . i had no problems playing the movie or anything . it 's an awesome movie and i would highly reccommend it to those who have not seen it .
another great christian bale performance . he was really psycho . i watched this movie and was impressed with his early acting . he 's an awesome actor . a must buy for fans .
i think this movie is n't bad at all , yeah it 's not a movie i want to watch all the time but i think it is a fine low budget zombie flick , check it out .
great dvd . has some classics on it . bought it for my 22 year old daughter , she loves it .
very entertaining with a different twist . not much of a mystery but i enjoyed the different characters and their situations
this is an exciting season because jim and pam get married and have their daughter ! the wedding is one of my favorite episodes , it 's so cute ! definitely one of the best seasons !

what 's not to love , picture is great , story is a kaye classic , and remember , it 's yours you earned it ! .
i enjoyed this movie and would recommend to most audiences . good plot with some really hilarious times . jennifer was great as usual .
did n't deserve the effort . sadly horrible script , acting and filming . and what else can i say to make the point ?
used to watch this show in the 90s and now my teenager is watching this show . great family show . still makes me laugh . loved how the package has the design of the house .
this tv show makes you feel like you were there . i decided to go hunting with my son just as an excuse to shoot something !
high action movie and better than excellent computer graphics . the only thing keeping it from 5 stars is a little weak on the story line . overall pretty good though .
was entertaining but probably won ; t watch it again . would have been much better to have watched it by streaming it down on amazon rather than purchasing the bluray .
the box came damaged . not particularly happy . do n't want to pay the money to send it back just for the box . hopefully the dvd works
i like this when it first came out on tv and still like it even today . wish they would come out with a new series to continue the story line .
i love to be entertain and have action at the same time . love all the actors . keep it up , bruce and company !
this is a classic i love harvey and we were very pleased with everything thank you
the picture quality was something to be desired . the story line seemed familiar but had some creative genius in making an enjoyable movie.i ca n't say i loved it but it was very cute ! !
andy williams christmas special brings back many happy memories from my childhood . used to enjoy watching his t.v . specials .
was delivered as promised and we enjoyed watching this dvd . our previous one got damaged and it 's nice to know this one was a click away
i thought this was going to be a great movie but got so depressed with the first 1/2 hour or so that i turned it off .
season 5 was the best ever . i do n't know how they can make this even better ! i ca n't wait to see 5 b !
this program was one of the best ever created ! they are awesome characters . the only weird thing is that last episode ... who were those people anyway ? ? ?
movie was alot better than i had thought it would be . loved the way all the famous actor and actress played their part .

the real story of alice in wonderland the politically correct do not want you or your children to know about
i will add it to my library of dvds and it will be available if i choose to use it .
i 've watched this at least a dozen times and it never gets old . a tight thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat and has held up well over the years . a classic .
the best dracula of all times , hammer film was one of the best producer of horror films in the 70 's
this is my favorite series movie . i love it soooo much . it is a must watch . this one of the sad parts of the series
good acting and a storyline that continued throughout the first season made this a gripping series . plus a glimpse of ellen page before she made it big in hollywood .
this movie gives you more details about rose red . love anything and everything from stephen king . something to watch more than once .
excellent lawyer show balanced with excellent drama . the characters are fantastic and the storylines are often relevant to current events .
got what i asked for - a good classic that my little boy loves to watch : )
i have watched the 3 seasons and want more . love his character , determination and how good of a detective his is .
classic story and has become a tradition to watch around halloween and again around christmas ! jack is the very best !
ordered by mistake . wanted & # 34 ; catching fire . i already have this movie and it extremely good and follows the book well .
great buy great story . i highly recommend this series you will not be disapointed money well placed in adding this to your collection .
my children have seen all three versions of this movie , and all three of my children agree , this is the best movie to watch .
this purchase was made after a friend shared her copy with me . i decided to make it a part of my collection as i knew that i would enjoy watching it more that once .
was a gift for my boyfriend . we loved the movie and showed it to his entire family . very good story too , would recommend to all ! good seller experience too , arrived fast .
some of these movies were ok and some were old movies . most are b movies , but a fair value if you want to add to your collection .

this is a great show and i would say everyone should watch it and enjoy . it has action and fun . i think it is great .
not a fan of the actors ' portrayal . more a fan of the more serious versions of batman . prefer the newer versions .
first liam neeson movie i have watched . the plot is good and the acting is great ; for the most part believable .
i found the movie to be humorous and an enjoyable watch . of course not the greatest movie i have ever seen , but well worth renting through the instant video service .
this is more of a thriller than a horror movie . decent but not great . predictable for the most part . not scary at all .
probably in the top three of his movies ever . superior performance , great story , travolta at his best , fine supporting cast
there are some really good ones , and i am looking forward to watching the rest . however will let you know later .
wife and i enjoyed this very much . good story line , good acting , good action scenes , good soundtrack . we recommend this movie .
good movie good actors . a keeper overall . i do n't know this one as well as the others but all in all a good movie .
really good film and an outstanding performance from diana ross , michael jackson and the rest of the actors . it will keep you and your kids entertained !
very enjoyable , sweet story and well acted . little sad at the end . i would recommend it for a nice evening 's viewing .
this is a wonderful , not well known ( at least to me ) flick with a great plot and a lot of humor thrown in .
have loved this movie since the first time that i watched it ! ! great story ! ! ! adam sandler is always great ! ! !
this is so touching . i am afraid they do n't make many good movies anymore . i wonder what has happened to people 's taste these days
it is a great book . i loved it . it is great . even my husband read it . now my friend is .
i was extremely happy with the delivery time , and movie was in condition as stated , would by again . yours truly happy customer .
most of the stories told here i had seen before . nothing special for me here . i should give it a 2 star rating .
great movie lots of exciting features it shows an in depth story about the making of the hobbit and the movie is wonderful
this is a great show . great action & adventure , and the main character is always trying to do the right thing in very complicated circumstances . a must watch tv series !
this movie was your average vampire movie but was still really good . i was surprised that an obvious low budget film was so good .
good story line that keeps you coming back for more . we look forward to watching the conclusion of this first season and will likely move on to watching season 2 .
very low budget and the actors are horrible . the title and cover looks good but this movie will make you upset after purchasing .
cute movie - good for adults as well as kids . my husband especially liked it and he usually only likes the shoot 'em up kind of movies ! ! ! i highly recommend this movie !
xmas gift for 2012 for my son , he 's been wanting this dvd for some time . i cant wait till he opens it
i love the characters , rich and real . perfectly cast . the emotions and lessons are wonderful . i 've watched it twice and will watch again .
being a fan of the planet of the apes , i believe this is a great installment into the series and a great different way to approach the film !
excellent film ! absolutely love wes anderson ! great to watch with your kids ! shipping was quick , and a great price for blu-ray . got the digital copy right away . great product for anyone to buy !
just not my kind of movie . did n't enjoy it . i should not of brought it . it will be more careful in ordering .
i just ca n't explain it . i just do n't like it . i do n't like the gore aspect i guess , i would n't want kids watching this , but i see gore is in .
not the best movie i 've seen but if you just need a couple of laughs this movie is a good one to watch .
enjoyed movie years ago , and was excited to get again . enjoyed singing along with the movie and remembering the story .
think of the worst movie you 've ever going to see . it must be better then this was . it was boring
i was really blown away by how good the 3d was on this one . in my top 10 best 3 d movies . i have over 25 of them . check this one out .
one of katherine hepburn ` s finest performances ! certainly her best tv movie performance ! writing , directing , cinematography , costume design all above average !
when it comes to family movies and fun , its hard to beat disney . great picture and great sound ; these movies never get old !
the girls in the first two versions had some appeal , and the bad guys were sort of believable . this version lacked both elements .
for the love of cowboys this is a must see . robert duvall and tommy lee jones are at their best . excellent story about a long journey and the friendship between two great cowboys .
who does n't like scooby doo ? everyone grew up watching this character . i did , my children and now my grandchildren . i love mysteries and i would recommend it to everyone .
this story shows the effect the important people have on our life , as well as the importance of quality of life .
ordered this as a gift , great price , very funny i would recommend this
another great stallone movie . high speed all go no quite living the fast life movie . great storyline and great acting
this is a great movie for the whole family . especially if you are into baseball and love a good laugh !
my five year old grandson loved these short stories and found them very entertaining , laughed a lot and wanted to see them again immediately .
ok , we know this collection will be the ultimate , so lets stop wasting time with these reviews and stars and come out with volume two .
one of my all time favorites especially to give to kids . i rate this among the best especially for general audience movies .
i love this show . probably the best hbo series made to date . if you never had the chance to watch the series i suggest you give the sopranos a shot .
great way to buy just the seasons you need or really liked . great price since these are hard to find . and i loved the free shipping and quick delivery .
love watching these old sci fi movies . the land unknown is rather hard to find and is really a good movie for its time period . i remember watching it when i was a kind .
i love this movie , it 's hilarious and has a nice message . jim carrey did an excellent job on this one .
i have not seen this dvd yet , but do like the movie . i viewed this earlier , and decided to buy my own copy .
