a generic international version of a typical american horror film .

despite bearing the paramount imprint , it 's a bargain-basement european pickup .
this sci-fi techno-sex thriller starts out bizarre and just keeps getting weirder .
do n't expect any surprises in this checklist of teamwork cliches ...

sushi for the connoisseurs of the macabre .
the whole thing plays like a tired tyco ad .

a waste of fearless purity in the acting craft .
fails to satisfactorily exploit its gender politics , genre thrills or inherent humor .
b . ) that sure is pathetic !

an artsploitation movie with too much exploitation and too little art .
